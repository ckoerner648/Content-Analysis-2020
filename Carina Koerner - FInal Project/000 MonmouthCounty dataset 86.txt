MonmouthCounty;George Moss;1923;2000;George Moss, 1923, 2000          George H. Moss Jr. in 1925  Date of Interview:  June 30, 2000   Name of Interviewer:  Douglas Aumack  Premises of Interview: Mr. Moss' home, Rumson, NJ  Birth date of subject: March 2, 1923    Mr. Aumack: Before we start, Mr. Moss, it's an honor to interview you, so thank you very much.    Mr. Moss: Well, thank you for coming here.    Mr. Aumack: How did you come to Monmouth County?    Mr. Moss: More or less by osmosis, because my great-grandmother summered in Long Branch in the 1870s. Both sets of grandparents summered in Long Branch. Actually on my mother's side, that grandfather ran a hotel in Long Branch. When my parents married they were in New York City and I was born in New York City. We came down and visited my grandparents, and that is the background of why we were here. That's really the background of why I have an interest in this, because conversation was always about what had happened in Long Branch and Sea Bright. From 1870 on, somebody remembered something. We had oral history at the dinner table.    Mr. Aumack: Do you recall some of that oral history?    Mr. Moss: Well, there was so much of it I guess I'm not too good on names anymore at my age, but I remember for example my grandmother, whose husband Gernand  Pannaci ran the Pannaci Hotel in Long Branch, talking about the various people that stayed there. There were a lot of prominent people and now I don't remember their names, but it was interesting to hear who was there. I remember they talked about storms that had happened and it was just like anybody would sit down at the table and say I remember a couple of years ago we did this and that. Well, my grandmothers could remember much further back than that.    Mr. Aumack: When did you begin to permanently live in Monmouth County?    Mr. Moss: When I got married. Of course we had the house since 1944, but it was the summer house. We came down in the summer time and came down on the weekends in the winter. My parents had an apartment in New York City and when Mary Alice and I married, I said, "Hey, we have a house going to waste," so we just stayed here. Then when our first child arrived, my parents decided they weren't going to go back for the week and come down on the weekend. They wanted to be with the new baby, so they moved in too. It was big enough for all of us. So, they got rid of the apartment and stayed with us.    Mr. Aumack: How old were you when you moved to Monmouth County?    Mr. Moss: Well, we have to back up. I was born in New York City and then in 1927, I believe, maybe 1928, my parents rented a house in Silver White Gardens, which is in Little Silver. As a matter of fact, that house they rented was seen a year earlier being moved from the corner of Broad Street and Pinckney Road, the site now where the Gertrude Apartments are. The house was moved from there, and it's still in Silver White Gardens. So we were there, and I went up to the third grade in St. James but I also developed a very severe case of double pneumonia, and when it was all over, they said I had to get out of New Jersey as soon as I was able to get out of bed. We went down to Florida for the winter of 1929 and I went to school there for just that wintertime. Then we came back, and that point, in 1930, we moved back to New York City, and then came down to visit my one grandmother who still had a house in Long Branch. I think the funniest story of all my three years in St. James was one time we were at the playground at the back of St. James, which was just dirt, and I fell down and really banged my head. In retrospect, I probably had a concussion because they sent me home or got my mother and she picked me up. The next day I came back to school and went into class and told the Sister I really couldn't see, everything was still blurry. She said "Don't worry about it, we'll put you in the front seat." That took care of it. That's the only help I got, but it worked. After about four or five days, I got my full sight back but I probably had a concussion. In those days, I don't think they knew a concussion from a bad cold.    Mr. Aumack: Did you tell your parents about it?    Mr. Moss: Well, my mother was there. You got to remember we're talking 1928, you know, and I was walking around...so what more do you want?    Mr. Aumack: There doesn't seem to be any long-term effect, so...    Mr. Moss: So, that was my most interesting bit about St. James. As far as a little bit about New York. I went to a public school in New York. We moved from Amsterdam Avenue to Riverside Drive, and then we finally ended up about twelve years on Park Avenue. When I graduated from public school, I went to Horace Mann School, which was a private prep school at 246th Street. In fact, I'm very proud of my diploma from Horace Mann School, because in those days, it said Horace Mann School for Boys, Columbia University. But it's no longer part of Columbia University.    Mr. Aumack: Prestigious!    Mr. Moss: Yes. It is very prestigious. You have to be brilliant to get through it now. I mean I barely got through it, but what I enjoyed most about it was the study hall periods when you could go to the library. I read every book of fiction in my four years. I started with the As and read every bit of fiction. I felt you could learn more from a good author because he has done his research, and I particularly liked historical novels like medieval and this and that. The point is that if there was a lot of fighting in a particular one, let's say Elizabethan times, you knew the author did his research because he had all the different kind of swords and knives and daggers. Or if there was a lot of eating going on in another venue, there was a lot of detail about what was served in the tavern. I learned more from good fiction than I think learning about the Civil War and who discovered the Mississippi River. Growing up in school, we had chapters on the Revolution, chapters on the Civil War, chapters on World War I and now you look at a history book, what is it? Half a page. You had to know every battle of the Civil War, every battle, so things are condensing. They are important facts, of course, but on the other hand I felt I learned more about history in general from fiction.    Mr. Aumack: It seems that you learned more by teaching yourself.    Mr. Moss: Yes, sure.    Mr. Aumack: Interesting. So, after Horace Mann School, did you go to college?    Mr. Moss: Yes, the University of North Carolina.    Mr. Aumack: And you graduated after four years?    Mr. Moss: No way. Uncle Sam stepped in. I was about to be drafted, so I decided to enlist because if you enlisted, you could select the branch of the Service that you wanted. I wanted the Signal Corps, playing it pretty brilliantly that the only two Signal Corps camps were Fort Monmouth and one in California, and I'd never been out west. Obviously, I ended up in Texas. So I enlisted just to pursue that. While I was down in Texas, the outfit I was with was a Signal Operations Battalion. There was an officer that came down from Washington D.C. from the Office of Strategic Services, the OSS, and they had looked over the records in the Signal Operations Battalion. I think everyone in the Battalion had an IQ of 150 or more, and they were putting this battalion together to service a headquarters. It would be the communication branch of an Army headquarters. So they put it together, I think, depending on the minimum IQ of 150. On that basis, with a relatively high IQ as far the average Army was concerned, our group was checked out and I think there were three of us asked to report. We were given an outline on to see if we met the requirements. You had to volunteer for the OSS. Are you familiar with what the OSS is?    Mr. Aumack: No, please tell me about it.    Mr. Moss: Well, I'm not going to tell you too much, but the OSS, Office of Strategic Services, was the espionage and counter-espionage part of the Federal Government. It was military, but you could be in the Navy, Coast Guard, Marines, or Army and still be in the OSS. You would work with the OSS and not with your own Army unit. So, I won't go into details, but I was chosen and was supposed to go behind the lines in France, but after we were given a week or ten days furlough before we went overseas, they said we were lucky because we would be the first ones they were going to give a pre-jump physical to. The only pre-jump physical we had and then part of our training, which was at the Congressional Country Club, in I think Maryland, was we would tumble out of the back of the pickup truck. That was what it was going to feel like when you land.    Mr. Aumack: Was this while the truck was moving?    Mr. Moss: Oh, yes. Not speeding, but it was moving. Oh sure, and I was going to jump out with about a thirty pound radio on my back. Believe me, a combat jump was a very short jump. You weren't up there 4,000 feet, you were pretty close. Anyway, they gave us a physical and said you can't jump because you had a cartilage removed from your knee. I said, "Yes, I injured it playing intramural football down in Carolina, and came up here on Christmas vacation and had to have it removed." They said, "You can't jump, forget it. You're off this particular team." So a couple of days later, I was calling the Office and they asked what I'd like to do, go overseas or stay in Washington, D.C. during the war.  I said I want to go overseas. So they asked where I wanted to go, and I said I didn't know. Just like at the movies...the Office had pressed the button and a curtain parted and there was a map of the world and there were blue buttons and red buttons. He said pick your first, second, and third choice of red buttons because they're headquarters, and you would get sent to the headquarters, but that doesn't mean you wouldn't be sent out on your own to do something. I said ok and started thinking: I had a chance to go any place in the world. I said my first choice is Chungking, China... I'll never get there. My second choice was New Delhi in India...I'll never get there. Then my third one, well, I really always wanted to be an archaeologist, so it was Cairo. Well the point is, I ended up in Cairo and I enjoyed that and then went from Cairo to Italy and just a month before the end of the war I ended up in the hospital with a very bad case of jaundice and hepatitis. I was a bed patient for about six months I think. I came home and eventually had a stay in a hospital in New York. And that brings us to basically to how I got started in Wall Street.    Mr. Aumack: Ok.    Mr. Moss: Well, it's kind of funny, because I had a resume, you know when you leave the army you have a resume of what you did, and they made it very general, but it said I taught cryptography. I did do this to agents that were going behind the lines in Greece. Cryptography was my specialty.    Mr. Aumack: Can you describe that?    Mr. Moss: Codes and ciphers.    Mr. Aumack: Was that by radio or written?    Mr. Moss: No. It's deciphering. You have a codebook, and by using the codebook, you could write a message in little groups of five letters, which are all garbled up. Unless you have a codebook at the other end, you can't break it down. You know what's at the bottom of a lot of crossword puzzles?    Mr. Aumack: Yes.    Mr. Moss: Alright. That's basically cryptography. It's encoded...I mean that's kind of easy because they just substitute letters. Looking at my resume, I hadn't gotten to any particular subject. I only had like the first couple of months of my sophomore year when I left Carolina. Because I had been ill, I had to be careful when I came back about what I could eat, so I wouldn't want to go down south again. I had spent almost three years in the military, so I figured what the heck, I didn't want to go back to college. I didn't know what I wanted to do, and I was a month or so in New York trying to figure who is going to look at my resume and say, "Oh, we've got a couple of agents and we need you to teach them cryptography." But it just so happened that a friend of the family was a member of the stock exchange and said, "Why don't you get a job down in Wall Street? Get a job with the Stock Exchange." So I went down there and got a job as a pageboy right on the floor of the Exchange, running messages back and forth. Then I moved up and was a recorder, who was the one who would record all the sales as they took place at a certain spot. And then there was an opportunity, if I could acquire a seat (really low in price), that I could become involved as a partner in a firm. So I did, and then I spent the next almost twenty years, I guess, in Wall Street. I was a specialist on the floor of the Exchange. Then I retired in 1971.    Mr. Aumack: When you first visited Monmouth County, describe it.    Mr. Moss: You mean in 1928?    Mr. Aumack: Yes, if you can remember.    Mr. Moss: I remember a couple of things. In Silver White Gardens, I had a cocker spaniel. His name was Abendigo, like in Shadrack, Meshack, and Abendigo. But any way, he was a nice pup, and he liked to be petted. So whenever he did anything nice, I'd pet him. Well, south of us it would be White Road. Do you know where White Road is? We were north of that, you know. Apparently there was a farm there that had chickens. Once a week our cocker spaniel would come up to me with a chicken in his mouth. He would not harm it, it wasn't hurt at all.    Mr. Aumack: It was still alive?    Mr. Moss: It was still alive. I'd pet him and I'd take the chicken out of his mouth. Well, I would return the chickens and that was my earliest recollection of the Red Bank/Sea Bright area. I remember falling down at St. James, and then the other thing is there were sidewalks all around in the development, which is Silver White Gardens. A friend of mine was Howard Alexander, who later became the editor of the Perth Amboy News. We each had a wagon and we used to put one knee in the wagon and one knee on the outside, where you would kind of pedal I guess, and we used to have a race all around on the sidewalks. There was nobody walking around there, you know, but that was the excitement of the day. It was Prohibition time, and I think the older members of various families would celebrate when they managed to get hold of a bottle of liquor somewhere. And so I remember that. That's going back pretty far in my memory. I do remember visiting my grandfather and grandmother's hotel. He had died in 1923, so I never knew him. She ran it until 1932. It was on Ocean Avenue in Long Branch. I remember going there a few times and I remember that when you walked in from Ocean Avenue, you walked across the big open hall and you would be facing a grand staircase that went up, turned around, and then went up to the second floor. I had a cousin who was five years older. I was six or seven years old, so he was eleven or twelve. We used to go into the kitchen, or go into the dining room, and each one of us would take one of these big trays that a waiter would carry and then we would toboggan down the grand staircase on these trays. Each of us would be sitting on a tray, and then we'd come down the long staircase. Well, my grandmother never said anything.    Mr. Aumack: And she saw you do it?    Mr. Moss: Oh, sure. Yes. So I remember that. I remember Ocean Avenue as a four-lane boulevard: two lanes north, two lanes south, with a concrete divider in the center. I remember going to the pier in late 1928, 1929 and 1930 and playing with penny arcade stuff that you would get prizes for. I remember going with my uncle one time, and there was one machine that if you won (I guess you'd put a penny in) you would get some perfume. I thought I'd like to bring some perfume back to my mother, and my uncle said ok. He put me in front of it and I got sprayed with perfume. But I also remember the greyhound races in Long Branch.    Mr. Aumack: Where were those held?    Mr. Moss: Basically the corner of Broadway and Ocean Avenue. There was a park there, and they also had midget auto races. I never did see the wrestling or boxing, but they had that there too. But I did see the automobiles and I did see the greyhound races. That was in the early 1930s.    Mr. Aumack: What was the population of Long Branch like?    Mr. Moss: Well, I think Long Branch, even Rumson up until after World War II, were summer communities to an extent. Yes, there were native people in Long Branch who lived there all year round. Almost two thirds of the houses that are there used to be rented out during the summer. A lot of them in West Park, Rumson were owned by the fishermen of Sea Bright. They had heat and all the winter conveniences in those houses. Then they would go back to Sea Bright where they had very simple, summer cottages with no heat and all of that. So, they would rent them. Well, to some degree there were a lot of homes that were just summer homes still in Long Branch, and of course there were hotels that were "modern", by that I mean there were none of them that were sixty or seventy years old. Some that were built around 1890 were still there, and it was a different kind of hotel life. It wasn't the Victorian day, you know. Take Sea Bright, for example...take the beaches, the beach clubs. I can remember in 1936, '37, '38, '39, the Chapel Beach Club used to be called Elliott's. It was owned a number of times. I worked there and it was "The Sea Bright Bathing Pavilion" owned by the Elliotts. Half of their bathhouses to the north were ones that were rented out for the season. The other half were for transients, because the transients came down from New York and came down right through Sea Bright, ok? If you go over the bridge now and cross Ocean Avenue, you would crash right into where the train station was. Of course, the trains ran parallel with the seawall. You know where Ocean Avenue is, then you've got that little space, and then you have the seawall. That little space is where the train tracks were. So the point is, they would be sold out on the weekend. People would come down just for the day, and for a dollar would get a bathhouse. They made an awful lot of their money on transients, people who came down for the weekend. Then of course you had hotels. You had the Peninsula House, up until it burned a number of years ago. The shore area bloomed in the summer time then, but now there are no hotels. Now there is no train. Now it's an all-year-round affair. The living conditions here are very few summer rentals. Everybody owns a house. All the bathhouses are rented out for the season. There are waiting lists for all these beach clubs. So it has changed...all these shore communities are all-year-round communities now rather than just summer communities. I don't know that much about the people in Long Branch, but I am sure a lot of the cottages closed up for the winter time. People could afford the homes and the hotels operated pretty much in the summer time. Some of them did stay open in the winter, but that wasn't the thing. It was a summer community.    Mr. Aumack: What did you like to do for fun in Monmouth County?    Mr. Moss: Go to the beach.    Mr. Aumack: Is this when you were a kid and an adult?    Mr. Moss: Oh, yes. I think when I was old enough to know what the ocean was and be careful of it, I was there from about nine or ten years old. We went to the same beach. My first job was raking the beach, and I remember Louise Norton who was one of the women who ran it. I saw her a number of years later and we were reminiscing. I said, "You know my first job was at the beach." She said she remembered. I said I used to get seventy-five cents a day! Well, you weren't working a whole day, you would work for an hour or two. She said, "Yes, I know, and you were paid too much."  But she was a good friend, you know. I grew up at the beach. It was funny, at The Sea Bright Bathing Pavilion, you always had the same spot on the beach. You would come down in the morning and even though there was nobody there, you always went to your same spot. Other people would come down, and they would go to their spot. It was funny that "the Rumson group" was off to the right of center and "the Red Bank group" was off to the left. Everybody had claims on the beach, and yet there was nothing official that said where you sat, but you just knew where your friends were going to be. They were going to be there, you know.    Mr. Aumack: What are some of your prominent memories of Monmouth County?    Mr. Moss: Well, some of the storms that we had of course were very impressive. I like the produce that you could get...the vegetables and fruit. You didn't grow it yourself, you just had to go inland a little bit where somebody had a farm, and the food was always good. I liked the climate. If you could survive New Jersey, you could survive anywhere, you know with all the humidity. But it never was like that...the weather is changing now. But the fact is, and you'll recognize this, where we are here we are very fortunate because when wind comes off the ocean, we're ten degrees cooler than Red Bank.    Mr. Aumack: That's true.    Mr. Moss: In the wintertime if the wind comes off the ocean, we're ten degrees warmer because the ocean doesn't freeze. So no matter how bitter cold it is, we're getting some heat from the ocean in the wintertime.    Mr. Aumack: So it seems like it has always been a desirable place to live.    Mr. Moss: Right. People were always friendly. Of course, I spent a number of years commuting in my later years. From 1953 through 1971 I was commuting, so I didn't spend too much time...well I wasn't here during the day obviously. But growing up it was fun. I remember when the circus would come to town.    Mr. Aumack: Which circus? Ringling Brothers or was it local?    Mr. Moss: Oh, no. It was a big circus. I mean we're talking quite some time. It was one at Monmouth Beach. It wasn't Ringling Brothers but there was one at Monmouth Beach. Then there was one in Middletown I think that might have been another circus besides Ringling Brothers, but I can't remember the name. There were things like that, and the King and Queen of England came down Rumson Road.    Mr. Aumack: Oh! Tell me about that.    Mr. Moss: Well, they came down here in 1939. They came from Washington to Red Bank by train and then took a car, came down Rumson Road, made a left turn, went out to Sandy Hook, got on a destroyer, and then made a triumphant entrance into New York. I took a photograph of them as they went by, and at St. George's Episcopal Church by the River they had the whole choir and everything getting ready to sing when they came by, and I don't think they got more than one note out and then "phew" they went by. They had everybody up on Rumson Road, and you know they couldn't stop. Zoom. They went right by. That was unfortunate, but that was probably one of the most important motorcades that came through here, although some of the later presidents have driven through here.    Mr. Aumack: What king passed...was that King George VI? Take your time. So, we're looking at a picture now, a blurred photograph of a car...    Mr. Moss: Of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth.    Mr. Aumack: Wow! And they didn't even stop.    Mr. Moss: No, they didn't stop. And this was a little flyer that St. George's put out. They were going to sing this and have a whole program.    Mr. Aumack: So, here they are...the choir is waiting to sing seven beautiful anthems, they are waiting for the car, they know the King and Queen are coming, and before they sing a note the car just zooms by without even hitting the brakes.    Mr. Moss: Right. And that is a state trooper there hanging on the running board. They had to get the King and Queen out...they couldn't take a chance, you know. I mean that was I think kind of interesting...June 10th.    Mr. Aumack: June 10, 1939 they passed?    Mr. Moss: Yes.    Mr. Aumack: Do you know why they came to New York? They came to Red Bank because it was a way to get to New York or....    Mr. Moss: Well, it was the easiest way for them to arrive in New York on a destroyer. They wanted to give them all the prestigious arrival as they could have. Instead of getting on a destroyer down in Washington, they could get up here and it's only a half-hour run to New York. But meanwhile, they would come in on a destroyer and look like the King and Queen of England.    Mr. Aumack: Now, I see the state trooper in the picture. Was there one on each side of the car? Or was there only one?    Mr. Moss: Well, I only saw one side of the car. I'm assuming there was just one.    Mr. Aumack: Is that the only protection that they had?    Mr. Moss: Oh, no. They had motorcycles, too.    Mr. Aumack: Did Wilson ever visit Monmouth County?    Mr. Moss: He was in Long Branch.    Mr. Aumack:  What was he doing there?    Mr. Moss: He was the governor. He actually, in the original building that was on the original site of what is now Monmouth University, made his acceptance speech to run for President. There is a very famous photograph of him there. Yes, Wilson was here.  I don't get into politics and people.  I have written a book called Steamboat to the Shore which is the steamboat history of Monmouth County.  I have a tremendous list of steamboats that ran from 1848 on up in the Bay Shore, Long Branch and others, but the one thing I don't put in the book is the names of the captains. You are bound to leave some of them out, and then the family comes around saying, "Why didn't you put my grandfather in?" And it's tremendous research. I'm not saying it shouldn't be done, but I don't do that. It's the same way with houses. I don't keep a record of who owned what house or really what families were here ninety or one hundred years ago. It's just too much. No matter how much you put in, you're going to leave some of them out.    Mr. Aumack: You mentioned that you commuted in to New York City from 1953 to 1971 because you worked on the Stock Exchange. Please discuss the transportation that was available.    Mr. Moss: Well, I'd have to drive from Rumson to the parking lot in the Red Bank Station. I'd get on a train. When I became a member of the Exchange, I didn't have to go in quite as early. But regardless of what train I took, an earlier one or let's say an 8:00 a.m. one, you would take it and then transfer off the train and take the ferry across to Lower Manhattan. There was a Central Railroad ferry. It would leave you off on the west side of Manhattan in the vicinity of where the World Trade Center is now. You would just walk up the street to Broadway and walk down a couple of blocks and then you were there. And you'd just reverse that in the afternoon. It was kind of fun because you'd walk past a few interesting stores, although you didn't have too much time because you always wanted to catch a train, you know. I got to be friendly, to the extent that he would talk to me, with the captain of one of the ferryboats. I don't know his name. I heard him blast the horn a few times and asked, "What are you doing that for?" He actually let me ride up in the captain's cabin. He said, "Whenever a big steamer goes out, the Queen Mary or whatever, we always salute them." I said, "Oh, my folks are going to Europe Saturday." He asked what ship and I told him. He said "Ok, tell them to be on deck and I'll salute them." And sure enough, my folks were going with another couple and my father said, "When we get opposite the ferry route, let's see what happens because then the big boat salutes back." So sure enough, as the Queen Elizabeth was passing the ferryboat, which was in midstream, the ferryboat saluted and the Queen Elizabeth saluted back. And you know what was interesting about the ferry? If you were up in the wheel house of the ferry, you can't see the bow of your boat. If you were up where the captain was, you couldn't see it. I asked why he didn't crash into the dock, and he said he went in and sort of hit it sideways. If this is the width of the slip, instead of going straight in, you go this way.    Mr. Aumack: So he brings the boat in on a slant.    Mr. Moss: Very slowly and lets it sort of bounce off the side a little bit. I think that was always interesting: you know, he can't see where he is going.    Mr. Aumack: When did you involve yourself with the history of Monmouth County?    Mr. Moss: I would say around 1938, 1939.    Mr. Aumack: Why did you get into it?    Mr. Moss: Well, because the family always had an interest down here. My two uncles and my father used to play on a local baseball team. My grandfather was involved in the hotel business, and his brother was also involved in the hotel business in Sea Bright. I got involved because my grandmother had a scrapbook and my great-grandmother had a scrapbook. There were things in my grandmother's library, like in the Long Branch Daily Record the day World War I was over in 1918. I would collect that stuff, and there were things that they had that related to the area, like a menu or something. And then I got involved in images of the area, woodcuts and engravings, from Harper's Weekly and Frank Leslie's Magazine, which makes for all the illustrations I use in my books.  And here's an old newspaper...this is the worst storm that ever hit Sea Bright.    Mr. Aumack: So in your opinion this is the worst storm that ever hit Sea Bright? Ever?    Mr. Moss: About ten years before my life.    Mr. Aumack: One of the greatest was on December 26, 1913 and the other one was on January 3, 4 and 5, 1914. Do you recall if there were any deaths?    Mr. Moss: I don't think there were any deaths, but you're talking about a loss of half a million dollars. If you convert that into current currency, it's over ten million dollars.  The point is, the houses were smaller, and there was the Octagon Hotel that was wiped out. The ocean is in back of that. Then this finally burned. Then of course there's the '92 storm that we had...    Mr. Aumack: The Nor'easter? In your studies, do you think it even compared to the storms that we discussed in 1914?    Mr. Moss: No. I think there was more damage really in the town in 1914.    Mr. Aumack: Tell me what you think is important regarding family, and you living in Monmouth County.    Mr. Moss: I think what's important about a family is that it sticks together. A family has conversations with one another and supports one another. I think the educational facilities in Monmouth County are excellent, and you have your choice of where you can send your children. I think that's important. I just think it's a great place to grow up in for a simple reason: like I enjoyed it, children still like the beach. Now they like other things like hockey, and there's a lot more on-going sports and schools are making available more facilities for the children. And I think the climate is good, too. I think that's important.    Mr. Aumack: What else is great about Monmouth County in your opinion?    Mr. Moss: In many places, Monmouth County has kept its beauty by restricting, to some degree, the amount of building that's going on. Now we're at a point where there are legal battles about whether we can retain certain areas for farmland.  I don't know the statistics, but New Jersey was always called The Garden State because it had a high percentage of farmland. Well, that farmland is disappearing. You drive from here out to Freehold and you can see what's there. There are nice homes, but no farmland. I think certain towns have had to be very protective of what they have because they don't want it to change. I think Rumson certainly is one. It hasn't changed that much. You still can go down Rumson Road and you've got a tremendous view of very nice homes and the trees are still there. You know, for every tree that's taken down, we put another one back up in Rumson. We do have legal restrictions on what you can do in Rumson. Spring Lake is a beautiful town, too, with beautiful homes. There has to be a place for commercialism, but it doesn't have to be, for example, in Spring Lake in the midst of a residential section. I think that's it. A lot of towns have done their best to keep the beauty of what Monmouth County has always had. And that's what Henry Hudson said: this is a pleasant land to fall to, or pleasant land to see. When he first saw it, it was a great spot.    Mr. Aumack: So you're talking about when Henry Hudson first came here as an explorer? And that's how he described it?    Mr. Moss: Yes.    Mr. Aumack: Is it still a pleasant land to see?    Mr. Moss: Well, you have to compare it to something.    Mr. Aumack: That's true. What will change, in your opinion, in Monmouth County that hasn't already?    Mr. Moss: Change is always happening. Change is an ongoing thing. Some of the changes will continue to expand. I do think one of the biggest battles will be to control the population. Now I don't say we should control it, but I'm saying if all of the open land, all the park system, and the acreage which is still forest, if that isn't kept, and all of a sudden becomes a development with a hundred houses in it, then you'll have to eventually build a larger school or build a new one. You'd bring more stores in, etc. So gradually you would lose the suburban feeling, the country atmosphere. When you live in the city, you want to go down into the country. When you come down here and hit some of the towns, you don't think you're in the country, you think you're in the city. So I think Monmouth County should try to retain its historic background of being a beautiful country area or a seaside area. There's nothing wrong with Miami, but how would you like Long Branch and Asbury Park to develop into a double row of high-rise condos by the ocean? It could happen. It has happened on a very small scale. But what made these seaside towns successful is tourism. You don't have tourism in Sea Bright anymore. There's not a hotel where you can stay. At one time, there were seven hotels. There's no place to stay in Monmouth Beach. There's only one place to stay in Long Branch...that's the one that used to be the Hilton. There are some condos that are there for all year-round residents, but tourism was what kept all these towns going. Now that's not to say that Sea Bright doesn't overflow on the weekend, because there are people coming down that go to the Hook, and then they'll drive down, you know. There's a lot of out-of-towners, but at the same time, what keeps the town going now is all the restaurants and the all-year-round people. Sea Bright's population has increased so much although I can't give you exact figures. It used to drop twenty-five percent in the wintertime. But then in the summertime, the fishermen could rent their small Rumson houses and they would go there, and the hotels were there, and the population would build up. Again, I think the main thing that has changed in the area is the lack of tourism, which is because the trains are not here anymore.    Mr. Aumack: Can you pinpoint the time when the Jersey shore went from a tourism area to an area of permanent residence?    Mr. Moss: Yes. Right after World War II.    Mr. Aumack: Why?    Mr. Moss: Number one, the trains were discontinued.    Mr. Aumack: Do you know why?    Mr. Moss: Yes. There was a storm in 1944 and it ruined the tracks. Central Railroad didn't want to put them back, but the storm also eliminated the boats that used to go back and forth. There used to be Central Railroad steamers that you could get at Atlantic Highlands. Well, they weren't running anymore, obviously, because how do you get there if the trains don't run? That was one thing. The other thing about post World War II era is related to the World War I song called, "How You Gonna Keep 'Em Down On The Farm After They've Seen Paree?"  In 1938-1941, there were high school students who were going to Rumson and Fair Haven who had never been to New York City. Once they went overseas, once they saw there was another world, then people started to move around. People also did not want to go for the jobs of service-type of jobs in the area. A lot of people didn't want to be a chauffeur or gardener or similar things for an estate anymore. So a lot of the estates closed down, too, because the older generation had the money and left the estates to the children. None of the children could afford a big home, so it was sold. A lot of them, certainly some of them, were torn down. If somebody had twenty acres, they sold it so five or six houses, much smaller houses, could go up. So World War II changed Monmouth County. And what definitely changed tourism was the lack of quick, inexpensive transportation to the shore.    Mr. Aumack: Describe how a New Yorker could get down here before that storm in 1944.    Mr. Moss: Well, he could take the Pennsylvania Train, but that would bring him to Red Bank and Long Branch. He could take the Fulton Street Ferry across the Jersey and get on the Central Railroad of New Jersey Train. It would come down the Bay Shore area, down through Sea Bright, Monmouth Beach, and at Long Branch would hook up to the Standard Railroad Track and would go down as far as Bay Head. But even if the trains were running at the moment, there is now no place where somebody could spend the night. After 1942, more people had automobiles and consequently they drove to Pennsylvania, New England, and the Carolinas by car. That made more of an adventure. Back in 1857, how do you think the people got to the hotels in Long Branch? They took a boat from New York. Sandy Hook was an island, and where that inlet was, the boat would come in and just about where the Twin Lights are, on the Sea Bright side, there was a very small little hotel called The Ocean House. It had a dock, and the people would get off that boat, get to the dock, and get on some carriages and go to Long Branch by carriage. The boat would come this way, and right across the river was this dock. This is Sea Bright, which is a barrier beach with nothing on it. The ocean is here and the river is here. You would need these wide-wheeled carriages to carry the people down to Long Branch. So it was an adventure! It would take you a few hours, but you had a trip on the ocean and the river and a wagon. It was all an adventure!    Mr. Aumack: With so much history being torn down, how can citizens of Monmouth County better preserve their history?    Mr. Moss: Well, we have something like that going on right now in Rumson. There's a house whose property goes back to 1665, and the house was built maybe around 1720. A person has bought it, with the property, and he wants to tear the house down and put up four houses on the property. It has been a big hassle over at the planning board. They've got over 600-700 signatures in favor of keeping the property as it is, and it is still going back and forth. How do you do it? Well, legally, if this fellow fights and fights it, and the opposition can't get any support from the government/county or whatever, he has the right to tear it down and that's it.    Mr. Aumack: So it may not matter how many signatures there are, if he wants to do it, he can do it?    Mr. Moss: If it's just a lot of people saying "keep it," then that's not enough. But it's very possible that if whatever is going to be destroyed is significant enough, that it's on a historic preservation list or something like that, that would make a difference.    Mr. Aumack: What do you want to say to future generations and people that live in the next millennium? What do you want to tell them...any advice you want to give to young people? Is there anything that you want to say?    Mr. Moss: The only basic link with history I think the next generation will have, and for that matter almost this generation, is our books. The Arcadia local history books have come out. I don't know if you know them...they're small books...but they've contacted individuals in a number of towns to see if they'd write a little history of the town. And that has created quite an interest in local history, but the only link that they are going to have with history is by reading more in depth about it. The only other thing I would say is that anybody who would think it interesting to photograph special events like a storm, a fire, or an older house should do it! Photograph your own town! I have been taking pictures since 1939, and they are pretty important pictures at this stage of the game. My book is based on a collection of five thousand glass negatives I acquired from a major photographer, and they are all Monmouth County between 1898 and 1914. So that's why you can see some spectacular photographs of what was going on then.    Mr. Aumack: What was the photographer's name?    Mr. Moss: Gustav Pach. His chief photographer was George W. Morris, and I got these from Morris's son. If you want to see how another generation lived, see these pictures. That's why photographs, even photographs in 1930 and 1940, would mean a lot. Here's the Twin Lights. There's an airplane flying over Asbury Park...this is George Gould, a financier. His home is now a college in Lakewood. This is the inside of it when it was his house...he's having a little costume party. If you look at a photograph, the average person would say, "Wow, there's a lot of vegetables there or fruit." Go over that with a magnifying glass, and you would be amazed at how many different kinds of vegetables and fruit you can identify...or the inside of a store. That's why I think a photograph, which includes the woodcuts and engravings, is a document from the past. You can see all the different kind of foods that were for sale, the date on the champagne, etc. I would say a person should document their town...just a few pictures a year or if something was coming up that was going to change it. In fact today they are putting up a cellular tower that is going to be 155 feet tall. Well they've got 50 feet of it up already, and I'm going to take a picture of that 50 feet and then 75 feet. Everyone can be their own historian, it's just whatever they like. Somebody might just like to photograph boats, or beaches, or trees in bloom, or gardens or whatever. That's the only way they are going to keep history. They are historians if they go out and do something.    Mr. Aumack: What have you enjoyed most about Monmouth County...living here and visiting here all throughout the years? Go into as much detail as needed.    Mr. Moss: Well, I think the area itself...the location...what it has to offer like the beaches, farms, food, and the people. I think it's very, very friendly, even though I know there's some animosity between towns. There are problems with Monmouth County, and the problems are going to get worse if you read the local papers about how the seacoast is going to erode and all the damage that's going to happen there in the next few years. That could happen, and it probably will. We could lose the beaches and the seashore houses.    Mr. Aumack: What would you do for fun when you were ten or twelve years old?    Mr. Moss:  I would go to a movie for fifteen cents in Red Bank on a Saturday afternoon and see Tom Mix, cowboy. You'd see a serial, a new chapter in a serial each week. You'd see the main picture, but you'd also always see a chapter of Tom Mix. Then we'd go to a drugstore next door and get a banana split for ten cents. Here is my classic story on how things have changed. Growing up in the city, I always managed to try and end up with at least fifty cents by Saturday, ok? I think I got a dollar a week allowance and I had to shine my father's shoes to earn it. I think I used to sell him cigarettes. I'd buy a carton. A carton used to cost maybe twenty cents a pack in those days, in 1937, 1938, 1939. And I used to sell them to him for twenty-five cents. It cost me twenty cents and he'd buy them from me for twenty-five. Saturday would roll around and I'd meet a buddy of mine, and I had fifty cents in my pocket. I'd spend a nickel on the subway. I lived on 88th and Park, and I'd end up downtown. I'd go to a place near Nedicks, which is place noted for orangeade and hotdogs. Everybody would say they were going to the orange room of Nedicks. So for a nickel you got a hotdog, and for a nickel you got a tall orange juice. There's fifteen cents. I'd put another nickel aside so I could get home...there's twenty cents. I'd have thirty cents left. I'd go to Woolworth Five & Ten and buy a quarter pound of chocolate-covered raisins for a nickel because I wanted something to munch on at  the movies. I'd go to the Paramount. Before one o'clock, it was twenty-five cents. You saw the coming attractions, Fox Movietone news, a cartoon, and then another little movie, a short they called it. Then you'd see the main movie, the feature. What you also saw was Tommy Dorsey and his band, Frank Sinatra, the vocalist, or whatever as the live stage presentation. You had a show.    Mr. Aumack: So you saw Frank Sinatra live...while there was a movie?    Mr. Moss: No. You'd have a stage show. Then when it was all over, that's when you would see the news, cartoons and the movie. It would start off with a presentation of a major bank and a few little acts, almost like vaudeville. The point is, you would stay after the movie was over because then you would sit through the live show again. And it only cost twenty-five cents. So I still had a nickel to come home. And that was fifty cents. With fifty cents you can barely make a phone call now! In a way, times are different. I think somebody said, "Times are a'changin."  I remember when I was in high school, I would double-date with a buddy of mine. I lived down on 88th Street and he was up on 201st Street. I'd take the subway up because we knew two girls up there. I guess we were eighteen because at that point he could drive, so we drove somewhere like the Log Cabin Casino or places like that. I usually would get back from 201st Street on the subway -- although at that point it was above ground -- at maybe two o'clock in the morning. I can wake up without an alarm clock. If I had to wake up at 3:15 a.m. tomorrow I could do that without an alarm clock. So I'd get on the subway with nobody on the train. I'd lie down on the seat at  two o'clock in the morning, go to sleep and wake up in time to get off at 96th Street and Broadway. Then I'd change to the local, which would let me off at 86th Street, and then take a bus across town to the apartment. The point is, there were no problems in those days. You could lie down in the subway and nobody would bother you. So things have changed, and I think things are obviously changing down here too. There's no doubt about that. But that's history.    Mr. Aumack: Is there anything else that you want to add before we stop?    Mr. Moss: No. I just want to say I thank you for the opportunity of allowing me to make a few comments. The thing that has motivated me most is the fact that I have been a collector of a lot of memorabilia, pictorial history, and ephemera for many years. It's fine to collect it all, but I wanted to share it. That's one of the reasons I put my collections between book covers. The pictures are there and the ephemera is there. The research is quoting the original articles. I don't write history, as I've said before. I edit it. I wasn't there when George Washington had the Battle of Monmouth, so I don't write what the battle was about. I'll go to the original documents that exist, diaries, and whatever, put them all together and with a little editorial writing connect the quoted material. And nothing says more about a subject than a photograph or an illustration. There might be a caption or a little paragraph describing what was going on, but it's the pictures that say the words. I enjoy doing that and really what I enjoy most of all is that I can share it with people. You can have the world's biggest collection of anything, but if people don't see it, what good is it? You'd go nuts if you owned all the Picassos in the world  but when you open the door and say, "Take a look at all my Picassos," it makes sense. So I'm happy that I'm able to share what I've put together over sixty years between book covers. I hope someone else will carry the torch, although not close to the paper stuff!     Mr. Aumack: One more thing I'd like to ask you about.  What were some other prices?    Mr. Moss:  What were prices in those days? Well roast beef might have been twelve cents a pound, bananas could have been six cents a pound. Look at what an automobile costs! I bought my first automobile in 1946 I think. It was a Nash Rambler. It was a convertible and cost $1935. Now you can just about get a set of tires for that.     Mr. Aumack: Was that price looked upon as being affordable or was it looked upon as a very expensive automobile?    Mr. Moss: No, it was affordable. It wasn't the lowest one and wasn't the highest one. There was a lot more selling for $8,000 - $10,000. I don't know what a Rolls cost then, but of course it was very expensive. The point is you got a darn good car for $1935. Just like when Model A Fords were around. You could get those for $500-$600.    Mr. Aumack: Were those affordable?    Mr. Moss: Oh sure. Ford said he wanted to make cars for the masses with the assembly line production and all that. He'd paint it any color, as long as it was black. His cars were very inexpensive and sold like hotcakes. When somebody could afford $500-$600, they bought a car. Now you go out and I hate to think what a new car costs.     Mr. Aumack: One more thing. I want to talk about the people. Have they changed or stayed the same?    Mr. Moss: Yes and no. I have to speak for Rumson, but I think it's the same all over. People will stay here for a number of years and then move on for various reasons. Historically, I think most people used to spend the majority of their whole life in one town. Now drive along Rumson Road or anyplace in Fair Haven and see all the For Sale signs. They are continuous because there is always somebody moving out and somebody moving in. So the people change and it's only the people who have been here for some time who have the feeling for the town. Somebody might come in from Syracuse or Birmingham, Alabama and if they see one little thing wrong, they'll go in and raise heck. We explain to them that we don't pick up garbage on Wednesday, and if you read the little bulletin you get every month, then you'd know you're supposed to put your garbage out on Tuesday. You get a lot of criticism, but it's from people who don't understand what's going on. The people who have been here a long time understand what's going on, and a generation ago there were more people like that people living here. I don't say you have to spend your whole life in a town. I've spent plenty of my life in New York, but I wouldn't want to go back to New York. In fact, I haven't been back to The Stock Exchange in twenty-some years. And I spent twenty-some years there. Rumson is a friendly town  you can talk to people and you know people. But, things are changing. Everything is changing: our morals, our politics, the way business is done, and hey, you don't even use tape recorders anymore.    Mr. Aumack: That's right, we're using minidiscs today.    Mr. Moss: That's progress. In many instances it is progress and then in other instances it is not progress. I think the answer to your initial question is both yes and no. People are the same, and people are not the same. But I think there is more change going on, obviously. There's more change going on in the year 2000 than there has been in the last ten years.    Mr. Aumack: Interesting. I think that's a good place to stop. Mr. Moss, I thank you very much. It's been an honor.    Mr. Moss: Mr. Moss was my father. I'm George.    Mr. Aumack: All right, George. Thank you very much. It's been an honor.
MonmouthCounty;George Jones;1923;1999;George Jones, 1923, 1999    Remembering The 20th Century:  An Oral History of Monmouth County  JonesGeorge.jpg (8733 bytes) Mr. George Jones Date of Interview: September 8, 1999 Name of Interviewer: Flora Higgins Premises of Interview: Eastern Branch of the Monmouth County Library, Shrewsbury, NJ Birthdate of Subject: November 13, 1923 Deceased: January 30, 2001  Ms. Higgins: Can you tell us something about the way Red Bank looked, and what it was like growing up in Red Bank?  Mr. Jones: Red Bank was a very small town. We knew most of the people in town when we walked down Broad Street, which was a main commercial street in town. You'd recognize about seventy to eighty percent of the people. It got a little busy in the summertime because Route 35 was the main access to the shore area, but we had no other traffic jams coming down from the New York and Metropolitan area.  Ms. Higgins: Before those supermarkets came to the area where did people in Red Bank do their grocery shopping?  Mr. Jones: Well, we had several independent grocery stores, and I may add, it was much more convenient than the supermarkets are today. Mother would get on the telephone and call Mr. Davidson and order her groceries for the week, and he would have them delivered within a couple of hours.  Ms. Higgins: That was a wonderful convenience. It beats pushing those carts through the parking lot. Also, Red Bank is known for having a lot of small retail stores. How many of those were there when you were growing up?  Mr. Jones: Not too many. There are not too many left. I guess Prown's is probably the one I remember most because if you needed anything, you could buy it at Prown's.  Miller's Shoe Store is the oldest in existence dating back to 1865.  John B. Allen Shoe amalgamated with Miller's in the 1940s.  Ms. Higgins: To this day, if you need that little gadget, you can find it at Prown's.  And Natelsons, of course, has come and gone.  Mr. Jones: Well, before Natelsons, it was J. Kridel's, which was a good fashionable men's store, then Natelsons came along after that, on the same intersection of East Front Street and Broad Street.  Ms. Higgins: So, that's back with these family owned stores.  Mr. Jones: Mostly. I think we had a Woolworth's and a Leggett's Drug Store,  but other than that, they were all family owned businesses.  Ms. Higgins: Where was Leggett's?    Mr. Jones: There used to be a church on the corner of Broad and Monmouth Street, which would be the southwest corner, and the church was moved, and they had Leggett's Drug Store there. Now they have another building, called the Mini-Mall.  Ms. Higgins: The Mini-Mall has never been successful, has it?  Mr. Jones: Well, it's only because of a lack of parking space right on that busy intersection. Red Bank throughout the years, especially Mayor McKenna, has pushed very hard, and they do have good parking now on either side of Broad Street, a block or so in with the municipal parking lots.  Ms. Higgins: Well, still if you buy something substantial at the Mini-Mall, it's a hike to the car.   Mr. Jones: I've been over to the Monmouth Mall, and I can find a closer parking place in Red Bank than I can at Macy's, when you go down on a busy weekend.  Ms. Higgins: That's right, because people have to walk to the stores. Red Bank has, however, seemed in general to have survived that.  Mr. Jones: It does have a good stable base. Places like Long Branch and Asbury Park, which were lovely in their day, have run through political situations, just like Jersey City has, and they went down hill.  Ms. Higgins: Everyone loves Red Bank. In fact, many people love Red Bank too much. Have you found it getting increasingly crowded and too upscale?  Mr. Jones: No, not at all. It has just advanced with the age. The youngsters, you know, they sort of enjoy it, and they do have good attractions for the children with the parks and things like that.  Ms. Higgins: The coffee shops are wonderful. It's a thriving town.  Mr. Jones: It is, although I can't see paying two dollars for a cup of coffee. (Laughs....)  Ms. Higgins:  I remember the days when the Count Basie Theatre was the Walter Reade Theatre.  Mr. Jones: The Walter Reade was the Carlton Theatre. We had another theatre in town at that time. The Strand Theatre, which was on the corner of Linden and Broad Street, where there is a financial institution at this time. Also, there was another theatre on Front Street, and the name escapes me, but that was in my very early years.  Ms. Higgins: Did you as a child go there on a Saturday afternoon?  Mr. Jones: Oh you had to, you had to go see Tom Mix and his cowboys and things like that. And, it was only twenty-five cents.  Most people could afford it.  Ms. Higgins: From Maple Avenue you'd walk down town.  Mr. Jones: Yes, we'd cut over to Broad Street and walk all the way down Broad Street.  Ms. Higgins: Was there a lot of beach traffic? There was probably no light.  Mr. Jones: There were lights dating back, I guess, quite a few years, but there was always as I recall a light at the corner of Maple and Monmouth Street. There were no traffic problems, just in the summer time.  Ms. Higgins: Red Bank has probably had good governments over the years to maintain that base and build on it.  Mr. Jones: I would think so. Regardless of which party was in power, the mayors were non paid positions, and they had a genuine interest in the welfare and the good of the people.  Ms. Higgins:  Wasn't Katherine White the first woman mayor?  Mr. Jones: Katherine Elkus White.  Her father was the ambassador to Russia. They had a large estate on top of Tower Hill, and she, I think, was known throughout the country, appearing later on in the later 1940s on TV Broadcast, as the first woman mayor in this country.  Ms. Higgins: Did you know her?  Mr. Jones: I didn't know her personally, but I knew of her.  Ms. Higgins: I wonder if you could talk also about the waterfront? What is your opinion on the various plans for developing the waterfront?  Mr. Jones: I think it is long overdue. Many years ago, they talked about access from Broad Street to the river, several small independently owned properties there, but they never did proceed. But, it is inevitable because it would add a lot to the downtown area.  Ms. Higgins: Do you remember swimming in the river?   Mr. Jones: Oh yes, but I am not a swimmer myself. There was more boating and fishing and crabbing. In the wintertime, they used to cut a hole in the ice and catch eels under the ice.  In the summertime, of course, the sailboats were very popular, and everyday, you'd see a whole bunch of them out there and races, and the river area was very, very active.  Ms. Higgins: The Monmouth Boat Club is an old and memorable institution.  Mr. Jones: Right. It is right down the hill from Broad Street.  I didn't spend too much time on the river.  I was more into baseball and tennis, myself. But the majority of the young people would be involved.  Ms. Higgins: Was there more ice boating in the old days when you were growing up?  Mr. Jones: Yes, there was, and I can't understand why. Whether the temperature has changed, but I do remember that there was quite a sport, and one year they had good ice there and they wanted to develop an area where they do a lot of skating because the ice was rough. So, they brought the borough truck down. It was a water truck they used to water the streets with because some streets weren't paved. And they brought the truck over on top of the ice, and low and behold, the truck went under right to the bottom! (Laughs...) We're talking the 1930s.   Ms. Higgins:  I remember it froze in the 1950s. I had my little son out on a sled behind me. I was skating, it was bumpy. One of these ice boaters were waving angrily at me. I later found out I was in the middle of the second heat of an international ice boating regatta.  Mr. Jones: Well, they had some big ones. Some of those iceboats were real big. They say that an iceboat can go faster than the wind speed.  Ms. Higgins: Back in the 1930s were they still cutting blocks of ice in the river?  Mr. Jones: Oh yes. Other people who had row boats or other places along the river would sell cokes or soft drinks. They'd cut the ice and then put them in a small enclosed area and put the ice in there and pack it with hay or straw and that ice would stay through the rest of the summer.  Ms. Higgins: Did you play baseball with your high school team?  Mr. Jones: Yes, I played for Red Bank Catholic High School three years. I wasn't a great baseball player.  Ms. Higgins: What teams did you play?  Mr. Jones: We'd play Red Bank. We'd play Long Branch. We'd play St. Mary's, Perth Amboy, and St. Peters, New Brunswick. We'd play Leonardo High School, which was the only high school in Middletown Township in those days.    Ms. Higgins: Did you have a form of Little League?  Mr. Jones: Well, Little Leagues hadn't really branched out in those days. At a later age they had the American Legion Baseball teams, where high school boys would play in the summertime.  Ms. Higgins: Did you play on those clay courts in Red Bank?  Mr. Jones: Well, I had my own tennis court.  My brother and I became interested in tennis, and there was an empty lot next to our house, and Pop said, "If you boys do the work, I'll provide the material."  So, he provided us with the cinder and the clay and had a gentleman who was knowledgeable of terrain and levels and things like that and set it up for us. My brother and I and our friends would cart the cinders, the base, and the clay and leveled it out and did all this and put a fence around it.  It took about two months. Then, we started to play tennis. That is how we became interested in tennis. Later on when I was in high school, I formed the first tennis team at Red Bank Catholic High School. We used to play some of our matches at the Red Bank courts.  Ms. Higgins: Did you ever go to those courts at Sea Bright?  Mr. Jones: Oh, yes, I was there. One thing about Sea Bright, it was so close by, you could see the best tennis players in the country because they had their annual tennis matches there just before Forest Hills.  We'd go down there and buy tennis balls because they'd only use them for a set or two. There was a little green from the grass on the tennis balls and we could buy them for a dollar for a tray, which was a good price in those days. But I was down there one time and it had rained the night before. Bobby Riggs, a well-known tennis player in those days, came on the court. He didn't like what he saw, so he went back and got a pair of shoes with spikes on them to go onto the main court. The officials of the Sea Bright Tennis Club said, "No, you're not going to play on our court with the spikes."  Ms. Higgins:  What other tennis greats did you see down there?  Mr. Jones:  I saw Alice Marble. And, when I was in Florida one time, I happened to be in a public court and I played against Don Budge and his partner, Gene Mako. Of course, Budge was internationally known. It just happened it was on a public court in West Palm Beach off Lake Worth. But it was interesting to me to play a person of that stature.  Ms. Higgins:  Was there any bootlegging that you were aware of that was going on in the area?  Mr. Jones: Well, just by word of mouth, of course. The reason for the bootlegging was alcohol was prohibited in those days.  A person could make a good living bringing liquor into the area, especially in the Bay Shore area all the way from Highlands to Atlantic Highlands, Leonardo. And, also it was reported that it used to come from the ocean down through Ocean Grove area. There were articles in the newspapers about the raids and things like that. Some of the people who were running the alcoholic beverages were known as mob leaders and things like that. But, I had no personal knowledge of it at that time.  Ms. Higgins: Was there any famous architect who worked on any of those buildings in Red Bank?  Mr. Jones: I am really not into architecture. They say there are some houses in Rumson that were designed by the famous Stanford White.  The architect for our high school, Red Bank Catholic High School, was Vincent Eck, and he also besides designed the Zobell Building, which name is changed, but it is on the corner of Harding Road and Broad Street on the southeast corner. And he also designed a lot of the churches in Monmouth and Ocean County. But famous architects, I wouldn't have that knowledge.  Ms. Higgins: Where is your favorite place for ice cream?  Mr. Jones: Oh, gosh, it used to be Hess's ice cream store at the end of Broad Street on Front Street. And it was all homemade, and it was great. And you could get a quart for a dollar, and everybody thought that was pretty expensive, but it was great ice cream.  Ms. Higgins: It seems like a lot, although I have cranked ice cream. (Laughs...) Another thing I wanted to ask you, was Ludwigs around then, or Sal's Tavern?  Mr. Jones: Ludwigs? Well Sal's of course. Mr. Viati got one of the first alcoholic beverage licenses in Red Bank and he was certainly around there in those days. Ludwigs did not open business until after World War II, maybe a few years after that. It was always a good place to stop in and have a sandwich. My favorite place in those days was Strand Restaurant, which is on Broad Street just down from Monmouth Street, and Mr. Noglow ran a wonderful establishment and all the waiters there were men in black suits. Not formal as such but pretty much the uniform was a good dressed suit. They had wonderful meals and then after the repeal of prohibition, they were allowed to sell alcoholic beverages. In those days, no one could stand at a bar on Broad Street. It was prohibited. So, if you ordered a drink it would be served by the waiter at your table.  Ms. Higgins: Did Red Bank Catholic have any particular rivalries with any of the towns?  Mr. Jones: Our main rivalry in that era was Red Bank High School, which was on Harding Road. And they always had a greater student population. Of course in those days, we didn't have any facilities for sporting events. We'd have to borrow the gymnasium at the River Street School for our basketball. We practiced in a deserted building on Riverside Avenue, which in the wintertime, we'd have a potbelly stove in the middle of the court and every time we had a break, we'd huddle around the stove to keep us warm.  And as I said, we didn't have a football team cause we were only paying ten cents a week for book rent and the parishioners couldn't afford the football and the uniforms and all that. And baseball, we'd go up to Newman Springs Road and there was a team that played there, a semi-professional team, the Red Bank Towners, and we were able to use that to practice baseball. Or we could use the Bergen Place Athletic Field, and the Red Bank Board of Education let us use that for some of our games.  Ms. Higgins: What happened to your tennis court eventually?   Mr. Jones:  Our tennis court was very active until the time of all us went into the service and there was nobody to maintain it. After my brother and I came back, we spent a couple of days getting it back into shape, but we were in the middle of returning to college and having to work. The weeds started coming in. My father maintained the integrity but not to put it in good condition, and the property was sold to a Dr. Hindle. He occupied 231 Maple Avenue as an office. My folks then moved over the Shrewsbury.  Ms. Higgins: Can you tell us something about your father and about your parents? How did they happen to come to Red Bank, or were they always there?  Mr. Jones: My mother was born and raised in Red Bank on Herbert Street. My father was born and raised in Vincentown, NJ, which is a very small rural farming community in Burlington County.  The Campbell's Soup Company had a lot of tomato fields there to help them with production of their tomato soup. Actually, Pop was a farm boy and then he went into WWI and served in the European theatre, and then he came back. Then he worked for the railroad and he was a station agent in Farmington, NJ.  After WWI, his sister had a date with a fellow by the name of Jim Hogan, and Hogan was later one of the editors of the Red Bank Register. So, my father came up with his sister.  My mother was a blind date and they took it from there and subsequently my father opened up the first gasoline station in Red Bank, which was on the corner of Bergen and Maple Avenue.  He opened up three other gas stations in all four corners in Red Bank.  During the second World War he had a tough time getting employees because they were always going up to North Jersey and working in the automobile plants. So, you're talking during the Depression. Making about fifteen dollars a week. Can you imagine how fifteen dollars can go? So, it was hard to get reliable employees, so he leased the stations he had to the various oil companies and... and took it from there.  Ms. Higgins: Entrepreneurship seems to have been the hallmark of Red Bank's development. I see it with the Seals and the Kolbys and Kislins.   Mr. Jones:  I remember the Kislins. I know Eddie Kislin. The son was in my period of time. You can still go to the second sub basement and you can find every kind of galoshes in the world.  Ms. Higgins: But now there seems to be a lot of what I can only call money management business in Red Bank. Is this a good thing?  Mr. Jones: Well, it certainly is a clean operation. They don't have to clean up after them. And it is attracting people from the surrounding areas who are interested in investments and things like that. I think it is very beneficial for this town. Who knows, if we have a deep depression, what will happen?  Ms. Higgins:  Would you like to talk about that railroad visit in Red Bank?  Mr. Jones:  I lived at 231 Maple Avenue and the King and Queen of England came in and stopped at the Red Bank Station. That evening, the train pulled in and the King and Queen in their Pullman car were about 200 yards from where I was sleeping. And then they pulled in and they had the official ceremony. There Charles English, the mayor, in his high hat and pinstriped trousers greeted them at the station. They proceeded to go out to Sandy Hook and there was a royal yacht moored there.  All the school children in town lined the streets in Red Bank.  All St. James students were lined up on Harding Road just right off Broad Street. They came by and waved and proceeded to Sandy Hook.  Ms. Higgins: What king and queen was that?   Mr. Jones:  King George and the Queen mother.  Ms. Higgins:  That must have been a lot of fun for you.  Mr. Jones:  It was interesting.  Ms. Higgins: When you went over to practice your sport, wasn't that on the west side of Red Bank?  Mr. Jones: If you divide the town by the railroad tracks, it was certainly on the west side. But now that developed area, you'd say probably in the area where the bowling alleys are now, the eastern end of Newman Springs Road. There were three baseball fields on Newman Springs Road. We had a team they called the Red Bank Pirates. Other days they called themselves the Bay Parkway Baseball Team. They were a professional team, very good baseball players. Then you had another ball field on the corner of Newman Springs and Shrewsbury Avenue. And there was the team called the Colored Giants used to play there. So, there was a lot more baseball played because, well, there was much more room and less expense. I mean you could go to a baseball game. A man would come around with a hat and get a donation and that is all it would amount to.  Ms. Higgins: I think minor league ball is trying to make a come back with the Trenton Thunders.  Mr. Jones: I think it is a great thing. I think as far as the youngsters are concerned, as far as the parents are concerned. Now if you go to New York to see the New York Yankees it is going to cost you a lot of money and if you drive, you've got to pay a fortune for a parking place. I haven't gone to a professional baseball game in years. I don't know why, but they say you can spend $200 to $300 on a ballgame, and it is out of the reach of the average person.  Ms. Higgins:  Has the west side of Red Bank always been an African-American community?  Mr. Jones: No, no. Basically it was an Irish community. Then, it was an Italian community. And now I would think it is predominantly Afro-American, but I remember some time ago, that a lot of the younger people could not afford houses on the east side of town and they revitalized, and have very nice residences there.  Ms. Higgins: So, you decided to go into the Air Force in World War II.  Mr. Jones: Right.  Ms. Higgins: In the Mediterranean Theater?  Mr. Jones: Well, that was the theater.  Called the Mediterranean Theater of Operations. I had completed a year and a half of college at Seton Hall in South Orange, NJ, and everybody was signing up for something or another. I told my mother I wanted to go into the Marine Corps and she was having apoplexy. Actually, it was a subterfuge because I wanted to go into the Air Force and I thought my mother would accept that.    Ms. Higgins:  Like most Americans, you probably put your college education on hold?  Mr. Jones: That's right. For three years or more, I put it on hold. I was interested in the practice of law, so I thought I would be better shape for that by going to a school that had a Law School. Seton Hall didn't have a law school at that time, so I went to Georgetown University in Washington, DC and got my Bachelor's degree there and went to Georgetown Law School afterwards. I was there about a year and a half. My father took ill, not terribly ill, but he wasn't able to perform his work, and so I took off from law school to help him for a year or so and then, I had an opportunity to go into the FBI. The FBI needed men to build up their complement because of the Korean War situation and I was accepted, one of the very few accepted. Before that it was mandatory you had to have a law or an accounting degree. But, there was a tremendous shortage of agents, so I was accepted and took it from there.  Ms. Higgins: I am particularly interested in this Communist Party investigation during the Nixon and McCarthy era.  Mr. Jones: Well, that was part of it, and certainly, but this was in a political area and you had people who said yes and nay. But as far as I am concerned, Mr. Hoover was one of the greatest dedicated American citizens, and he certainly did a great job. As far as McCarthy is concerned, I didn't necessarily agree with everything he did, the way he did it, but the people who he targeted were certainly a hell of a lot worse than he. Because if we had followed those people, we would be under the Soviet Rule now.  My first FBI office was in Butte, Montana. I went to training school at Quantico, because the FBI training school was there. And after going to the training school, I was assigned to the Butte, Montana office. It was quite an experience, although I had traveled a lot as a youngster with my folks or in the military service, I had never been in Montana, and it certainly was a great area, and I certainly enjoyed it very much. The people are just fine. You know it is a long way between gas stations there. If you go through a town, especially in the wintertime, if your tank wasn't filled, you'd be in trouble, because you could travel eighty to ninety miles without running into a filling station. But I enjoyed it. We had an unusual jurisdiction there because the FBI has the primary jurisdiction on Indian reservations. Things such as murder, rape, and so forth, which are normally crimes against the state, not against the federal government. But FBI has primary jurisdiction in Indian reservations. I thought the Indian people were just tremendous people. They did have one failing and I think it was biological. They could not handle alcohol. I remember July 1951, I was assigned to the Great Falls Montana Resident Agency which was a four man resident agency out of headquarters Butte.  I got a call in my hotel room there to go up to Browning, Montana which is the headquarters of the Black Foot Indian Reservation.  And I went up there, and they had these five or six men in jail, in the local jail, which is not as big as this room. And, they either had shot their wife, their mother, or their sister. That was all caused by their over indulgence in alcohol  and they just couldn't handle it. So, we had to go to interview each one independently and present this incident to the United States Attorney who had authorized prosecution in this manner. One interesting fact is when I did the background investigation on these men, each one of them were heroes in their own rights because they had been in WWII and had gotten all kinds of honors and commendations for heroism due to their service in the military during WWII.  Ms. Higgins: What happened to them?  Mr. Jones: Well, they went to jail.  Ms. Higgins: Indians are not United States citizens, are they?  Mr. Jones: Oh sure. Oh sure.  They are.  Ms. Higgins: What is their peculiar political status that makes them under the jurisdiction of the FBI?  Mr. Jones: Because the reservation is government property.   Ms. Higgins: It is becoming more and more of a concern to me that the Bureau of Indian Affairs is notoriously under funded.  Mr. Jones: They certainly are under funded, and I don't know how it evolved.  Many years ago when they established these reservations, the system of taking care of these people was an allotment or something  they'd have to get it at the reservation headquarters. Now, you had a lot of Indians 100 to 200 miles away and had to get on their pony and go in. They didn't have mail service or anything like that. Now if they sent their checks to them where they were, they'd still be hunting and fishing in the mountains. Now, to get their check on time, they'd go to the headquarters on the reservation.  That is the situation in Browning, Montana. They all get their checks, and they start drinking and they'd lose their check. But, the simple fact that they were drawn out of the mountains or out of their farms to pick up their largess or whatever you called it, it brought them into these towns and that caused moral decay.  Ms. Higgins: That's very interesting.  What you are implying is that with a simple way of delivering mail to them where they were working, on their farm and reservation, they might not have been so prone to alcohol in excess?  Mr. Jones: Right, absolutely.  Ms. Higgins: Makes sense. Then, I see you worked in Newark for a while.  Mr. Jones: Oh, I worked in Chicago, and after that from until 1955, I was transferred to the New York office, which is the largest FBI office in the country. In fact, when I was there, one fifth of the agent personnel world-wide was in the New York office. Of course, New York is a little different because it is a big port city. Also, it had the United Nations there when it was used as a recruiting ground by the Soviets and the KGB for gathering information regarding our military. Political, economic, the whole thing. These were in the Soviet legation in New York, which caused a drain of personnel there. And then I got to Newark just in time for the Newark riots.  Ms. Higgins: And then it seems back home to Red Bank.  Mr. Jones: Yes.  I had been working for it. There was a fellow who graduated from high school with me that came into the FBI about six months after I did. Spent time in one office. I guess he had some kind of a hardship and they brought him back to the Newark office and then Red Bank and in a couple of years. It took me from 1951 to 1970 to make it back to Red Bank.  Ms. Higgins: And along the way you married?  Mr. Jones: Yes, I married Jo-An Frances Layden, from Kenilworth, Illinois and we lived there until 1955 when I was transferred. There it was another big problem, when I was transferred back. We only had two and a half children and a lot of fellows in the New York office, lived in Stuyvesantown, a large apartment development near the office, which was a very desirable area for young people. But, if you have two kids and one on the way, it is not desirable because if you are on the fifteenth floor of this complex and one kid is healthy and the other has a cold, the wife can't be in two places at once. So, I had to make up my mind. Is it me, or is it my family?  So, I opted for the family. My folks were still living in Red Bank at the time. I bought a house on Arthur Place, which backs up to the house I used to live on Maple Avenue. But at least I took the 5:45 a.m. train in the morning and got back, if I was lucky, at 8:00 at night, but at least my children were in good shape, and my wife was in good shape.  Ms. Higgins: How many years did you commute like that?  Mr. Jones: I commuted from 1955 till I guess 1968 or so to New York, and then to Newark. When I got to Newark, I worked in Newark for a couple of years and finally came down to Red Bank.  Ms. Higgins: The Newark train station had a wonderful trolley car subway.  Mr. Jones: I never had the occasion to use one. Is that right?  Ms. Higgins: Up hill and down hill.  Mr. Jones: People didn't even know about it.  I understand they did some work on it recently, but to the extent of that I don't know.  I can remember in high school my mom and dad would get my brother Bill and me in the car and drive to Newark to buy clothing for the school year. Hahne's, Bambergers, Kresges.  Newark was a very large, modern clean city. And then, I guess because of WWII, it became rundown and the political situation destroyed it economically. It was a lovely city.  They have beautiful parks.  Ms. Higgins:  Did you ever consider political office yourself?  Mr. Jones: No,  I wouldn't like it. I think there are too many people trying to make money out of other people and it wouldn't be my bag, really.  Ms. Higgins:  What is your opinion on the controversy of the apartment complex they wanted to take down in Red Bank?    Mr. Jones: You're probably talking about the Rullman House. Dr. Rullman had a house on the river there.  Ms. Higgins:  Yes. Do you have an opinion on that?   Mr. Jones: Well, actually it is historical in that regard, not that anybody of any great importance lived there other than Dr. Rullman, who was one of the few first physicians in Red Bank. But, there was a need and I find it interesting that most of the people who were for preserving it lived in Rumson, Holmdel, Fair Haven, and Little Silver, but the people in Red Bank were for destroying it because it costs the taxpayers a lot of money, and there was loss of a good ratable.  Ms. Higgins: Did your children go to Red Bank Catholic as well?  Mr. Jones: Yes. I had four children. They all went to Red Bank at St. James Grammar School and Red Bank Catholic High School.  Ms. Higgins: A venerable institution in the area.  Mr. Jones: Oh, I would think so. Of course, the Church had been there before the turn of the century. My grandparents were parishioners there. And of course my mother went to St. James when it was a ten year school.  The St. James school later became a lumber yard. Right in the area where the Schwartz car dealership is.  But now they have changed it into a senior citizen's building. Well, my mother went to school there and graduated in 1908.  Ms. Higgins:  Are your children now in the area, making it a multi-generational?  Mr. Jones: No, my first was a boy and was named after me, and he is an instructor and teacher at Middletown North High School, and he lives in Red Bank on Arthur Place. My second was a girl, who has a special education background, and she is in charge of special education at a school district in Vermont. Then my third is a girl, Patricia, who is Vice-President of Cash Management for the State Street Bank in Boston, MA. And my fourth is a boy, who lives in Little Silver, and he is in the computer business. He recruits computer experts for the industry. They are all doing fine, thank the Lord.  Ms. Higgins: Can you tell us about The Morro Castle? What was it like to be a person going to see that?  Mr. Jones: Well, I was just a youngster at the time, and the radio broadcast alerted us to the beaching or the location of the Morro Castle after the fire right off of the pier in Asbury Park. So my father drove us down. And there was a continuing storm there in this area, for a couple of days. It was foggy and  we got out of our car and walked over to the Boardwalk. The Morro Castle was still ablaze and they had this Breeches Buoy there that was sort of a rope arrangement where they put a man in this seat and take him off of the boat and bring it into land. So it was a horrendous event. There were a lot of people with relatives there, and there was a lot of weeping and gnashing of teeth, what you would expect for such a traumatic thing. But I had no independent knowledge, although I later learned, that one of the personnel may have been responsible for it. But it was just such a crowd there, such anxiety and it was an international news item at the time, which occurred twelve miles from Red Bank.  Ms. Higgins: Did they take the survivors needing medical care to Riverview?  Mr. Jones: I think they may have taken some to other hospitals. There was Fitkin and Asbury. There was Long Branch Memorial Hospital and Riverview was the remaining hospital available at that time.  Ms. Higgins: I wanted to talk to you about FBI activity as recently as May. How did you help as a volunteer for that Operation Busy Signal?  Mr. Jones: As a volunteer. There was a friend of mine who is currently an F.B.I. agent who was deeply involved in this, and needed people who would be quasi-undercover status to elicit information from these people who tell us how we were going to make a million dollars. So, we were given recorders for our telephones and we got a call and they took it from there. And it is just based upon the false promises and enticements that these subjects were susceptible to and I don't know what this number is, but all throughout the country there were a lot of indictments.   Ms. Higgins: And the prosecution was able to proceed because of actions of people like yourself?  Mr. Jones: Right.  Many did testify in the trial. There have been many convictions, but I don't know what the status of it is because I'm not privy to the information.  I don't like people getting hurt, especially older people who have only their life savings. I think it is probably not as bad as murder, but the poor lady that is eighty years old and she is living on a pittance and somebody is trying to steal her money from her. I think that is the most despicable thing in the world.  Ms. Higgins: Is there anything you would like to have on record to address to future generations that will listen to and/or read this interview?  Mr. Jones: That's a pretty broad observation. I would think the most important thing is for the older people, the adults, to maintain a good, solid family, and to teach your children that morality does count in spite of what you may hear on television. Good family relationships, hard work - these are sort of looked down on these days, but this country has survived because of this, not because of the pop artists, the politicians that have gone bad, etc.  The emblem of the FBI is inscribed with Fidelity, Bravery, and Integrity.  This is not a mere motto, but a way of life which every one of us should follow.  I feel very fortunate having been raised in Red Bank and having parents who instilled in me a strong sense of morality and patriotism.  I feel very fortunate in being able to attend St. James Grammar School and Red Bank Catholic High School where I was able to obtain an excellent scholastic and religious education.  The highlights of my life are as follows:  1.)  Enlisting in the US Army Air Corps Aviation Cadet Program   2.)  Being accepted by Mr. John Edgar Hoover as a Special Agent of the FBI (1/29/51).  3.)  My marriage to Jo-An Frances Layden (8/9/52).    4.)  The births of our four children.     5.)  Being inducted into the Red Bank Catholic High School "Hall of Fame" at "Induction Ceremony & Dinner" held 4/30/99 at Navesink Country Club, Middletown, NJ.   Ms. Higgins:  Thank you very much for giving your time to this project and this interview.      
MonmouthCounty;G. Lester Whitfield;1922;2000;G. Lester Whitfield, 1922, 2000        Remembering The 20th Century: An Oral History of Monmouth County      G. Lester Whitfield  Date of Interview: January 21, 2000  Name of Interviewer: Flora Higgins  Premises of Interview: Eastern Branch, Monmouth County Library, Shrewsbury, NJ  Birth Date of Subject: April 22, 1922     Ms. Higgins: Lester, I'm so glad we could get together and talk today.    Mr. Whitfield: I'm glad to be here.    Ms. Higgins: How did you end up in Monmouth County? When did your family come, and what town were you born in?    Mr. Whitfield: I was born in my parent's house, in Eatontown, 192 Broad Street. The house is still in the family. My nephew now owns it. We sold it to him after my father died. And my father was born in Newark in 1895. My mother was born in West Orange in 1893, and my mom died in 1970. My father died in 1981.    Ms. Higgins: Tell us about your memories of growing up in Eatontown.    Mr. Whitfield: Well, I remember when I grew up in Eatontown, it was a very small town. In fact, the population decreased from the 1930 to the 1940 census, as I recall. I was growing up then, and I was interested in things like that. My dad was Vice President of the former First National Bank of Eatontown, which became part of Allenhurst National Bank then Central Jersey Bank, and when he retired he was Vice-President of Central Jersey Bank.    Ms. Higgins: You didn't follow the family into banking?    Mr. Whitfield: No. I can remember somebody talking to my father one time, and he said, "I suppose you are going to bring your son into the bank." My father said, "Over my dead body." But I was always interested in trains. My father, previous to moving to Eatontown, worked very briefly for Lehigh Valley Railroad. In fact, we didn't own a car until 1930, so we went everywhere by public transportation. We usually took the bus to Red Bank, or the train from Eatontown, or the train from Red Bank, and go to Newark to see my grandparents . My mom's parents lived in Newark. My grandfather Whitfield moved down to Eatontown in 1923, shortly after my parents. He was the first borough clerk when Eatontown became a borough from Eatontown Township. He served until 1938. He died in 1939. Andrew Becker succeeded him as borough clerk.    Ms. Higgins: Does the Whitfield Building in Red Bank have anything to do with your family?    Mr. Whitfield: Not that I know of.  Maybe eons back, you know, we're all cousins somehow or other.    Ms. Higgins: One of the things people keep recommending is improvements in transportation. Is it true you used to be able to get to Sandy Hook on a train or a trolley?    Mr. Whitfield: The trains came from Long Branch along the shores of Sea Bright and Monmouth Beach. They stopped at Highlands Beach Station, across the bridge at Highlands, and went up through Atlantic Highlands, and all the way to Matawan. That railroad was during the early years. The railroad had to maintain a line along the seawall. This was back in the days when they thought the railroads were rich and everybody else was poor. And the railroad asked for help to maintain the seawall of the North Beach, Sea Bright, and the Interstates. And they said, "No that's railroad property  you take care of it." So the railroad got washed out in a big storm in 1945 and was abandoned in December 1945. Interestingly enough, when they rebuilt the seawall, they put some track back to rebuild the wall. They've unloaded freight cars of stone right on the wall, without having to transport them by truck.    Ms. Higgins: Was the bridge there by Bahrs the old railroad bridge? When did that come out?    Mr. Whitfield: In 1949, when they closed down Fort Hancock, it was removed except for some pilings still there.    Ms. Higgins: Could you once get all the way out to Fort Hancock by train ?    Mr. Whitfield: Originally, the railroad ran out to a place called Horseshoe Cove. And when the Army made it the proving ground, the railroad built the track from Highland Beach to Atlantic Highlands in 1892. They moved the proving ground down to Aberdeen, Maryland some years later. They built a bridge across the Shrewsbury River from Highland Beach to Highlands and below the Scenic Drive to Atlantic Highlands.    Ms. Higgins: So Fort Hancock was the predecessor of Aberdeen?    Mr. Whitfield: Yes, it was the proving ground in Fort Hancock before Aberdeen, Maryland.    Ms. Higgins: When did Earle get into this picture?    Mr. Whitfield: Earle wasn't built until World War II. In fact, I was in the service by then. I went to work for the railroad in 1940. Then I worked for the railroad until 1944, and then I was inducted into the service, shipped to Shepherd Field, Texas. Here I'm in the Air Force and I wanted to work in the railroad. But that's another story.    Ms. Higgins: We'll get to that, too. But I can't envision these tracks running through Sea Bright  where were they?    Mr. Whitfield: Actually on the North Beach where that path is now. That was the railroad right-of-way. The Sea Bright station was where the highway bridge from Rumson is  they tore it down to build the bridge. Where the 7-Eleven is in downtown Sea Bright, where you have the diagonal, that was a grade crossing and the railroad went west of Ocean Avenue, down through Lowmoor, back of the Old Coast Guard Station at Galilee, where the railroad had a freight station there, and a telegraph operator there years before my time, and then Monmouth Beach came, and now, the present Ocean Boulevard, Atlantic Avenue from North Long Branch down to around Monmouth Medical Center is the right-of-way. When they took the tracks up is when they built a road there. It connected with the present North Jersey Coast Line at West End.     Ms. Higgins: Please tell us about the trolley.    Mr. Whitfield: The company was called the Jersey Central Traction. The late Judge Labrecque, who was a good friend of mine, just passed away in September. His father was a superintendent on that line, and that's how my friend got to Monmouth County. I used to tease him: I'd say, "I'm a native of Monmouth County and you're an immigrant." His father came to help build that trolley line that ran from Perth Amboy down to South Amboy, on its own bridge across the Raritan River, down through South Amboy and Sayreville, into Union Beach, Keansburg and Campbell's Junction at Belford. They had two lines from Campbell's Junction. One branch went to Red Bank, and it passed past what is now Middletown North High School, and came out roughly parallel to Route 35 to Red Bank.  And then the other line came down along Valley Drive and got to Atlantic Highlands.  Then it went on a piece of the old Central Railroad on the Stone Church Branch that they had leased, and passed Stone Church, and came up Valley Drive to Route 36 in the Highlands. It made a right turn at Portland Road, and then they terminated on the Portland Road section, up on top of the hill.  I have a picture of the people walking down the hill to get to walk across the bridge to the Highland Beach.    Ms. Higgins: What were the years for the trolley?    Mr. Whitfield: The Jersey Central Traction was abandoned in 1923.    Ms. Higgins: Why?    Mr. Whitfield: Well, everybody thought they needed automobiles. Nobody wanted to ride the trolley. Monmouth County was very sparsely populated. And the roads started to improve, and then of course everybody thinks of the car, I suppose. I don't know, I was just a baby then. I don't remember that. But the right-of-way was pretty well available and viewable until several years ago, when they started widening the roads. I can recall one time walking along and seeing the ties of the trolley tracks along Valley Drive up around close to where it comes out to Route 36 now. But they took that piece of right-of-way out when they built the present bridge and widened Route 36 in Highlands.    Ms. Higgins: I interviewed a lady from Union Beach whose mother used to take the trolley to work at the Eisner Factory in Red Bank.    Mr. Whitfield: Some of the cars had different schedules. Sometimes a car would go through at Campbell's Junction, change to go to the Highlands. Other times it would change to go to Red Bank. Depending on what time of the year it was I suppose  I don't know.    Ms. Higgins: If we just had that now, it would be so much more pleasant on the road, wouldn't it? You said you were able to move around the county pretty readily on the trains.    Mr. Whitfield: Oh, yes, the railroad ran from Bay Head to New York and was the New York and Long Branch, which was a joint operation of the Central Railroad of New Jersey and the Pennsylvania Railroad and is now the North Jersey Coast Line. It's now electrified from Long Branch all the way into New York. South of Long Branch is still diesel operated, of course  in those old days it was steam. They had several branches: one branch ran from Freehold to Matawan. It was called the Freehold and New York Railroad  it became part of the Central Railroad. That was always Central Railroad of New Jersey, as well as the Seashore Branch between West End (Long Branch) and Matawan.    Ms. Higgins: Where were those tracks?    Mr. Whitfield: They ran up through Marlboro.    Ms. Higgins: Are they there now?    Mr. Whitfield: Yes, they're covered by weeds and stuff, and some people want to make that a hiking trail, but I believe they should save it for transportation because you're going to need it.    Ms. Higgins: Are you in favor of that?    Mr. Whitfield: I'm in favor of any trains.    Ms. Higgins: I am too.    Mr. Whitfield: For instance, when you go to New York. If you go on a bus, you get stuck in the same tunnel that everybody else does. And more people get hit by buses on highways than they do by trains. Look at the accident rate on Route 9. People get to jumping over that wall, and they have to put fences up, so they don't jump over the wall. And one of the problems is that the United States isn't pedestrian friendly. If you want to cross Route 9, you have to walk half a mile.  Half a mile is no problem at all in a car, but it's a problem if you are on foot.  And if you're an older person carrying bags and groceries across the highway, you can't do it.     Ms. Higgins: We used to go down to the train station when we first came to Monmouth County in 1955 to pick up my husband. Our little boy, he was about two or three, wondered if Daddy would come on a diesel or a puffy. When did the puffies go out?    Mr. Whitfield: The last scheduled steam engine was in 1957  it was the Pennsylvania Locomotive, because the Central Railroad had already found out it was more economical to run diesels. And of course, they became bankrupt, but they bought the diesels to try to save the operation because it was cheaper. It was less labor intensive, and labor is your big cost at any operation. People get paid and they got to eat. So they dieselized, and then they used the diesels for both passenger and freight. So they'd run a passenger train during the rush hours, then they'd use them for freight service during the day, and so they saved money that way. When you had a steam engine, you had to put it in the round house, and clean the fires, and have to have ICC inspections, and that takes a lot of labor.  For example, when the engine would get to Jersey City on the Central at a big roundhouse. In fact, the roundhouse in Jersey City was right where the Liberty Science Center is today. It's built right beside of the Old Central engine house. Finally, the state began to realize that they couldn't build enough roads to handle all the cars, and then started what they call "subsidizing the railroad."  But I like to think they should've invested in the railroad just as much as they invest in an airport. It's really interesting to see that they invest in the airports, they invest in the highways, but they subsidized the railroads. That's what's wrong with America.  England and European countries consider railroads a very vital part of transportation. Of course, distances are a lot shorter.    Ms. Higgins: Just driving over here, I heard a news broadcast that said with the higher speed of Amtrak trains, some of the New York bus drivers said, "We can't get the school bus across the tracks in the twenty seconds time there is warning."  So New York State's reply to that was to use a small bus.    Mr. Whitfield: The list of suggestions eliminate crossings, and of course, whatever you can. We had several unfortunate incidents when I was working in railroad. One time, the school bus went across right in front of one of our trains at Union Beach, and the crew saw it. And they said they could see the kid with his hands against the windows, terrified. The driver just ignored it.    Ms. Higgins: The bus driver?    Mr. Whitfield: The bus driver went right through the red lights.  That's the trouble with traffic lights on the highway. People go right by red lights all the time, and that's part of the reason we have road rage  but that's another story.    Ms. Higgins: But Conrail is no longer Conrail.    Mr. Whitfield: That's right. Just about a year and a half ago now  it was taken over by the Chessie System (CSX) and the Norfolk Southern. This was a model for merging railroads.  Chessie's System basically was the Railroads to Florida: the Seaboard Airline, and the Atlantic Coastline, and the Chesapeake Ohio and B&O and the Western Maryland.    Ms. Higgins: Was that good for Monmouth County that CSX was taking it over?    Mr. Whitfield: Well, both the CSX and the Norfolk Southern had some bugs.  I understand now, what they've done for Monmouth County. Norfolk Southern was the Norfolk and Western Railroad. It took over the Nickel Plate, and it took over part of the Southern Railway. They both wanted to buy Conrail for the access to New York. So what they've done, they've sort of split up the territory. Chessie is mainly responsible for the old New York Central Line up to New York State, Syracuse, and like that, and the Norfolk Southern has the old Pennsylvania line from Pittsburgh into New York that way.    Ms. Higgins: Does that take you out to Philly?    Mr. Whitfield: Yes, that's right. But in the New York/Metropolitan area they have what they call joint assets which was sort of a Shortline still called Conrail, to take care both railroads have access to Monmouth County and further up from the Middlesex County, Port of New York, and so forth and so on.    Ms. Higgins: I wanted to take the train a while ago to go into New York to keep an appointment, and I'm always very good about leaving myself plenty of time, because I know parking is tight. I drove around for half an hour looking for a place to park. It was a nice day-- I had no problem with walking a mile to the train station, but still I could not find a single, legal place to park within a mile of the train station. That's got to be resolved before I'm going to get back on the train.    Mr. Whitfield: They were talking about building a parking garage in Middletown, but people say they don't want the traffic coming to the railroad station. You have what people call "nimbys."    Ms. Higgins: What's a "nimby?"    Mr. Whitfield: Not in my backyard. (Laughter)  Freeholder Larrison said at a meeting where people were complaining about the ferry, "When I became a Freeholder, Monmouth County had 200,000 people. Now it has over 600,000."    Ms. Higgins: What's your opinion of the ferry service?    Mr. Whitfield: I think anything that deals with public transportation is good, because you can't handle the automobiles. I've been on a senior citizens bus trip for example: we have been to dinner theaters up off of Route 287 and so forth. Come down Route 287 on a bus at four o'clock in the afternoon, and in a bus you're up high. I look at the cars going by. Ninety percent of the cars had one passenger, and that's very inefficient, and of course they say, "Widen the road." I remember when they widened the Parkway to duelize the Parkway each way from South Amboy to Eatontown or Asbury Park actually. And the first thing that happened was all of a sudden we get more traffic and more congestion, so it's just as bad now. People are complaining about the E-Z Pass. My opinion of that is, people who use the parkway should pay their way, but not general taxpayers, and a good percentage of the parkway traffic is going to Atlantic City. These travelers are out-of-staters.    Ms. Higgins: They travel through Monmouth County.  When we came down in 1955, Route 36 was a sleepy two-lane highway.  How did you happen to come from Eatontown to Highlands?  Was that your next stop, or did you stop somewhere in between?    Mr. Whitfield: Well, I went in the army.  When I went in the army, I was working at the Lakehurst Station as a telegraph operator, and because I was working for the railroad company, I was deferred for a little while, because of the importance of it.  But finally, the war was getting heavy and they drafted us, and it so happened that they put me in the Air Force, which I thought was kind of weird, because I worked for the railroad. But they said, "The Air Force is tradition."  But I'm glad they did, because that's how I met my wife.    Ms. Higgins: Where?    Mr. Whitfield: In Louisiana, and if I hadn't been there, if I'd been in the railroad, I would've never met her, so that's a good thing.  We've been married fifty-five years.    Ms. Higgins: How did you meet your wife?    Mr. Whitfield: I went to church.  We got married on June 7, 1945 in The First Methodist Church of Alexandria, Louisiana by Dr. B. C. Taylor. At the time I met her, I was in B-17 training, and they were going to ship us to Europe.  They sent me to Hunter Field, Savannah, in March of 1945, I met her in January of 1945, and while I was there, I fell in love with her.  I knew she was the girl for me. Of course, I had to convince her a little bit.    Ms. Higgins: A marriage six months later didn't take too much convincing.    Mr. Whitfield: No.  Anyway, so I was in Hunter Field, and I went to the Trinity Methodist Church in downtown Savanna, and I'm sitting on the porch, and the Minister, Dr. George Cleary, asked me to teach a Sunday school class of young high school girls. And of course they all came because I was a GI, but I wasn't looking for them.  But, I'm sitting on the porch on the day President Roosevelt died....People ask, "Where were you when Kennedy was shot?"  I remember April 12, 1945.  The war in Europe was winding down, so then they decided they didn't need us, so I was transferred to Barksdale, Shreveport, Louisiana.  And that was 120 miles up from Alexandria. I'd hitchhike back and forth and she said, "You're going to kill yourself on the road." So then we got married in 1945, while I was still in the service. And at Barksdale I was in B-29 training, and then I was shipped to Kearney, Nebraska when they dropped the first bomb on Hiroshima.  Then a few days later, they dropped the second one. That was when Japan surrendered but I was at Kearney, Nebraska then, and we were supposed to be sent to Japan, but that was canceled. Actually, while I was in the service, they took me out to work for the Western Pacific Railroad for two months as a telegraph operator. Because of all the traffic being pushed from the east coast to the west coast along with a lot of other servicemen.  I worked there for two months, and when I got back to Kearney, my crew had been shipped out. I found out later that they never went overseas either.    Ms. Higgins: Do you feel without the atomic bombs perhaps you would've gone to help them invade Japan?    Mr. Whitfield: Well, no.  They would've probably kept me there because with everything being moved from the European theater, you didn't have any big humongous planes in those days.  In fact, in a little aside, they claimed all the allies won the European War because Hitler put all his faith in the Autobahn and neglected the railroad system.    Ms. Higgins: In Norway, they blew up the railroad tracks.    Mr. Whitfield: Whenever they hurt the railroads they helped us in Europe. I can recall as a boy, when the Army had the railroads in Fort Hancock. They had a railroad and they would bring the trains down and along the shore. One time they took them out of Fort Hancock to go down to Lewes, Delaware for maneuvers. I guess it was National Guard. I assume, because I don't know. I was still a young guy, but I'd see the guns going through the town on the tracks.    Ms. Higgins: There was no covering those up, because they were so big.    Mr. Whitfield: Oh yes, they were big. And the soldiers were hanging on the side of the flat cars. They were only going about twenty miles an hour, but the idea was to move along the railroad for coastal defense. And as I understand, they worked on something with a missile system. They had a place out in South Dakota in the 1960s.    Ms. Higgins: Can you tell me how you went from Long Branch into the service?    Mr. Whitfield: Well actually, my official residence was always with my parents in Eatontown. I went into the service and met Carolyn. When I came back from the service in 1946, I had my opportunity by seniority to take the jobs that had come open during the War. We had a very fine gentleman who was the mayor of Highlands, George Hardy. He was also the agent at the Highlands Station. Right after the war was over, he retired, and when I came back there they had a young man working the job who was not telegrapher, and they still handled the Western Union messages. And they wanted more telegraphers at the station so he said, "Well, that's a good job." It was only eight or ten miles from Eatontown where my folks lived, and that's how I got to Highlands. I was there for a while, and as things progressed, I worked at different places along what they call the Seashore Branch. I went to Atlantic Highlands Station, Port Monmouth Station, and because I was telegrapher, I became a train dispatcher at Long Branch in 1949.  I worked in Long Branch for over thirty years until Conrail came in. Then they closed those jobs down.  But that's how I got to Highlands. I like Highlands. We live right below the Twin Lights.  We live just under where the postal telegraph had a telegraph station, back before the days of radio. They had a gentleman by the name Steve Murray, who was the telegraph operator. And when he saw ships so many miles out and he would send a telegram in New York that such-in-such schooner was so many miles out of Sandy Hook. Of course, when the radio became prevalent, that service became obsolete. When Mr. Murray retired, somehow the family got the property, and my house is right underneath that property. Now that property is part of the state park. When the son-in-law, Mr. Masciale died, the state bought the property. It's part of the Twin Lights State Park now. And our property adjoins the Twin Lights.    Ms. Higgins: Who was the famous person who sent the signal overseas from the Twin Lights?    Mr. Whitfield: That was Marconi. Actually, I don't think the signal went overseas. That was wireless, and the first experiments done at the Twin Lights is a different form of telegraphy, because it's wireless telegraphy. But the telegraph that I did was on a wire. And the Telegraph Company also had to telegraph some places out at Sandy Hook overlooking the sea. There were different things within the paper about how they would send carrier pigeons out and the carrier pigeon would bring the message in, and the telegraph operator would send it to New York, and things like that that beat the ships.  The idea of the service was that the cargo ship owners could sign up for the service, and they'd know when their ship was going to be docked. They could have longshoremen down at the dock when the ship came in the harbor of New York.  That was the whole idea.    Ms. Higgins: Did the lights in the Twin Lights ever bother you when your family was living under them?    Mr. Whitfield: No, because actually by that time, the big heavy light was shut down. It was shut down when World War II started, because of the enemy convoys coming up the coast. In fact, a couple of years ago, they found the wreckage of U-869, right over in Manasquan. People thought that it had been sunk off the African Coast. There was a big article in the Asbury Park Press about it. Apparently when it shot its torpedo out of the sleeve, it homed in on its own self, and blew itself up.    Ms. Higgins: And what was the name of the ship?    Mr. Whitfield: It was the German U-Boat, U-2869. I have the article at home.    Ms. Higgins: Today, you are serving as part of the Monmouth County Transportation Advisory Board. What are your duties there, and what is that board doing now?    Mr. Whitfield: Well, we're trying to improve public transportation. As I said, I'm in favor of the rail service to New York. When I retired from the railroad, Judge LaBrecque recruited me to be on the committee. In fact, he tried to get me on when I was still working, but after Conrail came in, I was transferred from a train dispatcher's job in the office. I became what they call a trainmaster, and basically, I was in charge of the freight service in this area. It had nothing really to do with passenger service, except when we had trouble. And then we worked together.  I worked with another trainmaster on the electrification, and the first part of the electrification through South Amboy to Matawan, we had to coordinate the freight moves with the passenger trains, because of the construction work.  I had retired by the time they extended the electrification from Matawan to Long Branch, but I kept an interest in it, because I knew some of the people.    Ms. Higgins: Does it end in Long Branch now?    Mr. Whitfield: It ends in Long Branch now.  I would very much be in favor of extending that to Bradley Beach. There was some talk about abandoning a railroad south of Bradley Beach. Then they decided they wanted to keep it, because now  they realize that as people move down, the rail service should go down to Lakehurst  as soon as they could arrange it. The official position is that they want to try to go through Monmouth Junction, and  that's part of the problem. I think they should do both, but of course, economics is economics and nobody wants to pay for anything. Everybody wants something for free. Now, to answer the question about trains going by houses: I can recall when I was a boy, the trains went through Eatontown. I would wake up with the first train going out of Red Bank, and the one going to Lakehurst with the mail and other stuff. I'd be awakened, so I knew it was time to get up and start getting ready to go to school. But the train doesn't run that often. If you live along side of the highway, for example, you would hear much more  I've seen articles in New Jersey Magazine commenting on these sound barriers along the highway.  Traffic is a constant roar all day long. What's a train? The most a train runs is every ten minutes. You have nine minutes of silence.    Ms. Higgins: Besides, you like trains.    Mr. Whitfield: Well, most people do. In fact, one of the things that President Nixon said not too long before he died, was that he used to wake up in the morning and hear the train when he lived in California, and that was one of the things that was telling him to go. That was one of his reminiscences. Then, I had a case not too long before I retired. I was a trainmaster.  We hit an automobile in a crossing where the cars were supposed to stop  two women got knocked out of their car. The Middlesex County prosecutor came, and I won't mention his name. After I said, "We can provide the crew whenever you need them for an investigation." He said, "Mr. Whitfield, can I please ask you a favor? Can I please get up on the engine?" And I said, "Of course." Here's a man who was a county official, and he had never been on a locomotive!     Ms. Higgins: You have named lots of places where the trains used to go, but I can't think of any train stations except the old Middletown one and the Red Bank one.  Is there one in  Atlantic Highlands?    Mr. Whitfield: No, it burned down.    Ms. Higgins: Or Highlands?    Mr. Whitfield: Well, actually just until a little while ago, there was a piece of the old newsstand that was there when they had the station, but that fell apart. Buddy Bahrs was active in Monmouth County and now his son-in-law's family runs Bahrs Restaurant. But I can remember when his father would come over when I was the station agent in Highlands, and worry about how his son was running the business.    Ms. Higgins: Buddy's father?    Mr. Whitfield: Buddy's father.    Ms. Higgins: Let's talk about the Henry Hudson Regional High School. Was that of the first regional high schools in the area?    Mr. Whitfield: No, I think Freehold probably was the first.  Henry Hudson was formed about 1962.    Ms. Higgins: Where did the kids go to high school prior to that?    Mr. Whitfield: The Atlantic Highlands High School. Our oldest child went up to his freshman year in Atlantic Highlands, and then Henry Hudson started. Our second child, David, was in the first class that went from grade seven to twelve.  The two elementary schools in Atlantic Highlands and Highlands were reduced to grades K through six, and that's basically the way the district is today. My personal opinion is that it is too bad they didn't make it a regional district from grade K through twelve, but in New Jersey everything has to be home rule.  I was elected to the local Highlands Board, and after I had served five years in Highlands, I was elected to the Regional Board.  I served two terms in the Henry Hudson School Board. I enjoyed that very much, but when my work in the railroad started up here, I felt that I had to retire from the school board because by then I'd been working in Newark rather than Long Branch, and I was working nights sometimes. I asked not to be reelected, so when my second term was expiring, I dropped off the board.  Sometime later somebody asked me to run again, but I said, "Well, my total school board experience was eleven years.  I enjoyed it, and I have a lot of good friends that I still know from the school board."  One year George McCallum was a vice president and I was the president, and the next year we reversed jobs.  We used to rotate all the time.  I always felt I represented the whole district, and I think that's what any regional school board should do. We were there to educate the kids.  I'll say this for the record: any town that's a good town has a good school system, and I'm proud of the education my four kids got at Henry Hudson, and they all went to college.    Ms. Higgins: So, you have four kids.    Mr. Whitfield: We have two boys, a girl, and a boy. And our oldest son Mike lives in Alexandria, Virginia now.    Ms. Higgins: What does he do?    Mr. Whitfield: He's an accountant with a company called Hilltop Sand and Gravel, which builds golf courses on top of landfills which were originally sand pits.    Ms. Higgins: That's a good way to recycle.    Mr. Whitfield: That's right, and he likes to play golf, and he has two children.  One, our oldest grandson, is twenty-one and a student at William and Mary.  Our granddaughter, his daughter, seventeen is in High School.  Then, our second son, David, is at a Boy Scout camp, which has its headquarters in Winston Salem, NC.  He's the resident ranger and lives on the scout reservation in Raven Knob, Mount Airy, NC.  He has two sons: nineteen and seventeen.  The oldest one just became an Eagle Scout.  And then our daughter married a young man from Pennsgrove whom she met at church camp, and they have two children: fifteen and eleven this year.  They live in Coppell, Texas, which is a suburb between Dallas and Fort Worth.    Ms. Higgins: You and your wife must spend a lot of time in Dixie.    Mr. Whitfield: Our youngest son, John, lives at home with us.  But David was in the first class that went all the way through Henry Hudson School, and that was the year I was president of the board, so I had the honor of handing him his diploma.    Ms. Higgins: You say you were active in the church in Highlands.  What kind of things did a church in a small town do?    Mr. Whitfield: Well, we have a food pantry.  Right now, the church is on what we call a circuit.  The pastor makes one service in Sea Bright in the morning and the other one in Highlands.  They work for the community, the doors are always open, people invite people to come.  God offers a salvation, but some people do not accept it, and I'm not one to force religion down people's throats.  You're there, and you invite people to come, and we minister to the community whenever people come.  The Methodist tradition is that you always be respectful of other peoples' opinions.  That was one of the things that John Wesley, who was basically our founding pastor, taught.  Wesley was a clergymen in the Church of England, and when revolution came, he sent two men over to work with bishops to ordain more bishops.  Frances Asbury, for whom Asbury Park is named, had what they call a Christmas conference in the Christmas of 1784 in Baltimore, Maryland.  That was when the Methodist church in the United States began.  Churches were active in the United States before that, and one of the early leaders was a British Army Captain by the name of Webb. You go to Ocean Grove  you see these streets named after him and others. A young lady, Barbara Heck, came there where men were playing cards, and she picked up the cards in her apron and threw them in the stove, saying, "Men, if you don't start to preach, you're all going to go to hell."  And that was in a house on John Street in downtown New York.  That's our oldest Methodist society in the United States. Right down in the financial district.    Ms. Higgins: What other denominations does Highlands have?    Mr. Whitfield: Well, we two others, Episcopal and Catholic.  St. Andrews is the Episcopal Church and Our Lady of Perpetual Help is the Catholic Church.    Ms. Higgins: What was Highlands like when you first came in the 1940s?    Mr. Whitfield: Well, we actually lived there for a little while when we stayed with my folks after we got married.  We were down on Huddy Avenue then, where we rented for a while, and then had a chance to buy a house up underneath the Twin Lights, which we bought in 1947. So I've actually been a citizen of Highlands since 1946.    Ms. Higgins: What did Highlands look like in 1946?    Mr. Whitfield: We had a lot more bars.  We used to have thirty-two bars and three churches.      Ms. Higgins: Was clamming a big industry back in the 1940s?    Mr. Whitfield: We had clamming, and of course the river became polluted because they didn't know about the sewers. I understand years ago, now I never personally ran into this, but years ago there was a big division between the kids who lived downtown and the kids lived on the hill, and they would fight all the time, but when I got there, that had kind of gone down.  I heard stories about it, but it was before my time.    Ms. Higgins: And you actually lived in both places.    Mr. Whitfield: Well, just very briefly downtown. I like living up in the hill.  I'm above the flood plain.  We don't have to have flood insurance.    Ms. Higgins: There was a carousel in Highlands, right?    Mr. Whitfield: I can't remember when it burned, but I remember it burned.  Highlands is just going to go for their 100th anniversary this year, 2000.  It became a borough in 1900.  They tried to find out the day of the carousel burning, but the people doing the Highlands history haven't been able to find a date.  I can recall the burning, and I can recall our kids riding on it, but I can't recall when it burnt.    Ms. Higgins: There were many big fires: Alpine Manor Hotel, Tempus Fugit Hotel.  There must good firefighters in Highlands, because as close as the houses are, these things didn't seem to spread.    Mr. Whitfield: The problem with Highlands are the malls.  We used to have the mom and pop stores, but people started to go out of town to shop when they got cars and the mall.  We used Bedles Drug Store in Highlands, until they were taken over by CVS and moved up on the hill. We still have our prescription records there.  Fortunately, I don't get any prescriptions.    Ms. Higgins: Was there a movie house?    Mr. Whitfield: The movie house was made into a seafood store.  You know, you can go there and buy your clams on the half shell or your lobsters or whatever. And of course, Highlands is noted for its restaurants.  Bahrs is one.  Doris and Ed's is another.  A lot of them have been written up in the New Jersey Magazine.  Lots of good people come down and go. Another thing is, Highlands is right across the river from Sandy Hook.  But it has beautiful views. The only trouble is in the traffic in the summer, when everybody comes down by car and you can't get across the bridge.    Ms. Higgins: We need that trolley, Lester.    Mr. Whitfield: Yes, we need something. The trolley ran up on top of the hill and the train ran across along the foot of the hill. Now, when I first came to Highlands, the kids from Highlands went to school on the train to Atlantic Highlands.    Ms. Higgins: Is this how your children went?    Mr. Whitfield: No, because by the time they started going to high school, trains had stopped.    Ms. Higgins: But kids went by train to school in the Highlands once.    Mr. Whitfield: Yes.  When I was the agent in the Highlands, I would sell tickets every month.  The students would pick up their tickets. I had a list, and the Board of Education would cut me a voucher to pay for the student tickets.  I think they were four dollars a person per month.  Four dollars a month, and when they did away with the trains and put the buses on, they charged ten dollars a month, and I said, "You should've kept the train."  All the trains run into Newark now, instead of the old days, when the Central used to go into Jersey City terminal where Liberty Park is now.  They had a ferry across, and the Pennsylvania trains went to Penn Station.    Ms. Higgins: What are your recollections of people jumping off the bridge in Highlands?    Mr. Whitfield: I remember one of the kids in the Boy Scout troop got his fingers pinched  he was on a drawbridge.    Ms. Higgins: He didn't want to jump?    Mr. Whitfield: Well, I don't know what happened, but he was showing off, I think. But who knows?    Ms. Higgins: Would you explain this custom?    Mr. Whitfield: Well, kids would jump on the Sea Bright side, away from the channel. They wouldn't jump off the drawbridge itself, they'd jump off the fixed part, and they'd dive from the bridge and swim over to the shore.    Ms. Higgins: Regardless of boats that may be passing through?    Mr. Whitfield: Well, actually the only boat that would be in that area might be a rowboat or a little mussel boat.    Ms. Higgins: Did you ever do that jump?    Mr. Whitfield: No, I was grown up.  But I found out a couple of my kids did. They told me several years later, well after the fact, and I'm sure some other people's kids did it.    Ms. Higgins: It was something Highlands kids did.    Mr. Whitfield: There was a movie made several years ago that was filmed in Highlands.    Ms. Higgins: Really, what was it?    Mr. Whitfield: It was kind of a vulgar movie, I tell you.  Patricia Wettie was in it, and a girl jumped off a ferry boat.  Scenes were filmed in Highlands, and it was showing scenes of a flood.  We have it on videotape.  There were a lot of four letter words, and a lot of theological language used in non-theological sense.    Ms. Higgins: I'm sure.  Lester, can you also tell us about where you think Highlands is going?  What's Highlands going to look like in 2075?    Mr. Whitfield:  I understand some area people bought expensive houses and tore them down to make new houses.  In fact, there has been some talk about that happening in Rumson just recently.  I think that they've done some work on Bay Avenue: it looks a lot better now that they've got the sidewalks down.  I feel most sad about the proliferation of townhouses and apartments, because I'm afraid some of those will be the slums of tomorrow.  People who own their own houses care: that goes for all races, all creeds, and all national backgrounds.  You can go in the city of Newark and you can tell a house that's owned by the resident, because you'll see a nice oasis in the middle of a lot of slum houses.  I think Highlands, because of its location, has a future. Of course, you have to watch the seawall.  I was kind of ambivalent about pumping sand on the beaches because the wind takes it away, but it has made a difference for now. And of course that's an environmental thing.  I'm in favor of the environment, and I can also see what their talking about when they oppose  building high-rises right on the beach.  I think that's stupid.  For one thing, they're in danger of collapsing into the ocean. That was proven during one of these big hurricanes on the Gulf coast.  People were up in this high-rise having a big party and the storm came and the thing collapsed. And the whole bunch was killed.  That was during one of these hurricanes that happened several years ago down along the Mississippi or Alabama coasts.    Ms. Higgins: Could that happen on the Jersey Shore?    Mr. Whitfield: Well, you have Sea Bright, the high-rises in Monmouth Beach and Long Branch.  Furthermore, high-rises  take away property value.  And of course, the other thing, they're worried about is building too close to the hill.  The hill could collapse, and that's happened in California. The Jersey coast is more stable, but based on the location, I think Highlands is always going to be Highlands.  Would it be advantageous to become a part of a larger community?  There's some talk about making Sandy Hook a separate park from Gateway and I think the more you fractionalize things, the more it's costly.  You know, it's sort of like the railroads in the early days of railroading.  Before that, you'd go ten miles and have to change trains.  People don't want to do that.    Ms. Higgins: I guess not.    Mr. Whitfield: You had to change trains because you used to have different railroads, different gauges.  They were pretty much all standard gauges, but they were little short lines that built them, then they became part of the system. The Long Branch and Seashore was the original name of the Railroad Company up from through Long Branch to Sandy Hook, which became part of the Central Railroad.  But then you had the Keyport Dock Rail, The New Jersey Southern, which was originally the Delaware, Raritan Bay, became the New Jersey Southern, which became the Central Railroad of New Jersey's Southern Division. And lines up above in Northern New Jersey are all part of what became part of the Conrail eventually. So, you can go back in history, maybe they would make a new corporation with another ten miles of railroad. And they became part of the Central Railroad in New Jersey, which became part of Conrail which became part of New Jersey Transit.     Ms. Higgins: When you go swimming in the ocean, where do you go?    Mr. Whitfield: Sandy Hook.    Ms. Higgins: You ever walk over the rocks anymore?    Mr. Whitfield: Well, not anymore now.    Ms. Higgins: A previous interviewer out of Highlands said that a lot of residents of Highlands used to simply climb over those rocks and swim.    Mr. Whitfield: Yes, they do.  When I go, I usually go over for maybe a half an hour in the afternoon, and go to one of the beaches where there is a place to park.  It's easier to drive than walk, especially as I don't like to walk barefoot.  Kids are good that way, but the stones and pebbles hurt my toes and the soles of my feet.    Ms. Higgins: What is your opinion of beach rights?      Mr. Whitfield: I think the beaches belong to the public.  The public pays a good part of the money to protect them. Everybody should have the right to use them.    Ms. Higgins: And build them up, too?    Mr. Whitfield: But, I also believe in fees. I don't think it's fair for some farmer in Kansas to subsidize the land coast, because he's never going to get to use it. If people use it, they should pay for it.  I mean if you're going to come everyday.  I think car passes are reasonable.  That's what I get.  I'm a senior citizen, so I get the half-rate, but I don't think I went that many times to use the thirty dollars worth.  When our grandkids were little, they'd come more, and I'd take them out and we'd go swimming for a while.    Ms. Higgins: Do people still swim in the river in the Highlands?    Mr. Whitfield: Oh, yes.  Actually, Highlands has lifeguards now: one down by the bridge, one up at Miller Street, and one up by the Water Witch section by where the Community Center building is.  We have a good program at the Community Center: they have a preschool class, an after school class, and they have the senior citizens meet down there.  Lots of times they interact.  In fact, we've done some programs together.  They do a good job.    Ms. Higgins: Do you have any programs with the church?    Mr. Whitfield: We have Head Start in our church sponsored by the Inter-Community Coordinating Council, which is based in Neptune.  Our church in Highlands is just one of the schools in Monmouth County. They hire the staff  and we provide the space. This arrangement of course, helps the entire area.    Ms. Higgins: If you had a few things that you would like to say to future generations who will be reading and listening to this document, what would you say?    Mr. Whitfield: Number one: Remember the people who walk when you make any plans  make sidewalks.  I've mentioned this at the Planning Board of Transportation.  They widened Route 537, out by East Freehold Road: there's five lanes of traffic and not one sidewalk.  Once, when I went out to visit a friend at Applewood, I was getting ready to turn, and this man was riding against me on a bicycle.  I almost hit him because I couldn't see him in the dusk.  He had no place to ride, so he was riding basically in the driver's area.  I once read a book called Divided Highways, written with the idea that when we built the highways we ruined a lot of neighborhoods.  The sad part is that they provided for mass transit, but they've never put it in.  Everybody thought the automobile was going to be king and it isn't.  People move out to Arizona for their health, but the air pollution out there is almost as bad as it is here in New Jersey because of all the automobile exhaust.  People complain about the inspection system and blame the governor, but it's not the governor, it's the federal government.  The more you get the federal government to do things, the less you have control over things. I believe that the states should be able to run their own business.    Ms. Higgins: It seems like you don't want the little towns and the little schools to be running totally autonomously and yet, you don't want the federal government to have control.  You seem balanced.    Mr. Whitfield: I have a lot of friends from out of state, and I say, "Don't judge New Jersey by the Jersey Turnpike."  New Jersey is a wonderful state  I'm glad I was born here. And I say I'm a resident of Monmouth County and I'm proud to say that. I lived here all my life.  I can remember when Eatontown was a little town, and some of the things we did.  I remember going to the Worlds Fair on a train when I was seventeen.  I graduated from Long Branch High School in 1939  we just had our sixtieth high school reunion.  I used to arrange for train rides.  The school teacher would call up when I was in Long Branch and we would take the kids on train rides.  I like Monmouth County.  I think that our Freeholders are doing a good job.  I like what you're doing here  I think this is important. I like history. I've always been interested in history.  I think that this is a great country, and I don't want to divide it North and South.  I believe that the Confederate veterans have a right to be honored by the Confederate flag if they so choose.  My great-grandfather was killed at the Battle of Chancellorsville.  He was a second lieutenant in a New Jersey thirteenth regiment.  That's the same battle at which Thomas "Stonewall" Jackson was killed by his own troops.  He was mortally wounded.  He was also wounded at Antietam and I had the privilege of going to Antietam, but that's where we lost 17,000 American boys because of people not loving one other.  War is wrong.  I don't believe in war.  The people who fight aren't the guys who make the money. And that's the another thing: we should honor our veterans. The poor guys that went to Vietnam were spit at.  That's wrong.    Ms. Higgins: Have you ever considered running for public office yourself?    Mr. Whitfield: My wife said she would divorce me if I did, and I don't want to get divorced.  The only thing I ran for was the school board.  When Bob Wilson was still mayor of Highlands, somebody asked me if I'd run for mayor.  They proposed my name and I didn't know it. But you know, I wouldn't ever run.    Ms. Higgins: It seems natural  it really does.    Mr. Whitfield: I enjoyed going to the meetings with Judge LaBrecque, but I don't say too much.  I said I was his designated driver, because I took him to the transportation meeting.  I drove the car.  He was a fine gentleman. I knew him long before he was a judge, when he was a lawyer, and he was interested in transportation like I was.  That's why I appreciated working with him and Ted Narozanick.  I am most proud of being appointed to the Monmouth County Transportation Committee.  We had two Democrats and three Republicans on the Board of Chosen Freeholders  all five of them voted for me.  I think that the answer to the question what they should do with the Freehold Line and on the Highlands is to put a light rail line in from Freehold all the way down to Highlands, and connect it with the coastline at Matawan.  People could come in, and it could be very well done with a new Matawan-Aberdeen station.    Ms. Higgins: It's been a real pleasure interviewing you.  Thank you, Lester.    
MonmouthCounty;Frank Mocci;xxxx;2000;Frank Mocci, xxxx, 2000        Remembering The 20th Century: An Oral History of Monmouth County      Mr. and Mrs. Mocci,   Christmas 1999  Date of Interview: April 17, 2000    Name of Interviewer: Lydia Wikoff  Premises of Interview: Ms. Wikoff's home, Manalapan, NJ  Birthdate of Subject: N/A    Ms. Wikoff: Mr. Mocci is a lifelong resident of Monmouth County, and he's going to tell about growing up and farming in Hazlet. My mother, Grace Stillwell, taught him in grades three through five. I hope that he'll reminisce about his children and everything he'd like to tell us about. Tell us about your family, approximately when they came over.    Mr. Mocci: My father came from Naples, Italy in 1907. My mother came here in 1910. They had known each other in Italy, but they had no idea what part of America they were coming to. And they met after a couple of years in Matawan. I think they got married in 1912. Then they started their family. He used to work for a fellow by the name of Frank Nunziata. He used to sell fertilizer and seeds  he worked for him for ten dollars a month for three years. And then after three years, Nunziata had a farm, and my father worked as a share crop holder. But my father made twenty-five and Frank made seventy-five, and my father did all the work. Still he made probably a thousand, twelve hundred dollars a year  but he had to work hard. Then he bought a little farm from a fellow by the name of Montana, on Hillcrest Road, and that's where he started farming. He bought all his equipment from Pete O. Weigand, at the Hazlet Trading Post.    Ms. Wikoff: I remember that name. Pete O. Weigand was president of the school board, I think.    Mr. Mocci: Yes, he was. And that's where my father bought his plow. He bought a team of horses, and that's where he started farming. And he farmed there for three years and then he bought a farm in Matawan. After every three or four years, he'd sell the farm, make five or six hundred, a thousand dollars, and buy another place. In 1924 he bought the Homestead in Hazlet from Ackerson, Judge Ackerson, but he paid a lot of money.    Ms. Wikoff: How many acres?    Mr. Mocci: There were forty-five acres. But he paid a lot of money for that ground - thirteen thousand dollars because he was an Italian. My father was the first Italian who had property in Hazlet. This was in 1924.    Ms. Wikoff: That's the year I was born.    Mr. Mocci: Then he bought another piece of ground from Mrs. Morrow, Emmy Morrow. We had been renting it  it was forty acres, and we bought it from her. This is five or six years after he bought the Ackerson farm. We were the only house that had a telephone. All the neighbors had to come to our house. The telephones were wind up. I joined the Hazlet Fire Company, but I was blackballed twice because I was an Italian. And after I joined, then my brothers joined, and we were all in the fire company, three brothers in the Hazlet Fire Company. Every time the whistle blew we all went to the fire. My father used to raise hell because we all went to the firehouse. I got married in 1942  my wife comes from Brooklyn. She'd never seen a farm before in her life.    Ms. Wikoff: How did you happen to meet?    Mr. Mocci: It's a long story. My father and my mother knew her family in Italy  they were what they call "paisan": they come from the same town. It's a small world. We had two kids, Joe and Carol. My father loaned five thousand dollars towards a new building for the fire company. It was a small building. There was one bay there for one truck and then they built the new bay and put three trucks in. That's why my father loaned five thousand dollars toward a new building. And I don't remember whether the whole building was fifteen or twenty thousand.    Ms. Wikoff: That was a huge donation, and in those days. He was a very generous person.    Mr. Mocci: There's a fellow by the name of Lon Lauton. He was very friendly with my father, and he was the president of the fire company. He got my father to loan him five thousand dollars.    Ms. Wikoff: One thing mother used to tell me was that when you were busy on the farm, planting and picking, that farm children didn't go to school, so she would try to tutor you to make up for what lessons you lost. Is that true?    Mr. Mocci: Yes, that's true. We had twenty acres of asparagus when we were young. There's forty-acre piece that my father bought that had twenty acres of asparagus. We used to cut the asparagus, we used to ridge the rows, we used to cut white asparagus, that's called Oyster Bay.    Ms. Wikoff: In Germany, that's the kind of asparagus they cut. It is white. That's a lot of work.    Mr. Mocci: Right. And you got to keep ridging it up. And that ground there, if the wind blew it was light brown, and on a good windy day, it would knock them right down, so my father would have a team of horses with a ridger.    Ms. Wikoff: We had a ridger, remember?    Mr. Mocci: Yes. With a team of horses, he would ridge up the rows, and we used to start, me, and my brother, and two men, and my father. We'd start cutting asparagus like five thirty in the morning, and by nine o'clock we were always in the same spot when the bell would ring at the school, and we'd run across. Frank Weigand used to live right across.    Ms. Wikoff: I remember where he lived.    Mr. Mocci: We used to run across his back yard there and go to the school. Frank came with his hands all dirty and your mother wouldn't -    Ms. Wikoff: But she was a farmer's wife - how about that?    Mr. Mocci: But we used to leave the field, and my father used to say, "Can't you take a day off and finish cutting asparagus?"    Ms. Wikoff: When you got hurt or sick, how would you get cared for? Did you ever go to a doctor?    Mr. Mocci: My mother was the doctor. There were eleven in my family, and two died at birth, so there were nine of us living, and my mother was the doctor. She'd give us Coca Cola with syrup when you had a cold - that took care of the cold. You also got hot bricks on your feet in the wintertime if you got a cold. We had a hot air furnace. Downstairs - oh, it used to burn up, and upstairs was always cold.    Ms. Wikoff: And if you stood there, if you were a girl, it would fill up your skirts.    Mr. Mocci: And if you got on it too hot in bare feet, you'd burn your feet.    Ms. Wikoff: I never heard about the hot bricks. Did they ever use those mustard plasters?    Mr. Mocci: Oh, when my sister had pneumonia, my mother used to make, hot plaster, mustard plaster, and half the time it used to burn the skin.    Ms. Wikoff: That was the way you took care of it. But didn't doctors sometimes come out to the house?    Mr. Mocci: Yes. Our doctors were Dr. Cassidy and Dr. Silcox. You must have heard of him. He was an old timer there in Keyport.    Ms. Wikoff: I remember a Gaswine from Matawan.    Mr. Mocci: Dr. Gaswine. And he had a son who also became a doctor. But Dr. Cassidy, he delivered most of the babies. Most of the babies were born at the house. My father delivered the first part of them. Then Dr. Cassidy used to come in and finish the job.    Ms. Wikoff: What big events happened that you remember? Of course there used to be boats that left from Keyport.    Mr. Mocci: Oh, yes. The farmers used to bring stuff to the pier at Keyport, and put it on the boat. I remember my father used to go to Keyport with other farmers, especially on a Sunday afternoon. All the farmers would go get in line  they had to wait for the boat to come in, because they couldn't all get on the boat at one time. And they had these horses parked in Keyport.    Ms. Wikoff: Did you ever take the ride that was like kind of a cruise boat, almost, that would take you into New York?    Mr. Mocci: Oh, yes, many a times.    Ms. Wikoff: That was really fun.    Mr. Mocci: Yes, it was. I remember when the Holland Tunnel opened up. I think we were the fifth or sixth car going to New York, and that was something! To go through the Holland Tunnel was some experience. The big thing was when my father used to get all the little kids on the truck and we'd go to Union Beach. We'd go down to the beach, like on a Sunday afternoon. That was a big outing, to go swimming on a Sunday afternoon. We used to bring some cooked stuff, and that was a big party then, to get on the truck with the food and go to Union Beach.    Ms. Wikoff: And then didn't Keansburg become really quite popular as a shore resort?    Mr. Mocci: Union Beach and Keansburg were the biggest ones. There was a pier for people who came in by boat to Keansburg, and then they used to have these small busses that used to take them to Long Branch, places like that.    Ms. Wikoff: Tell us about going to the Newark market. That was a big event.    Mr. Mocci: I started going to Newark market with my father when I was ten or eleven years old, and we went there for three or four seasons during the summer. Then when I was fifteen years old, I got my drivers license. Fifteen years old.    Ms. Wikoff: Was it a farmers license?    Mr. Mocci: No, it wasn't a farmer's license. My father knew the police, and Father Burke in the St. Joseph church gave me a birth certificate, and I got my driver's license. From the day I got my driver's license right up until I didn't go to the market any more, my father never went to the market any more. I went to Newark Market for maybe ten, twelve years, and then from there I went to the Fourteenth Street Market in New York. Then I started going to the Bronx Terminal Market. I went there for about twenty years, twenty-five years. Then we started selling direct to the chain stores, and that was one of the worst things we ever did. They told us what to raise, what they're going to pay you for it, and that's it. At least when you went to market, today was one price, tomorrow was another. When you went to the chain store - but we were lucky, we had some good chain stores that we went to.    Ms. Wikoff: My dad used to go to market and a lot of the times he had to come home with some of the load and he didn't know what to do with it. If it was tomatoes, they would get rotten  it was terrible. Did any of them kind of rip you off? I remember Dad saying that some people would jump on the truck as you came in and try to do that.    Mr. Mocci: The worst part of Newark Market was that it was a market all night long. So if you try to get a couple hours sleep, somebody tells you how much. Then if you ask them for a dollar, you take fifty cents. But I always managed, we always raised a good package of stuff, and we were always noted for a good package of stuff, at the Newark Market or the Bronx Terminal, wherever we went, and that's what counts.    Ms. Wikoff: Did you have to wash the vegetables before you took them?    Mr. Mocci: Yes. All the vegetables were dipped in water, and then we got a brusher, brush tomatoes, brush peppers, and then -    Ms. Wikoff: Automatic brushes?    Mr. Mocci: Yes, Tuscot. You remember the Tuscot potato grader?    Ms. Wikoff: Charles probably does.    Mr. Mocci: Well, we had it for vegetables, with brushes. Then we got the big brushes, the waxer, the washer, everything there. We had a regular assembly line.    Ms. Wikoff: Did you ever hear of a farmer by the name of Ed Sickle, from Tennent? He used to go the Newark Market and I remember he was the first one that had that washing equipment.    Mr. Mocci: They're still in business, Ed Sickle. Didn't he have a Dodge agency?    Ms. Wikoff: That was a different Ed Sickle. But then when you came home from market, I know what you had to do, you had to go right to work. Right?    Mr. Mocci: Yes, we went to work and sometimes I didn't see my kids until the weekend. I'd go to market five days a week -    Ms. Wikoff: And your other brothers were home helping?    Mr. Mocci: Yes, but I was the only one at the market. If we had two loads, another brother would drop off a load to me. But when I went to the Bronx, I sold a lot of stuff in the Bronx Market. And you know something. I never brought anything home. I always managed to sell everything.    Ms. Wikoff: See, you were a good salesman. My father wasn't, he really wasn't, and it was too bad.    Mr. Mocci: When we were young, my father said never take anything home, because if you take something home either you have to repack it or dump it. He'd always find somebody -- he'd always find a buyer for it.    Ms. Wikoff: But like you say, though, you had a good name. And buyers would probably come to your truck. That's the reason.    Mr. Mocci: I was selling tomatoes in the Bronx Terminal Market one Sunday afternoon. The Italian paper, the Progressive, that was like The Daily News, came over. I had put four hundred fifty, five hundred bushels of tomatoes on the truck. They were three quarter bushels, peach baskets, and they had covers, and we had boards on the truck, and we used to put them eight high in that truck. And on Sunday afternoons there would always be a mob of private people buying tomatoes to can, and on this Sunday afternoon, there were so many people around the truck that they called The Progressive to take pictures of people taking tomatoes off the truck.    Ms. Wikoff: Did you ever see the picture in the paper?    Mr. Mocci: Yes.    Ms. Wikoff: Did you save it?    Mr. Mocci: No.    Ms. Wikoff: I thought you were going to say the eight tiers tipped or something. Was The Progressive written in Italian?    Mr. Mocci: Yes.    Ms. Wikoff: That's interesting. Those were the unusual days, weren't they? I was going to get back to whatever holidays you had. What games did you play when you got together as a family?    Mr. Mocci: We used to like to play bocce ball.    Ms. Wikoff: You had to have nice grass for that.    Mr. Mocci: No, the rougher the ground the better it is.    Ms. Wikoff: Usually they have golf course turf.    Mr. Mocci: The old timers used to play for wine. My father used to be good. My father made ten to fifty gallon barrels.    Ms. Wikoff: That's what I was going to ask, if he made his own wine.    Mr. Mocci: Yes, he made his own wine.    Ms. Wikoff: Out of what?    Mr. Mocci: Mostly Concorde grape. Local Concorde grape. But he made a couple of barrels of California grape, but that was strong, and he couldn't drink too much of that. We had three or four monthly men working on the farm, and that's what they wanted, they wanted a glass of wine. We fed them, too, and my mother used to do their laundry and everything, besides taking care of the nine kids she had.    Ms. Wikoff: She was a worker. I remember the vineyards there in the Hazlet area. You had some vineyards, too, didn't you?    Mr. Mocci: Oh, yes, we had eight, nine acres of grapes. That used to be the big job in the wintertime, trimming and tying the grapes.    Ms. Wikoff: Did you ever have to take the grapes to market?    Mr. Mocci: Most of the grapes we took to Perth Amboy Market. A lot of Polish people there used to make their own wine.    Ms. Wikoff: We had a neighbor who used to go to Perth Amboy Market.    Mr. Mocci: That's why most of the grapes we sold in Perth Amboy. And a lot of people used to come down to Hazlet to buy them.    Ms. Wikoff: There's a new magazine that has just come out, Martha Stewart Living, and the whole center part of it is about dandelions, and dandelion wine. I have heard about making dandelion wine, but you didn't need to because you had the grapes.    Mr. Mocci: Well, my younger brother used to fool around and make dandelion wine. He made it out of the flowers. But that was strong, that was strong wine, and bitter.    Ms. Wikoff: I'll show you that article because it says how good dandelions are for you.     Mr. Mocci: Well, you know down in the South Vineland section dandelions are a big thing. They grow dandelions under the plastic and they get it early. It's nice and tender and it's clean because the plastic is over it. A friend of mine from Vineland sent me twenty pounds about three weeks ago, UPS, in the plastic bags.    Ms. Wikoff: So what are you going to do with them?    Mr. Mocci: I cook them, and we put some in the freezer.    Ms. Wikoff: Well, you're going to be very healthy! You just can't imagine all that dandelions can do for you. I never knew that.    Mr. Mocci: Dandelions are good for you. Every year Joe Petragneol sends me a box of dandelions. He's a big farmer in Vineland.    Ms. Wikoff: Do you get together with any of your old friends that were farmers?    Mr. Mocci: Yes. Especially down in South Jersey there are quite a few farmers and we get together.    Ms. Wikoff: Did some of them move down to South Jersey from this area?    Mr. Mocci: Yes.    Ms. Wikoff: That's what happened with the kind of farming we did. People moved from here down to Maryland because the land was so much cheaper and they were able to sell their farms at a profit here.    Mr. Mocci: Maghan is doing a good job down there.    Ms. Wikoff: That's what I've heard.    Mr. Mocci: We buy five or six loads of pumpkins every year. He raises beautiful pumpkins. It's all new ground.    Ms. Wikoff: This is just so much fun I forget to ask you questions. You say you used to play bocce, and the kids must have played hide-and-seek and things like that.    Mr. Mocci: Oh, that was a big game, hide-and-seek, and we played it in the hay mound.    Ms. Wikoff: Really, that was a lot of fun.    Mr. Mocci: We had eight horses, and grew most of the hay where Bell Labs is now. My father and a couple of farmers would get together. There would be a couple hundred acres of hay there, so they'd cut it, and a lot of times they'd bring it in loose, before they had the baler.    Ms. Wikoff: Oh, yes, I remember sometimes those loads would get tipped over.    Mr. Mocci: One time, I'll never forget. We had a Model T Ford, and a guy had a load of hay on it. He went to go and the load was too wide, and the Model T went right straight up in the air. They were very light anyway. Didn't take them much to go up in the air. They only had that little motor in the front.    Ms. Wikoff: How many men did it take to unload your hay into the barn?    Mr. Mocci: We were modern, we had a horse with a fork.    Ms. Wikoff: Oh, I know, I used to drive the horse.    Mr. Mocci: Stick the fork in the pulley and bring it up on the hay mound. The horse did all the work.    Ms. Wikoff: But, there had to be somebody in the hay mound.    Mr. Mocci: Yes, well, we kids, we didn't mind working. We were five brothers.    Ms. Wikoff: You must have had a cow.    Mr. Mocci: We had two cows. My father always had two cows. One cow came fresh and he'd always raise a calf. There used to be a circus when Marx, the butcher from Red Bank Marx, used to come down and buy the calf. My father was a good bargainer. The butcher would tell my father, "I'll be there at twelve o'clock to pick up the calf." Well that calf got a belly full of milk by twelve o'clock, so he would weigh more  he was loaded. He was butchered.    Ms. Wikoff: I always felt bad when that happened  it looked like it hurt them, but it really didn't.    Mr. Mocci: No, it didn't hurt them. The butcher knew how to do it.    Ms. Wikoff: So selling the calf kind of helped pay for your milk.    Mr. Mocci: That way we'd have fresh milk all the time. The cow, when it's going to have a calf, can't be milked for a couple of months.    Ms. Wikoff: Did your mother also sell butter?    Mr. Mocci: No, we made cheese and butter for the family.    Ms. Wikoff: We didn't have as big a family, and when we would get too much milk, I remember my mother used to make what we called pot cheese. They call it cottage cheese now.    Mr. Mocci: We used to make cottage cheese, and the pigs used to get the water from the cottage cheese.    Ms. Wikoff: Did you have pigs?    Mr. Mocci: Oh, yes. Every year we killed seven or eight pigs.    Ms. Wikoff: And then did you smoke your ham?    Mr. Mocci: We used to smoke it. Then we took it to a fellow in Keansburg who smoked the bacon and the hams. The hams my father always did, the real Italian hams,   prosciutto.    Ms. Wikoff: Charles's family had a smoke house and they always had it filled with hams and bacon and sausage.    Mr. Mocci: My father used to put them under the press after he had had them in the brine for ten or twelve days, then he'd put the ham in the press and take all that salt water and all the blood and stuff, and he used to press them and they used to come real flat. Then they used to put a lot of black pepper on them and put them in the cheesecloth, and then they used to hang them up in the wagon shed. They used to be better the following year because they'd be nice and dry. The black pepper was so the flies wouldn't get in.    Ms. Wikoff: Tell us about smoking of the hams.    Mr. Mocci: My father would always kill six, seven pigs. And he used to bag them in brine. Oh, maybe twenty days in the brine, and every once in a while he used to turn them. Then he used to put the hams in a wine press and leave them under the press for maybe a week or ten days, every day going in to squeeze the press a little bit more. Then when they were cured, he used to put black pepper, the big pepper on them, and put them in cheese cloths, and hang them up in the wagon shed. Like the smoked bacon.    Ms. Wikoff: Did you ever make sausage?    Mr. Mocci: Yes. We put in those casings. We used to make sausage. And some of the sausage my mother used to make lard.    Ms. Wikoff: I know, just think, now today we aren't supposed to eat all that fat! Did you have somebody come to kill the pig? That was a big operation.    Mr. Mocci: A fellow by the name Curley used to kill them.    Ms. Wikoff: People used to do that as a profession.    Mr. Mocci: Yes. Will Ganzi was the other name.    Ms. Wikoff: Tell us about your summer kitchen.    Mr. Mocci: We had a summer kitchen. In wintertime that's where we used to cut the pigs. But my father built a summer kitchen to have a big cellar to keep his wine in. In other words, he had the big cellar downstairs, and on top of that was a summer kitchen. It was a big summer kitchen. And that's where we used to cut up the pigs. We had a couple of freezers in there.    Ms. Wikoff: You really ate well. Did your wife do a lot of canning?    Mr. Mocci: Yes. We did a lot of canning, in fact, we still do a lot of canning today. We still do a lot of tomatoes.    Ms. Wikoff: I still do tomatoes, too.    Mr. Mocci: I've got so much stuff in the freezer, I give it away. Most of it we give it away because we can't eat it all.     Ms. Wikoff: I should have told you to bring some!    Mr. Mocci: Like those dandelions I was telling you about, a lot of dandelion, and we have escarole, spinach, corn, eggplant, fried eggplants, and roast peppers in the freezer.    Ms. Wikoff: How do you freeze the corn?    Mr. Mocci: I've got a contraption that takes the corn off the cobs. It works very well. Especially super sweet. Super sweet freezes very well  it's always sweet, never loses its taste.    Ms. Wikoff: Is super sweet a white corn?    Mr. Mocci: Yes. And then there's the bi-color corn, that's super sweet too. It's half yellow and half white.    Ms. Wikoff: I do think that farmers eat well. Especially in the olden days, I don't know today, because we get most of the stuff from the stores.    Mr. Mocci: That's one thing I have to say, we always had plenty to eat in the house.    Ms. Wikoff: As poor as you might be.    Mr. Mocci: My mother used to make homemade butter.    Ms. Wikoff: And bread.    Mr. Mocci: Actually, my sister and I used to make bread once a week. Once a week we used to make fifty pounds of flour into bread, and my sister and I used to work the bread, and my mother used to tell us to keep pounding some more and to keep turning.    Ms. Wikoff: You made an awful lot then.    Mr. Mocci: We had an outside oven.    Ms. Wikoff: A beehive oven, we called it.    Mr. Mocci: An Italian made oven. We used to make eight, nine, ten loaves of bread at a time, those big loaves.    Ms. Wikoff: Do you still have that oven?    Mr. Mocci: No, that's gone.    Ms. Wikoff: And what kind of bread?    Mr. Mocci: Mostly white bread, and some was rye bread. She used to mix it. We had a lot of peach trees, and we'd trim the peach wood and stack it by the oven. That's what my father used to burn to make the oven real hot, that fine dried up peach stuff. He'd get up by four o'clock in the morning to light the oven, and my mother would have all this bread on the table. Once you make the bread, it's got to rise for three or four hours, and when it got nicely risen is when we used to put it in the oven.    Ms. Wikoff: Did that last you one whole week, the amount that you made?    Mr. Mocci: Oh, yes.    Ms. Wikoff: So you really didn't have to go the store.    Mr. Mocci: Oh, no, we never bought bread. And the longer the bread stayed, the better it was.    Ms. Wikoff: Well, we've learned an awful lot about farming. How many years did you belong to the fire company?    Mr. Mocci: I joined the fire company in 1937, and I guess I've been in the company about sixty-four years. And there's only one member is older than me, so I'm second on the list.    Ms. Wikoff: They don't make you do the fires anymore. Do they still hold suppers and things like that to make money?    Mr. Mocci: Yes. But our fire company has so much money that they don't have to raise that much.    Ms. Wikoff: Well, of course the county and the towns help them out now.    Mr. Mocci: The fire company used to own a lot of land. We used to hold fairs and stuff there. When the fire company sold it, they got over a million dollars for that property back there. Over a million dollars, and that's how we were able to buy all the equipment, plus the county buys a lot. We've got a nice firehouse.    Ms. Wikoff: Do they hold the fairs in the firehouse?    Mr. Mocci: Some. We have the annual dinner on Highway 9 at a big catering place called Excelsior and other catering places.    Ms. Wikoff: What would you consider are the biggest things that happened in your life? How many grandchildren do you have?    Mr. Mocci: I have five grandchildren and one great-grandchild.     Ms. Wikoff: And then you still celebrate with the family? The family comes for certain birthdays and things like that?    Mr. Mocci: Oh, yes. We still hold most of the parties at my house. Christmas Eve we have at my house. But the Italians have got to have all that different fish, and me and my wife cook all the fish on Christmas Eve. We start cooking about four o'clock in the afternoon. We use mostly shrimp, spaghetti with the anchovies - mostly deep-fried. Baccala is a must, but we had all different kinds of fish.    Ms. Wikoff: Deep-fried! Oh my goodness, what a lot of work that is.    Mr. Mocci: Yes, but I've got a basement that is like a restaurant downstairs. That's where we do all our canning and everything. I do all my cooking downstairs. I'm not allowed to cook upstairs. And I keep a nice, clean kitchen, too. No matter what I cook, I clean up  I never leave a mess.    Ms. Wikoff: That's what's important.    Mr. Mocci: My daughter comes to make her sauce there. A lot of people come and use my basement.    Ms. Wikoff: Well, that's wonderful the way you've shared. Are there many families left that you still know in the area?    Mr. Mocci: Not too many left around Holmdel and Hazlet. DeGregoria is a good friend of mine. Do you remember the DeFidele in Colts Neck? We did about the same type farming.    Ms. Wikoff: And then what about Lucarelli?    Mr. Mocci: Lucarelli? Well, Dominick used to be a big farmer. We were with his wife just last night  we went to an anniversary. She was in Florida and she had just come back. She was in Florida for three months. Dolores. Do you know Dolores Lucarelli?    Ms. Wikoff: Charles might know him. I think he was active with the Board of Agriculture. I don't go there, but I understand that Dearborn is a wonderful place.    Mr. Mocci: It's a beautiful place, they've got beautiful stuff. I think it's as good as Delicious Orchards.    Ms. Wikoff: And then they do catering also, don't they?    Mr. Mocci: A lot of catering. They've got a wonderful deli. You should go there just to see the deli that they have. Beautiful place. You've got to wait in line. They've got a line from morning until nighttime. Unbelievable.    Ms. Wikoff: But that's kind of the answer to farming today. It's called direct marketing, and it seems that you have to do that.    Mr. Mocci: They get a lot of stuff direct. Plus they've got two trucks that go up to the city every day. Sixty-five percent of their business is the deli. You've never seen so much cooked food. People come and buy cooked food and take it home and eat it. My daughter does, too.    Ms. Wikoff: We went to a marketing conference and once somebody said, "You know if we only had another depression, we farmers might make out better. People would have to cook and not get all prepared foods." It was kind of a shock, but it's the truth.    Mr. Mocci: You know, people are making too much money today. Things sell for five, six, seven dollars a pound. How much does it cost you to make an eggplant parmesan? Six, seven dollars a pound there. Everything.    Ms. Wikoff: You were going to tell us about your son Joe's business. He's not farming, so you can tell us what he's doing.    Mr. Mocci: He does a little bit of farming. He farms about ten acres. But mostly they plant pumpkins on about three acres. We plant the pumpkins with the vine. But we plant the pumpkins late, to make sure the vines are all nice and green. The Ganz pumpkins are all over. We have a big thing with these pumpkin rides. We've got three wagons that never stop. Two hayrides.    Ms. Wikoff: Well, people really come for that.    Mr. Mocci: And we have a lot of these school trips  we don't want them anymore.    Ms. Wikoff: Don't they pay per child, or something?    Mr. Mocci:  I think it's two dollars. I think they give the children a pumpkin and an apple or a gourd. Something like that.    Ms. Wikoff: Well, that's the way of farming today.    Mr. Mocci: These local schools around here are nice. But get some of these kids from out of the city, oh, they're bad news. That's what Casola's got, all kids from the city. Bus loads from the city. A few years ago we had a busload come from Jersey City. You know they never knew pumpkins grew in a field.    Ms. Wikoff: Well, that's like the milk. City kids never knew the milk came from the cow, they thought it came from the bottle.    Mr. Mocci: They thought that pumpkins were made by hand.    Ms. Wikoff: How many acres do you have left?    Mr. Mocci: Ten acres. There were eleven, but I subdivided one acre where I built my house, and ten acres with another, my house where I used to live before. My grandson works there and his two kids. And they're very busy. I'm there every morning, the company comes, and we make coffee at ten o'clock. I've got my own room there. So anytime you're down that way and want coffee, stop down at ten o'clock.      Bayshore Greenhouse store front  Ms. Wikoff: First you told us about your son, who has the greenhouse business that's turned out to be very good. Even your grandchildren work in it.    Mr. Mocci: I have three grandchildren working there and they're doing a very good job.    Ms. Wikoff: You go there and check up on them in the morning.    Mr. Mocci: Oh, I'm there every morning for three or four hours. I do mostly watering for a couple of hours in the morning. Then I have company come in, as I said, I've got my own coffee shop. My son works very hard over there.    Ms. Wikoff: Well, it comes from your background. Then I want to ask about your daughter who is teaching. She got the award for Best Teacher of the Year.    Mr. Mocci: She's been teaching for about fifteen years in Indian Hill School in Holmdel. And she's a very good teacher and she works very hard at it. Governor Whitman came down to visit the school and that's the grade that she picked to visit. And she spent a whole day there. They put on a play, and my daughter got quite a write up. Then Governor Whitman invited my daughter and her husband to dinner in Trenton, so they're very nice.    Ms. Wikoff: That was very nice. And didn't you say that her class did something kind of special?    Mr. Mocci: They had a bake sale and all the money went to Ronald McDonald House.    Ms. Wikoff: So you have two children you can be very proud of.    Mr. Mocci: I have, and five beautiful grandchildren, and a great granddaughter, and great grandson.    Ms. Wikoff: Please tell us about the different places that you farmed and tell us about the crops.      Mr. Mocci (far left) in front of the greenhouses with his family  Mr. Mocci: We used to farm a hundred and five acres here in Holmdel at one time. Holmdel and Hazlet. And we used to grow everything under glass, under hot bed sash. We only had one small greenhouse where we used to start the seed. And even when we bought the Marlboro farm, we used to grow all the plants over here in Holmdel and bring all the plants up there. We grew them here and took them up to Marlboro to plant. The farm was on Pleasant Valley Road, between the Home of Good Shepherds and the Marlboro State Hospital. We had one hundred and fifty five acres. First we bought ninety-five acres, and then about seven years later we bought another farm from Lenny Stevenson, which was another fifty-four acres. That farm that we bought in Marlboro, they used to call that the Chinese farm. It was the old Crine. Remember Crine? Well, Crine sold it to these Chinese, there were seven partners. We bought the farm in 1954, when the Parkway came through. And we were vegetable growers. We grew tomatoes, peppers, eggplants, and a lot of spinach, cabbage, and all kinds of greens: collard greens, mustard greens, turnip tops, eggplants, and peppers.    Ms. Wikoff: And then where did you sell all of these?    Mr. Mocci: Chain stores, eventually. We did alright because we raised a lot of stuff so we could supply these chain stores.    Ms. Wikoff: How did you wash your vegetables?      Mr. Mocci washing peppers  Mr. Mocci: We used to wash peppers and wax them to take the water off. If we didn't take the water off they would go bad when you put it in cardboard boxes. So they went through a little waxer that took off all the water off. When we used to pack tomatoes, it was the same thing.    Ms. Wikoff: Wasn't that brand new in this area?    Mr. Mocci: Yes. We had a regular packing and then we had a vegetable dipper where we used to dip all the greens, like cabbage, spinach, broccoli, all that stuff, through ice water. We had refrigerator trucks, too.    Ms. Wikoff: And that was a new idea in this area, too, wasn't it?    Mr. Mocci: We went to the Philadelphia Market, we went to the Bronx Terminal Market, and we had Shop Rite buying it from us. We went to the Terminal Market in the Bronx, and when we raised a lot of rutabaga turnips, we went to Boston with them.    Ms. Wikoff: Isn't it too bad that the farmers today can't sell directly to local grocery stores? Now stores get it all from either California or Florida or some place.    Mr. Mocci: Now if you're going to sell direct, you've got to bring it to a warehouse where they divide it to all their stores. We don't deliver direct to the stores. We went to the warehouses. At one time then we had four refrigerator trucks.    Ms. Wikoff: You were big time for this area.    Mr. Mocci: We worked hard. One thing I can say, we never had a bad year, never. The drier it was, the better it was for us, because we had all the irrigation. We could irrigate one hundred fifty four acres. Every year we bought more pipes. The day we had the sale, they sold pipes for half a day, there were so many pipes there. When the pipes first came out they were galvanized, but then we went to aluminum pipes. They were man killers, those galvanized pipes. Even these aluminum pipes, when you had to move them, you had to get all the water out, and then when you were irrigating, if you had one bad move in a pipe, you would unhook the pipe and the thing would blow apart, and then you had to shut the whole system off to bring the pipes all back together.    Ms. Wikoff: I know what you're talking about. No fun.    Mr. Mocci: But, we did alright. As I said before, we never had a bad year. We always made money on the farm.    Ms. Wikoff: Maybe now you'd like to tell about the change from Marlboro over to- ?    Mr. Mocci: When we sold here in 1987, we bought the farm in Marlboro. Also, when we sold, my son went on to work with all those greenhouses, and they stayed there for three years. And then when the rent got too high there, we decided to build over where I had this little farm with twelve acres, but it took them a year and a half before we got variance form the township to go ahead and build. Then after three years we started here in 1990.    Ms. Wikoff: And then before that you had just rented the land that the Bayshore Hospital is now on?    Mr. Mocci: Oh, that was way back. At one time we worked one hundred and five acres in Holmdel and Hazlet. We had irrigation all the time. When it first came out, we started buying irrigation, because on sandy ground if you didn't have water, you couldn't raise anything.    Ms. Wikoff: Don't you have to get approvals to use the water from the state?    Mr. Mocci: At that time no, but now you do. We used to pump out of a pond here. In fact, I have two ponds. After a while the state came in and told you to put a meter on the pump. Quite a change.    Ms. Wikoff: You can tell us about your children building the building and getting into the retail business.    Mr. Mocci: Well, after we built this place, we started putting up greenhouses. The first greenhouse was a gutter house, and where the store was, there was another treat attached to the store. Right now my son has sixteen greenhouses, and he's got two more going up this year. It's so hard to go out and buy plants and sell, because it's nothing like the ones you raise. They may be different size pots. We generally sell everything in forty-eights. It's better to have all one-size pots. It's easier pricing.    Ms. Wikoff: How many children are involved in this business now?    Mr. Mocci: My son and his wife and my three grandchildren. My three grandchildren and I spend time there every day. In the springtime we have two men working right after New Year's. We start around January 20th. We're closed for two months, January and February, but we're still working. We start with hanging baskets. You have to start hanging baskets early because they take a long time. He raises about between five and six thousand hanging baskets. All the greenhouses are hooked up  all watering is automatic, and the spaghetti tube waters the pots. But there's no end to the work. He just keeps planting and planting and keeps on going.    Ms. Wikoff: You were an entrepreneur when you started the irrigation and now your family members are entrepreneurs using the greenhouses.    Mr. Mocci: They're doing very well.    Ms. Wikoff: So tell us about your family gatherings when you used to have a vineyard and you made wine. I imagine the family got together to do that.    Mr. Mocci: When my father was alive, he made the wine. And then I had a younger brother who got into making wine. I never bothered making wine once. When I was young, I got so drunk on wine that I couldn't drink it anymore. It made me very sick.    Ms. Wikoff: Tell us about canning tomatoes.    Mr. Mocci: Every year we can as a family. We can anywhere between three to four hundred jars a year, and we divide them. I think this year we made three hundred thirty seven jars in one day. We did sixteen bushels of tomatoes in one day, all hot packed.    Ms. Wikoff: Do you do it in your kitchen?    Mr. Mocci: The kitchen downstairs. Before you go home I'm going to take you downstairs and show you.    Ms. Wikoff: That takes a lot of big pots.    Mr. Mocci: A lot of big pots, and I've got a regular commercial tomato machine which sorts out the seeds and the skins. The tomatoes don't have any seeds or skins, it's pure tomatoes. The only thing we put in it is the basil and salt, and then we hot pack it. Years ago, when my mother used to can, we used to put the tomatoes in soda water bottles with a stick, and boil them in the tub outside.    Ms. Wikoff: We used to make ketchup, but that took so long, because you know you had to cook it down until it was thick. It never was as thick as the commercial ketchup you get today. Do you remember, it was a little bit runny.    Mr. Mocci: I have to tell you a little story about my father when he was farming. There was a ketchup factory in Hazlet, and in fact the smokestack is still there. It's like a monument there. I used to go there with my father with the horses to bring our cheese peppers there. Cheese pepper gave the tomatoes color, because the tomatoes didn't have a real good red color, and the cheese peppers used to be real dark red. That's why my father used to raise cheese peppers. They would mix them with tomatoes to give the tomatoes more color. That's a good many years ago.    Ms. Wikoff: Well, I'm going to bring you back to not so many years ago. You got an award from the Monmouth County Board of Agriculture for your achievements in agriculture in 1986. Congratulations! You probably had your family come to dinner that night. And your daughter Carol won an award recently. Well, she was chosen to be an outstanding teacher as I understand it.    Mr. Mocci: Yes, outstanding teacher of the year.    Ms. Wikoff: And where does she teach?    Mr. Mocci: Indian Hill School in Holmdel.    Ms. Wikoff: On this big bulletin board it says "Congratulations, Frank Mocci. Sixty years of Hazlet Fire Volunteer."    Mr. Mocci: In another year it will be sixty-five years. That was four years ago. They'll have to put another one on there.    Ms. Wikoff: It goes on to say about sixty years of friendship and service with the Hazlet Fire Company. Well, that's a long time. They really appreciated you all those years.    Mr. Mocci: When Carol got her award, they had opened up the new school.     Mrs. Mocci: There were two teachers who started there as students in the first grade, graduated, and now they're teaching at the same school. That's Indian Hill.     Mr. Mocci: She and two other teachers were there to cut the ribbon when they started that school, and now they teach there. My daughter has been teaching for over fifteen years there.    Ms. Wikoff: You can be proud of all the accomplishments of you and your family. Is there anything else that you'd like to tell us about farming and how it's changed? What tractors did you use?    Mr. Mocci: We had Ford tractors,  and John Deere tractors. At one time we had twenty-four tractors. We used to raise eggplants. There was a cannery in Brooklyn that used to buy five hundred bushels. We used to put five hundred and ten bushels of eggplant on a truck, and they used to can these eggplants with vinegar at the cannery.    Ms. Wikoff: I never bought canned eggplant.    Mr. Mocci: These were pickled eggplants. But this company packed just eggplants for two or three weeks, and then it would be hot peppers, or green peppers.    Ms. Wikoff: Have you ever eaten pickled eggplant?    Mr. Mocci: Oh, yes, we used to make them here. But it takes a lot of eggplants because they have to peel an eggplant and cut it up and put them in the vinegar, then they have to press it. When you get done pressing eggplant, there isn't too much left.    Ms. Wikoff: A black juice comes out. We would make a layer of eggplant and put some salt on it and then put an iron on the layers to get the juices.    Mr. Mocci: Well, you know something about Italian eggplant.    Ms. Wikoff: In my experience with gardening it's one of the hardest things to grow because of the bugs that get on them.    Mr. Mocci: Now that's all under control. They don't have any more bugs on eggplant.  I've seen a lot of big changes in Holmdel, yes.  I remember when Holmdel was all potatoes and corn.  Everybody had to go to Dan Ely to buy horses. We used to freight the horses, they'd come down in Hazlet, and we'd take them off the cars and they'd walk them up, at that time it was all gravel, no pavement, they used to walk them up, they used to tie the tails and walk twenty five, thirty horses up -    Ms. Wikoff: Tie the tails?    Mr. Mocci: To the halter, you know. And they used to follow one another, no problem.    Ms. Wikoff: And would you bid for them?    Mr. Mocci: No, you'd buy the team of horses. He was a real horse dealer. You'd buy a team of horses, if you didn't like that team, you'd bring them back and you'd get another team with maybe fifty or a hundred dollars more. You'd do this until you got a good team of horses.    Ms. Wikoff: They always had to be a real pair that worked well together.    Mr. Mocci: That's right. When I was a kid we had eight horses. Four horses used to work in the morning and another four horses worked in the afternoon. I used to follow the horses barefoot.    Ms. Wikoff: Do you have any stories that you tell the children?    Mr. Mocci: They ask for a lot of stories. My son Joe was my right hand. He was the backbone of the ground up there in Holmdel. I did all the spraying out there, but now he knows more about spraying than I do, just by, you know, being my son.    Ms. Wikoff: Well, now you have to have a pesticide license to be able to spray, and you have to go in the winter and take a course.    Mr. Mocci: I just got my license for another five years, and I don't need it. We go to these meetings. We'd go to meetings in Asbury and Atlantic City for two, three days when they had the farm shows there. Whenever you go to a meeting you get points. I just got my license for another five years. The only time I use it is if I have to go pick up some pesticide. You have to have a license to do that.    Ms. Wikoff: Do you have a deer problem where you are now?    Mr. Mocci: No, we don't have a deer problem. The only thing we have a problem with is the geese. You know we don't have that much ground here, and the geese come along and pull out the little bit of ground that you plant.    Ms. Wikoff: We have squirrels as a problem, and the geese now are a terrible problem on golf courses, too. There's a new business that's developed: people raise border collies, and the golf course hires their border collie to come and chase the geese off! We saw this one time.    Mr. Mocci: We had a lot of greenhouses. At one time we had seven hundred sashes. In fact we still have a few hundred more now.     Ms. Wikoff: Well, those glass sashes were very difficult to keep, weren't they?     Mr. Mocci: Every year we always had these couple of men in the wintertime just to keep the sashes. Every year they'd repair sash, and paint maybe a hundred, hundred fifty sashes, because when you've got seven hundred sashes it would take you five or six years to do them all, so you do maybe a hundred at a time.    Ms. Wikoff: Well, we're so happy that you've been so successful as a vegetable farmer.    Mr. Mocci: Thank God.    Ms. Wikoff: We want you and Rose to stay well and enjoy the rewards of your hard work. This has been a very nice interview and we thank you again.    Mr. Mocci: I've been very glad to sit down and talk to you about this.       
MonmouthCounty;Frances Donowitz;xxxx;1999;Frances Donowitz, xxxx, 1999    Remembering the 20th Century: An Oral History of Monmouth County   Frances Donowitz and her husband, Saul   Date of Interview:  December 22, 1999  Name of Interviewer:  Lauren Ordene  Premises of Interview:  Ms. Donowitz's home, Manalapan, NJ Birth date of Subject:  N/A    Ms. Ordene: Can you tell me a little bit about how you ended up here and why you came to live in Monmouth County?  Ms. Donowitz: I am a Canadian, but I was not born there.  I was born in Russia, but we immigrated to Canada and I went to school there.  Then I got married and that's how I came here.  Ms. Ordene: Did your husband have any affiliations to this area, or did you just happen to move here?  Frances and Saul Donowitz on their wedding day   Ms. Donowitz: No, he was born in Russia also, and then he moved to Canada.  He then moved to New York and then sort of remembered me and we got married.  That's how I came to Monmouth County.  Ms. Ordene: Oh, that's wonderful. When you first arrived here what were your impressions? Were you happy that you came?  Ms. Donowitz: No, I was not happy because there was nothing here except the potato farm, fields and fields, and it was just very discouraging.  I used to run to New York several times a week just to get myself sort of in action, so that I wouldn't be so unhappy, but it took many years for me to get used to this kind of life.  Of course, our libraries were not the best in those days, so it took quite a number of years for me to get adjusted to it.  Of course, I soon had children and I got so busy that I concentrated on bringing them up.  Ms. Ordene: That's great. When did you move from Russia?  Ms. Donowitz: In 1939.  Ms. Ordene: So you were there for a little while when you were growing up.  Ms. Donowitz: Oh yes.  We lived under the most difficult conditions and we were delighted to get out.  We were the last ones to get out of Russia after we got our passports.  They closed the quota, so nobody could get out for years, and then of course the war was there.  And I guess we would've all been killed, but my mother was quite a strong and courageous women.  When we got our passports, they announced that they closed the quota and nobody could leave.  But she said, "I'm going to take a chance.  I'll call there anyway."  Just like that, she went there all by herself.  My father did not go, and they gave it to her, and she was the last one to get it.  And then at night we just went.  We took a train and got out of Russia, and my kids and my grandchildren think that we saved the whole family because we would have all been killed.  We feel very, very fortunate.  Ms. Ordene: Did you have family that was still there that didn't come to Canada?  Ms. Donowitz: Oh yes, many people who lived there.  Ms. Ordene: So were they killed?  Ms. Donowitz: We never heard from them again.  Ms. Ordene: So they could be living somewhere right now.  Ms. Donowitz: They could be, but I think they probably would remember our name  and you know with e-mail now they probably could get in touch with us.  Ms. Ordene: So you came to America after living in Canada.  Ms. Donowitz: Yes, that's right.  After I graduated high school, I got married.  Ms. Ordene: I hear that you and your husband began a chicken farm when you came here.  Ms. Donowitz: Right, we still have the coops down here. My husband passed away a couple of years ago so I run the farm now.  Ms. Ordene: Very good.  Ms. Donowitz: Well I don't know how good that is, but I'm in it and I can't get out of it.  Ms. Ordene: It takes courage to sustain something like that all by yourself.  When you had the chicken farm, did your children help you at all as they were growing up?  Ms. Donowitz: Well they really did not ...I never wanted them to be chicken farmers, so I discouraged that.  But, one year my eldest son, Mark, was home from college, and for the lack of anything better to do, my husband said, "Why don't you go on and help with the chickens?"  So he did, but he couldn't stand it.  He would go in the morning and pick up the eggs, and then run quickly and take a shower and then read his books and then go again and then come back and take another shower. So he scratched it off his list.  It wasn't the thing he wanted to do for the rest of his life.  Mark (left), Arlene, and Gerald, children of Frances and Saul Donowitz   Ms. Ordene: But they went to school in this area?  Ms. Donowitz: Oh yes, they all graduated from Freehold Regional High School.  My eldest son and my youngest son graduated from high school in Freehold.  One year they were rebuilding the school, so for that year my daughter went to the Township School.  Ms. Ordene: Is it the one that's currently there or was it rebuilt?  Ms. Donowitz: The one in Freehold Borough was rebuilt and they closed it during the rebuilding so all the students had to go to the Township School, and that's where she graduated.  Ms. Ordene: Did they like school here?  Ms. Donowitz: Oh they loved it.  They had honors classes in those days.  I don't know whether they have them now.  Ms. Ordene: They still do.  Ms. Donowitz: They liked it because they were always in honors classes. They enjoyed that very much.  The schools in Freehold were very good. You know, some people thought that they weren't, but they were very good.  Ms. Ordene: Were they the only Jewish children that went to the school, or were there others?  Ms. Donowitz: Oh no, there were many.  Ms. Ordene: Did you participate in any synagogue or religious service once you came, or were there no synagogues around here then?  Ms. Donowitz: Oh yes, I went to the synagogue.  Ms. Ordene: Where was the synagogue?  Ms. Donowitz: On Broad Street.  It's still there.  Ms. Ordene: On Broad Street in Freehold?  Were they Bar Mitzvahed there?  Ms. Donowitz: Yes. And my daughter Bat Mitzvahed, up there.  Ms. Ordene: That's wonderful. So when did you start getting involved in the public life in Monmouth County?  Ms. Donowitz: Maybe twenty-five years ago when my kids started using libraries and doing research. I decided that something had to be done. I went around Freehold getting petitions signed to improve the library.  I didn't have any trouble getting signatures because it was such a popular subject. So we collected about 5,000 signatures.  Ms. Ordene: Oh wow, that's pretty impressive. Were the petitions used to improve the library?  Ms. Donowitz: No.  They built the Eastern Branch Library, and then they promised to build one in western Monmouth County, but in the meantime, they forgot about it. Or the money ran out or whatever and so The Friends of the Monmouth County Library Association had to sort of start all over again in order to instigate it, so that's what we did.  Ms. Ordene: When did you become president?  Was that recently?  Ms. Donowitz: Yes.  It was maybe five years ago.  Ms. Ordene: Have you enjoyed it?  Ms. Donowitz: Oh, I love it. I really love it. I love the library and working with the people, they're just wonderful and so helpful.  Ms. Ordene: Was there a process when you were passing the petitions? Did you go door to door and walk around?  Ms. Donowitz: I went from door to door, and sometimes people would be scared to let me in, but they did anyway.  I didn't think I was so frightful.  And then I took the petitions over to one of the meetings at the Eastern Branch, and that's how it all started.  Ms. Ordene: That's great.  In terms of your chicken farm, how did you market the chickens and the eggs?  Ms. Donowitz: Well, during the war time we sold eggs to Fort Monmouth.  They had to be processed a certain way  they would not be accepted just any old way, and my husband was very good at it. I actually never worked on the farm.  I was too busy.  Ms. Ordene: Did you have to actually go down to Fort Monmouth?  Ms. Donowitz: No they would come and pick them up.  The only time I did work or manage the farm was when my husband went to work for the Department of Agriculture  then I took over.  Ms. Ordene: Was your husband working the chicken farm during the war?   Ms. Donowitz: I think he got a deferment because he was producing something for the soldiers.  He never went to war, but he did supply the army with the eggs.  Ms. Ordene: Could you name a few things in the past since you've lived here, or perhaps while your children were growing up, that you can recall doing that was fun?  Ms. Donowitz: Well, it was always fun here because there wasn't much to do in the town.  The children developed very good friends and played with other children.  It was sincerely fun  they enjoyed it and loved it.  And  we would always go to Montreal for excitement because my family lives there and they're still there.  The children really enjoyed growing up here  they have very good memories.  It wasn't exciting, but it encouraged them to read a lot and to create their own excitement and have many good friends. The only thing I had to do was transport them, bringing their friends here, bringing the friends there.  Ms. Ordene: You were the car pool mom.  Ms. Donowitz: Yes, well, you know.  Of course they went to school in Freehold, so they were tuition pupils all the time. They were supposed to go to a one-room school house in Millhurst.  Ms. Ordene: That was still in working order--the one room school house?  Ms. Donowitz: When they were going to school it was. It isn't now, and but they then were always tuition pupils in Freehold. So I always had to drive them until they went to high school.  Ms. Ordene: Did you have your house built, or was it here when you got here?  Ms. Donowitz: Yes, we built it ourselves right on Route 33, and then they decided to put a ramp over there, so the house was moved.  Ms. Ordene: How did they go about that one?  Ms. Donowitz: We lived in it during the whole moving process.  Ms. Ordene: As they were moving it?  Ms. Donowitz: Yes, as they were moving it.  They put it on huge airplane wheels, and then they slowly moved it back and we lived in it all the time.  Ms. Ordene: So the town moved it for you?  Ms. Donowitz: No, we had special movers.  They cut our land in half. The new Route 33 also was a part of our farm, so we have acreage on this side of Route 33 and across Route 33.  Ms. Ordene: Are there any places in Monmouth County that that you really take pride in?  For example, the library?  Ms. Donowitz: Oh yes!  The library of course is the most important thing, because a place without a library is not very impressive.  The library is right up with the schools.  I really think the schools were great.  Ms. Ordene: Do you still think that the schools are great?  What do you think of all the things that are going on now in terms of the school system?  Ms. Donowitz: Well you know I certainly don't approve of them.   I think there is no place in schools for violence, but in those days the schools were wonderful.  The kids made many friends and had all kinds of activities, and I still think the schools are great.  Ms. Ordene: Obviously Monmouth County has changed a lot since you've been here.  Ms. Donowitz: Oh, absolutely it has.  It became, I think, more like New York.  Ms. Ordene: You don't have to go there for the action anymore.  Ms. Donowitz: I don't have to go back to New York, because it is like Freehold.  When people discover Freehold, they love it and they want to move out here.  Ms. Ordene: What was the extent of your schooling when you were growing up?  Ms. Donowitz: High School, and I had one year of business education.  Ms. Ordene: How did you find growing up as a women?  Did you encounter any problems or any obstacles?  Ms. Donowitz: Well, I'm not a career woman, but I know that women have a very difficult time.  Even when my daughter went to medical school, some of the students there thought that she should not be there and that she should get married and stay home. She had different ideas.  Ms. Ordene: Where did you go to business school?  Ms. Donowitz: In Montreal.  Ms. Ordene: Do you have a hero?  Ms. Donowitz: Eleanor Roosevelt to me is a hero, because she had so many obstacles to overcome.  I think Franklin Roosevelt was a hero too, because he was handicapped, and even so he did so much for so many people.  Ms. Ordene: How were you affected by prohibition?  Did you see any effects of the ban of alcohol while it was going on?   Ms. Donowitz: Well, I was not affected because I never drank.  Ms. Ordene:  What was your favorite music, for example?  Ms. Donowitz: I really like classical music and I like Garth Brooks.  Ms. Ordene: Garth Brooks the country singer?  Ms. Donowitz: Yes, I really like him, because I like his philosophy on life.  Ms. Ordene: Why is that?  Ms. Donowitz: Well, he does a lot of good.  He gives money away to charity and he's involved with different things, and I like that.  It's not only making money. He's interested in what he's doing.  Ms. Ordene: How were you affected by the issues of segregation and black rights growing up?  Ms. Donowitz: Well, of course, I'm delighted that they are getting what they deserve: more freedom and equal treatment.  But, you know, I never discriminated.  We always had black people working for us, and they were always our friends, and they weren't any different.  They're just human beings.  Ms. Ordene: Did you see or witness any discrimination against minorities that discouraged you in this area?  Ms. Donowitz: I'm sure there was.  It's just that when they came to the farm or they helped me in the house, they were just treated as one of the family.  And my husband helped them whenever he could and they're still my friends.  Sometimes I go to Freehold and I hear someone say, "Hi, Frances," and I see that they have grown up.  I say, "Do I know you?" They say, "Yes I worked on your farm."  Ms. Ordene: It must have been startling to you.  Ms. Donowitz: I like the idea that they call me Frances.  Ms. Ordene: What are your hobbies?  Ms. Donowitz: Well, I love to read.  Ms. Ordene: What is your favorite book?  Ms. Donowitz: I have so many.  Ms. Ordene: Right now.  Ms. Donowitz: I love Russell, anything by Russell.  Ms. Ordene:  Do you like to cook?  Ms. Donowitz: Well, I'd rather bake.  Ms. Ordene: You like baking cookies for example?  Ms. Donowitz: Oh yes, I like to bake.  I entertain a lot and I like to bake, but cooking is not my favorite thing.  Ms. Ordene: So what is your favorite thing to bake?  Ms. Donowitz: Well, I bake cookies and cakes and different things.  Ms. Ordene: I've heard about your famous soup recipe.   Ms. Donowitz: Oh yes, I do like eating vegetarian, purely vegetarian.  Ms. Ordene: Would you like to share the recipe for that on tape?  Ms. Donowitz: Well, I would if I knew exactly.  I just put in all the vegetables I have.  Its just pure vegetables, no fats and no meat,  just pure vegetables.  I'm glad that I have people who appreciate it. It's so much fun to do when somebody likes it, really.  Ms. Ordene: Do you still participate in the synagogue?   Ms. Donowitz: No.  Although I do belong to different organizations, you know, Hadassah and The Workman's Circle, and a few others. I belonged to it for so many years.  Ms. Ordene: Do you participate in activities through them or is it more of a ceremonial type of thing?  Ms. Donowitz: Only if I can get to it. It is difficult for me to get around.  Ms. Ordene: All right, let's get philosophical here. If you could choose a symbol for your life what would it be?  Ms. Donowitz: A symbol for my life-- to help other people.  Young people, especially.  Ms. Ordene: Through the library and things like that. Are their any other avenues through which you helped people over the years?  Ms. Donowitz: I like to help people if they have difficulties.  I just like to help them.  Their life should be a little easier.  Ms. Ordene: Have you been involved at all in the arts?  Ms. Donowitz: Only in that I appreciate them.  I love museums and I love art.  We've worked hard for the arts at the library, like the statues there now.  We donated them to the library.  We have had fundraisers for maybe more than ten years, to which I donate money because the artwork was were so expensive.  Ms. Ordene: Is there something that you still want to accomplish in your life?  Ms. Donowitz: Well, I do want to see my grandchildren become something very special.  Ms. Ordene: How old are they?  Ms. Donowitz: Well, one is twenty-nine, one is twenty-six, one is twenty-one, and one is nineteen.  Ms. Ordene: Do they live in the area?  Ms. Donowitz: No.  Ms. Ordene: Where do they live?  Ms. Donowitz: One is in Boston, one is in India right now, and the other two are in Charlottesville, Virginia.  Ms. Ordene: How did your grandchild end up in India?  Ms. Donowitz: Well, he is interested in Tibet, and he likes to travel.  He wants to become an international lawyer.  So, now that he has gotten into law school, he is going to look around and see what he is interested in.  Ms. Ordene: That's great.  Did he go to Freehold Township High School?  Ms. Donowitz: No, he is from Boston and Baltimore, so he went to school there.  He went to private schools and he graduated from the University of Wisconsin.  Ms. Ordene: What places have you traveled to?  Ms. Donowitz: Well, you know I lived in Russia.  Ms. Ordene: Have you gone there since?  Ms. Donowitz: No, I have not gone there, but I have traveled through Canada, and part of the United States.  Ms. Ordene: So your ancestors all came from Russia?  Ms. Donowitz: Yes, they're all from Russia.  Ms. Ordene: Were you affected as a Jew in Russia?  Ms. Donowitz: Oh, absolutely yes.  There was a lot of anti-Semitism in Russia, and as I understand, there still is.  That's one of the reasons I have never gone back there.  My childhood was not that happy there, so I never wanted to go back.  Ms. Ordene: Did you encounter a lot of prejudice and things like that?  Ms. Donowitz: Oh, yes, absolutely.  They had something else which was even worse than anti-Semitism  you had to belong to the Communist Party if you wanted to have a good job, and if you didn't want to belong to the Party, you were just rejected.  Ms. Ordene: What were your parents' occupations?  Ms. Donowitz: Well, my father had a lumberyard and he was considered to be a capitalist, thus he was not treated very well.  I think because he was a capitalist, they were looking for him and were going to send him to Siberia.  But in the meantime, we had to do something, so we disappeared.  Ms. Ordene: You could've been in some serious trouble then.  Ms. Donowitz: Yes, we would have been, because they didn't like people going distances.  Ms. Ordene: So, when you were leaving Russia, did you go through Europe?   Ms. Donowitz: Well, we went through Riga, Latvia.  Then we landed in Le Havre, France, because our papers were not completely correct.  We had to be there for quite a number of months, and we stayed in Paris, I think, for six months.  Ms. Ordene:  Did you learn French?  Ms. Donowitz: Yes, we learned French.  My brother and I would go to the Louvre  everyday and every evening  we knew Paris before we were finally able to leave.  Ms. Ordene: Do you remember what year you were in France?  Ms. Donowitz: In 1940.  Ms. Ordene: So things were already heating up in the war then.  Ms. Donowitz: Oh yes, we left just before.  Ms. Ordene: Was it scary?  Ms. Donowitz: Oh yes, it was really scary.  You could tell the tension, and we knew we had to get out.  Ms. Ordene:  Is there any other historical event  in Monmouth County you would recall as being significant?  Ms. Donowitz: It was just horrible to know that so many people were getting killed all over the world.  It wasn't peaceful because when you see all the people suffer, you yourself don't enjoy life that much.  We were glad when it was all over.  Ms. Ordene: And how about more recently?  Ms. Donowitz: Well, with all the tension in Kosovo or with Adolph, and all that sort of thing, you feel it dreadfully.  Ms. Ordene: Do you know how long the hospital has been here?    Ms. Donowitz: Yes, probably fifteen or twenty years.  Ms. Ordene: What was here before that? What was the medical facility before that?  Ms. Donowitz: Well, the nearest hospital was Jersey Shore Medical Center, I think, or Monmouth Medical Center. That's where my kids were born--in Jersey Shore-- so it's nice to have a hospital closer.  Ms. Ordene:  Was there a local doctor that you would go to, other than going to the Jersey Shore?  Ms. Donowitz: Well, actually, we had a family doctor.  Ms. Ordene: Do your children live in Monmouth County?  Ms. Donowitz: My children do not live in Monmouth County.  They lived here while growing up, but when they got their education, they never lived here.  So they never practiced here, but I use them. I feel they know me well.  So they help me by telephone.  Ms. Ordene: Is there anything that you expected the future to bring that may have happened or that did not happen?  Ms. Donowitz: It happened beyond my expectation.  With all the different technologies and computers and Internet and e-mail, it's beyond anyone's imagination.  I think it's wonderful to live with this.  And I imagine, the next century is going to be even better.  Ms. Ordene:  The next century is coming up, isn't it?  What would you say are the milestones in your life?  Frances and Saul Donowitz with their three children   Ms. Donowitz: Well I think the greatest accomplishments are really my children. They have accomplished so much, and I am deeply grateful, because they did it on their own.  I'm very proud of them. And the nicest part about it is that they do so much good.  They do a lot of good and they go out of their way to do it, and for that I'm very grateful.  Ms. Ordene: Is there any part of your life that you would want to relive?  Ms. Donowitz: No.  I would not like to relive anything.  It was wonderful going through that, but then I look forward to something even better, so anticipation is there.  Ms. Ordene: Are you doing anything special for New Years?  Ms. Donowitz: Well, my kids are going to be here.  Ms. Ordene: You're going to have a New Year celebration together?  Ms. Donowitz: Yes.  They're all getting older too, but traveling is not going to be that great, so they're going to be around.  Ms. Ordene: Is there any story or song or anything that has been passed down, maybe through your family through the generations, that you still have?  Ms. Donowitz: Well not so much song, but the philosophy of their life.  How they lived was always best: do good, don't be mean, do your best, have honesty and truthfulness.  Don't be greedy.  Money doesn't mean anything.  Ms. Ordene: What advice would you give to the present or future generations from all the experiences that you've had?  Ms. Donowitz: I would tell them to get their education, the best education they can get, because this world is for educated people. The more education you have, the better this world will be.  Ms. Ordene: What are your feelings now that we're entering the millennium? What do you think about all the terrorism and all the press?    Ms. Donowitz: Oh yes, yes.  Well, I think it's horrible, and I think the year 2000 will be much better, because people realize that violence and terrorism do not do anyone any good. I think its going to be much better in 2000.  Ms. Ordene: I see that you have this map of the United States in your kitchen.  Ms. Donowitz: I have two, one of the United States, and one of the world in the other room, because the kids travel so much that I just want to know where they are.  Ms. Ordene: So you point it out and figure out where they are.  Ms. Donowitz: I wear out the maps by them traveling. And my daughter sent that one to me, because she said the other one was just so torn. She said, "You have to see where we are."  Ms. Ordene: During the summer, did you ever go to the shore when you were living here?   Ms. Donowitz: Oh, yes.  I used to take the kids, too. In those days, many years ago, we used Rockafeld Park in Lakewood.  I think it was renamed Ocean County Park.  They have a little lake, and we would picnic there and swim and so on.  And then, of course, we always used the shore.  The shore is beautiful.  Ms. Ordene: Was that your main summer activity?  Ms. Donowitz: No, we would travel to Canada.  Ms. Ordene: Where in Canada did you go? Did you go mainly to Montreal?  Ms. Donowitz: Yes.  Because my family was there and the kids were so excited about a big metropolitan city, we would just stay there.  They loved the trolleys, the street cars, and they would ride them.  Ms. Ordene: Did they learn French because of that?  Ms. Donowitz: Well, I doubt that they learned French, but they loved the city. They know the city pretty well.  Ms. Ordene: Did they learn any languages when they were in school in Monmouth County?  Ms. Donowitz: Yes.  German and Latin.  Ms. Ordene: I don't think they have Latin anymore in the schools.  Ms. Donowitz: I don't think so, but in those days I think you either took Latin or German for medical school.  Ms. Ordene: Now they have French and Spanish.  Ms. Donowitz: Oh well, that's good.  Ms. Ordene: Have you ever been to Israel or England?  Ms. Donowitz: No, France.  Ms. Ordene: Have you gone back to France since you were staying there?  Ms. Donowitz: No.  Ms. Ordene: What was your most recent vacation?  Ms. Donowitz: Hawaii.  We stayed in Maui.  We went in a submarine and then helicopters that went into the craters.  Ms. Ordene: Did you love it?  Ms. Donowitz: Oh, I love Hawaii.  I tell you, it's paradise on earth.  Ms. Ordene: Did you ever attend Manalapan Day?   Ms. Donowitz: Oh, yes.  I went and helped the library a little bit, because they always have the exhibits there.  I love the park.  That's where all the kids played.  We lived across the street right in the house connected to the park, and of course they always played there. So that park means a great deal to us.  Ms. Ordene: So are you also a member of the Friends of Battlefield Park?  Ms. Donowitz: Yes I am.  It's a very historical place, where they had the Battle of Monmouth.  Ms. Ordene: Have you ever gone to the re-enactment of the Battle?  Ms. Donowitz: Oh yes, I always do.  It's really fun, and of course the kids always played in the park, so it means so much.  I still go walking there.  And when the kids come here, they jog there.  That park is really a part of us.  Ms. Ordene: Would you like to comment on the political process, or how it's changed?  Have you been involved in the local government at all?  Ms. Donowitz: Well, I'm not involved in it, but I think in Monmouth County they have done a great job.  I really like what the Freeholders are doing.  They're very supportive, and I think they're doing a great job.  Monmouth County is doing well and is prosperous and has some good people.  Ms. Ordene: They've renovated that old Inn that's near the hospital, and also there's another historic house that they're moving that's right across the street from the hospital  are you familiar with either of these houses?  Ms. Donowitz: Well, I'm familiar in that it belongs to Bernard D. Hochberg.  He went to school with my eldest son Mark.  I understand they're going to make it the historical shopping area.  I don't know, though.  The owner is a very good businessman.  He wants to make something interesting of it, so I'm looking forward to it.  Ms. Ordene: You were still living in your house when they were moving it  you were actually inside your house?   Ms. Donowitz: Yes, we never got out of it. And, you know, we left all the glasses in it.  Ms. Ordene: Nothing broke?  Ms. Donowitz: Nothing.  They did a very good job.  Ms. Ordene: That must have been funny, just sitting in your house while it's moving.  Ms. Donowitz: However, I was glad the kids were all out. They were all in college. So that was good.  Ms. Ordene: You said that your grandson went to the University of Wisconsin.  Where did your children go?  Ms. Donowitz: Both of my sons went to Brandeis.  My daughter went to the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.  She went to George Washington Medical School. My eldest son went to Johns Hopkins Medical School, and my younger one went to Pennsylvania Medical School.    Ms. Ordene: They're all pretty smart kids.  They went to some pretty good schools. I hear that your daughter has an airplane.  Ms. Donowitz: Yes, she does.  She's got a long distance flying license, and her husband does too.  Ms. Ordene: Okay, I want to ask you, how do ordinary citizens affect change in this area?  Ms. Donowitz: Well, I think if you decide what you would like to have done in the county, you go to the Freeholder meetings and sometimes there is a special day on which you can speak out and can tell them what you would like to have done.  For example, we wanted to have the library built, and we went practically every week to the meetings, and they were so tired of seeing us.  I think they built the library just to get rid of us, because we were just sort of annoying them. But we would not go away, and now I'm sure they're very happy that they built it, because it's just the greatest thing in this county.  It's just wonderful.  Ms. Ordene: Did you take part in the library once it was built?  Frances Donowitz and Bart Walter at the dedication of a statue now located at the Monmouth County Library Headquarters   Ms. Donowitz: I don't work for the library, I just belong to The Friends of Monmouth County Library Association, and help the library in whatever they would like us to help them with.  We don't run the library. We have nothing to do with the library except helping them. We don't work for the library. It's very important to know that. We're just there to help them and get things that they can not get from the county budget.  Ms. Ordene: Have you ever met anyone famous, maybe a political figure, or somebody that's in Hollywood, or somebody you know in the music industry, maybe Bruce Springsteen or someone like that?    Ms. Donowitz: Well, actually when Itzhak Perlman, the violinist, was very young, around thirteen, he played in Lakewood High School, and I did meet him.  Ms. Ordene: Wow.  Did you speak to him?  Ms. Donowitz: Well, briefly, and I'm sure he would not remember me. But I do remember him, because he was so good. Of course he was a little boy playing so beautifully under such difficulties.  I was very impressed by him.  Ms. Ordene: Was he famous at that point?  Ms. Donowitz: Well, he wasn't as famous as he is now.  He just was beginning his career.  Ms. Ordene: I just wanted to thank you for letting me interview you today.   Ms. Donowitz: You asked many intelligent questions.  Thank you for including me.  
MonmouthCounty;Eugene Dente;1908;2000;Eugene Dente, 1908, 2000        Remembering The 20th Century: An Oral History of Monmouth County      Mr. Eugene Dente as a special police officer for Long Branch, 1970    Date of Interview: June 19, 2000    Name of Interviewer: June E. West  Premises of Interview: Mr. Dente's home, West Long Branch, NJ   Birthdate of Subject: August 1, 1908  Deceased: June 13, 2003    Ms. West: Mr. Dente was affiliated with the INS, the Immigration and Naturalization Service, in Ellis Island, New York, from 1934 to 1941. He was also affiliated with Fort Monmouth from 1942 to 1972. He held the position of Interpreter of French, Italian, and Spanish languages for the INS, and he was an Electronic Technician at Fort Monmouth. Mr. Dente, when did you first come to Monmouth County?    Mr. Dente: I came here May 22, 1942, and America was at war with the Axis nations. I came here for employment at Evans Signal Laboratory, as it was known at that time. It was one of three satellites under the command of Fort Monmouth, New Jersey. The other two satellites were Coles Signal Laboratory, Squire Laboratory, which was located in Fort Monmouth itself, and Eatontown Signal Laboratory, which had to do with weather conditions and things of that sort. When I came here in 1942 to accept employment at the Signal Laboratory, Monmouth County was not as large in population as it is today. Evans Signal Laboratory at first was the headquarters of the Marconi Wireless Telegraph. It was a receiving station because of a strategic situation. I believe there are still towers in that area. Then it was sold, and part of it became a Ku Klux Klan installation in King's College. It was a Ku Klux Klan area known as Hiram Park. Then the government purchased the land to conduct radar experiments. This was a very integral part of World War II, contributing many factors to the War in personnel and equipment. Camp Evans, at that time when I came to work, was nothing but a mud hole. It was all just dying. They needed help in such a bad way that they recruited almost every man who knew anything about radio. Ham operators were hired right from the street because of the urgency of the situation. Camp Evans played a very, very important part in the welfare of the War, developing many experiments. The last of these experiments was the contact with the moon. After the War ended, one of the colonels associated with the labs had permission to experiment with contacting the moon. It was called the Diane Project. The importance of this affair was that it went through the outer sphere, therefore making it possible for space programs later on. There were many scientists at Fort Monmouth and also at Evans Signal Laboratory, as it was known at that time.    Ms. West: You have mentioned Fort Monmouth and Camp Evans. Could you tell us where Fort Monmouth is located?    Mr. Dente: Fort Monmouth is located in the area of Eatontown, Little Silver and New Shrewsbury (now Tinton Falls (ed.)), between Highway 35 and Oceanport Avenue. Fort Monmouth, incidentally, was the home of the United States Air Force. They had no room to put the planes after World War I, so they made the installation at Fort Monmouth the headquarters for the United States Air Force. That you might say was the birthplace of the United States Air Force.    Ms. West: Where was Camp Evans located?    Mr. Dente: Camp Evans was located in Wall Township by the Shark River Hills. It's located a few miles from Belmar, I believe on Belmar Boulevard. It was a beautiful place at that time, all countryside. There were no houses there as there are today. Gradually it became very famous with the developments of many factors contributing to the War effort. Towards the end of the War, there were many German scientists who were caught in the Operation Paperclip. They came over and did their part in contributing to the War effort. Camp Evans I believe also had something to do with the experiment of laser. We did have some dealings there. Later on, after the end of the War, the Hexagon was built in Eatontown, New Jersey.    Ms. West: What is the Hexagon?    Mr. Dente: The Hexagon was a large building built to consolidate all the laboratories. Most of Evans, Squire Lab, and Eatontown Lab were all consolidated into this Hexagon building located at Eatontown, on the outskirts of Tinton Falls, which at that time was known as New Shrewsbury.    Ms. West: What type of laboratories are we referring to?    Mr. Dente: I am referring to the Coles Signal Laboratory and the Eatontown Laboratory, which had to do with forecasting weather conditions. But Evans still was active for awhile. During the War, the United States Air Force became very large and productive. They wanted a laboratory of their own, so the Air Force chose as its laboratory an area in Rome, New York. All the laboratories associated with Fort Monmouth were instructed to give up some of the key personnel so that they could form a laboratory exclusively for the U.S. Air Force. I believe that laboratory is still in existence in Rome, New York. And let me say something about the conditions of Monmouth County when I came here. Monmouth County was a very, very beautiful county at that time. Highway 35 at that time was just a two or three-lane highway. In order to pass, you took your life in your hands because it was so small. Highway 34, which ran from the Amboys down through Monmouth County, was a two-lane highway. There again, you had to be very, very careful. During the War, in the midst of the War, the U.S. Navy acquired a site off Highway 34, which was called Earle Ammunition Depot at that time. It was for the purpose of storing ammunition. It was a very huge undertaking. Then they built a pier at Leonardo, New Jersey. And many, many homes had to be displaced because the government took them over to build the road from Earle Depot to this pier at Leonardo. That pier extended into the Raritan River. It was about a mile long, and there they loaded ammunition on Navy ships to keep the Navy supplied with ammunition. It was a real hardship for the many people who had to give up their homes. And in those days, homes were very, very scarce because of the shortage. It created a very acute situation.    Ms. West: Area-wise, you say homes and things were scarce. How else was the area at that time?    Mr. Dente: The area at that time was a wooded area, but there were quite a few homes in Middletown that had to be absorbed by the government so they could build that road from Earle Depot. They were near Delicious Orchards, and I forget exactly what town was located there. Now it's Colts Neck, I believe. They built storehouses for the ammunition. And people were afraid that they may have stored nuclear warheads. But we were told not to worry by the War Department, as it was known at that time. They built many storage areas, and people were quite afraid. And at one time, they did have a fire in Leonardo, I believe. People became rather alarmed for fear that some nuclear warheads might go off. But fortunately, nothing happened at that time. And let me say something about Monmouth County itself. Monmouth County was a very beautiful county at that time. It wasn't as populated as it is today. I would say Monmouth County at that time had a population of about 200,000 offhand, and that's pure conjecture.    Ms. West: When you say "at that time," what year are we speaking of?    Mr. Dente: I am speaking of 1942 to until the Garden State Parkway was built in the 1950s. Then the Garden State Parkway played a large part in the growth of Monmouth and Ocean counties. It opened the way and relieved the traffic. In order to get to New York, you had to go through Highway 34 or 35 and over the bridge at Perth Amboy. And the traffic was very, very slow and even hazardous.    Ms. West: Hazardous back then? There weren't as many cars as there are on the road today?    Mr. Dente: There weren't that many cars, but there were a lot of cars going home at night. To get across the bridge over the Raritan River, it was just a matter of stop-and-go. The Parkway somewhat relieved that congestion.    Ms. West: You mentioned many cars going home. They were going home from where?    Mr. Dente: Going home from the shore. They had come down to the shore, which was an attraction for the people from New York and upper New Jersey. The water at that time was pure. As a matter of fact at the Long Branch Pier, before it burned down, you would be afraid to dive into the water because it was so clear you thought you would hit bottom. But it was deep. But unfortunately the Pier burnt down several years ago, and it's no longer in existence. But Monmouth County consisted of many, many farms at that time. Mostly they were tomato farms. I am not saying this as an exaggeration, but I lived in Red Bank back then. In order to get to work from Red Bank to Camp Evans, we had to go down through Highway 35, and sometimes Highway 34. Now from Eatontown, past Eatontown and Broadway, there was a building on the left-hand side called Moulin Rouge. It was a café and sort of a hang-out for GIs at Fort Monmouth. And there was a motel across the street, Gloria's Motel. Those were the only buildings on Highway 35 until you came to Deal Road. If your car broke down, it would take two hours before another car came along. And I'm not exaggerating! That's true. The other side of Highway 35, from Eatontown all the way down to Deal Road, there was a large tomato farm. All that area, which is now built up, was wooded. And there was a big tomato farm. The name of it was Johern, for some reason. Where the Monmouth Mall is now located, there was a farm by the Eatontown Circle. It was the Davis farm, and that land went begging for quite some time. At Thanksgiving time and Christmas time, you could buy one of their turkeys. They had a turkey stand right there past the Circle. But that didn't remain there for long when that area was bought to put up that mall.    Ms. West: Do you recall what year that was?    Mr. Dente: Oh yes, that was about the late 1950s or into the 1960s. Then of course, they built the entrance to the Parkway into Eatontown Circle and then across Highway 35 and on towards the ocean.    Ms. West: Let's digress a little bit. When you first came to Monmouth County in 1942, where did you live?    Mr. Dente: At first, because of the War and the development of Evans Signal Laboratory, there were not enough buildings going up in Evans. So Fort Monmouth had an agreement with the War Department to use Sandy Hook for some of its buildings to conduct their radar experiments.    Ms. West: And were you married at this time?    Mr. Dente: Oh yes, I was married in 1933 in New York, in Staten Island.    Ms. West: So this is where your family lived?    Mr. Dente: Believe it or not, we were married ten years and had no children. When I came to New Jersey for this job, it was like being paid for a vacation. That's how beautiful this place was. As the buildings were going up at Evans Signal Laboratory, some of those sections would come down into Evans Signal Laboratory. When I came to work there, I was a draftsman. Then I was made an instructor. What we did was to supply draftsmen to replace the boys who were being drafted into the Army. Evans Signal Laboratory had an engineering department, and they needed personnel badly, particularly technical personnel. One of our jobs was to train these graduates who were taken from Asbury Park High School, Long Branch High School, and the high school in Manasquan. All the graduates were somewhat absorbed by the War Department, girls and boys. We had to train them as draftsmen, and I was an instructor. My specialty was submachine design, gears and cams, because while I was at Staten Island at the outbreak of War, the government had defense courses to train men for war preparation. So I took advantage of some of those courses, and I learned a lot of drafting. Besides that, I had had some math in high school and college. And that all helped me to get appointed as an instructor.    Ms. West: So your education was received in New York State?    Mr. Dente: Yes, I spent a year at NYU, and I never stopped studying. I took correspondence courses in the ICS, which were very, very helpful. They helped me a lot.    Ms. West: ICS is what?    Mr. Dente: International Correspondence School. I took some of their courses, which were very, very beneficial. And then Fort Monmouth also had courses there, technical courses, even manuals. And these were a tremendous help, too. Anybody who wanted to advance themselves could do so. A young man or woman could go to college, and the government paid their way and gave them a job after they graduated. And that's how good Fort Monmouth was. They were very liberal and cooperative in the War effort.    Ms. West: Speaking about yourself now, can you tell me about your ancestors?    Mr. Dente: My ancestors were Italian. My mother and father were born near Naples, twenty-eight miles from the Province of Avellino. My father came here in 1900, and my mother and two sisters came here in 1906. They came here because the economic conditions in Italy were not good, and the political system was still a residual from the Feudal System. In Southern Italy, the illiteracy rate, I regret to say, was almost 99%. The only ones who had an education were those who studied for the priesthood and the military. They had to be sons or daughters of the wealthy people. I regret to say that some who studied for the priesthood, before they became ordained, left and went into other fields because they had a good education. When my father came to this country, he couldn't get over the freedoms that they had here. He knew the opportunities they had, and he appreciated this country so much that he became a citizen right away. In spite of the fact of the illiteracy, my dad knew how to read and write. He learned that from a priest, fortunately. Then little by little, by association, he learned more. I'll be frank to say, he was in prison for some time for something he did, which was not his fault. But he learned how to read and write. Believe it or not, while my dad was in prison at Naples, he read the Count of Monte Cristo in Italian. He was very proud of that. The immigrants that subsequently followed came to my father for him to write letters for them to their friends back in Italy. But later on, literacy in Italy became more universal. Mussolini, for all the discredit that he had,  did try to increase  literacy in Italy. What he did was to send teachers from Northern  Italy to Southern Italy, and from Southern Italy to Northern Italy. And this did not meet with favors with some of the people, naturally. One of them was Carl Levi, a Jewish teacher from North Italy, who was anti-fascist. Mussolini wanted to punish him and sent him to a town in the Province of Salerno called Eboli. There he wrote a book called Christ Stopped at Eboli. I won't go into detail what it was about, but it was a bestseller at that time. But I will say this about Mussolini, as bad as he was, he did try to eradicate the Mafia in Sicily. In the early 1920s, he sent a man by the name of Mori to Sicily. He gave him a freehand to clean out the Mafia in Sicily. Well the man succeeded. In 1927, for the first time, Sicilians were able to go to court and say, "I accuse." And quite a few of the accused did go to jail. But somehow or other, when the Americans from Africa landed in Sicily in World War II, some of the information they received was from some of the gangsters who were deported from the U.S. into Sicily, and they knew the landing places of Sicily. And it was very helpful to the Americans landing in Sicily. But unfortunately, quite a few Mafia got out. And then the Mafia began to grow again from then on. Then Mussolini was arrested, and he met with his downfall when he tried to escape after Italy surrendered in September of 1944. She didn't have to go to war on the side of Germany, but Mussolini forced them to side with Hitler. And the Germans occupied Italy. But anyhow, somehow the Italians managed to get a surrender. They surrendered Italy to the allies, and some agreement was made for Italy to do its part on the side of the Allies. They gave up their fleet to the British, thank God for that. There was fear among the Allies that the Italian fleet, small as it was, was still powerful enough that under the command of the Germans, it could have been disastrous. But anyway, to make a long story short, King Victor Emmanuel III had Mussolini arrested. He was put in jail somewhere in the middle of Italy. As fate would have it, Hitler sent a group that landed on the roof of the jail, and they succeeded in taking Mussolini out of the jail. So Mussolini became an ill-fated partner of Hitler and met his end towards the end of the War. The War was waning, and the Allies had practically won the War. Mussolini got away and attempted to go into Switzerland with this woman, but he was spied or caught by the anti-fascists. I don't know whether they were Communists or not, but they did capture him and this woman, and they were executed right there on the spot. What happened next was his body was taken by the people of Milan, and they strung him up feet-first and they all took pot shots at his body because of what he had done to the Italians during World War II. But anyway, that's what happened.    Ms. West: You mentioned you had two sisters. Were they your only siblings?    Mr. Dente: No, I had three sisters. One sister's name was Carmella, and she came here around 1904. My dad came in 1900. He thought it would be a good idea to get one of the daughters to come here and learn the trace of America. That way when my mother and other two sisters came here, they would be familiar with how things were in America. But my dad was very happy to come here because he knew the difference between democracy here and the political system in Italy. And he urged everybody who came here to become a citizen. He was very adamant about that. And he wanted them all to vote, because voting was very important. He became an employee of the Health Department in New York City, and he was connected with mosquito extermination. Staten Island was very rural then. They had many ponds and lakes. And I'm sorry to say that New York City had disposed of its garbage in Staten Island, in a very beautiful waterway. But today, I am sad to say, it is a mountain of garbage. Why they picked Staten Island to dump their garbage, I don't know. But that's what happened.    Ms. West: As a youngster, did you have any heroes?    Mr. Dente: Heroes as a youngster? Oh yes, I had heroes. My dad always saw to it that I went to school, and he made sure I got a good education. I graduated from grammar school, which was very rare for boys in my time. At fourteen, I went to high school. There I learned Spanish, and I learned Italian dramatically. My dad, who knew Italian, wanted me to speak real Italian. And he helped me, and it was very important to me. At that time, Teddy Roosevelt was just about building the Panama Canal and had run for President against Taft and Wilson. This made it possible for Wilson to be elected. Well, my heroes really were sports figures. Jack Dempsey was a hero of mine. But my real hero was Babe Ruth, of whom there is no superior in my book. And then there is Lou Gehrig. He went to High School of Commerce in New York City, and I was going to Curtis High School in Staten Island. I often read about the exploits of this boy, Lou Gehrig, but it was at Columbia University. He was a pitcher and a hitter at that time, and he got a scholarship at Columbia, I believe. But he did not graduate from there, he signed up with the New York Yankees in 1922. Then I became a baseball fan of the New York Yankees. At that time, Babe Ruth had come to the Yankees from Boston for the sum of $125,000, which was an awful lot of money in those days. Jacob Ruppert was a very wealthy man, and he bought the Yankees. He was a part-owner and then became the sole owner, eventually, of the Yankees. He saw the value of Babe Ruth in Boston, who by the way, was a very, very good pitcher. He held record for consecutive scoreless hitting in World Series 26, until it was broken by Whitey Ford later on. But Babe Ruth came at a time when there was a baseball scandal. The Chicago White Sox were bribed by a gambler from New York. The Chicago White Sox and Cincinnati Reds were in the World Series at that time, which was in 1919, I believe. It was at the end of World War I, about which I'll talk later. One of the players on the White Sox squealed.    Ms. West: White Sox or Black Sox?    Mr. Dente: They were called the Black Sox, because of that stigma. But there were about six or seven White Sox players who were involved in that scandal or bribery. They were bribed to throw the game away to the Reds, which they did. And the Reds won the World Series at that time. The owners of baseball became alarmed because the people had lost so much faith in baseball, even though the Giants in New York were still very popular. So the owners chose a Federal Judge by the name of Judge Landis, who had fined the Standard Oil Company seven million dollars for breaking the Antitrust Laws in 1907. So the owners decided this was just the man for them. So this Judge decided to take the job under one condition. He would be the sole boss, and he wanted to run both Major Leagues. So the owners agreed.    Ms. West: And he was…    Mr. Dente: The Commissioner of Baseball until he died around the 1940s. The salvation of baseball was due, in large part, to Babe Ruth because of his home run hitting and this Judge's strict rule over the baseball team.    Ms. West: Tell us about Babe Ruth's nickname.    Mr. Dente: Babe Ruth got his name because he was born in Baltimore, Maryland, and when he was young, his father was a bartender at a saloon. He was of German extraction. Because he was a wayward boy and hard to manage, it was decided to send him to a Catholic home. It was called Saint Mary's, I think. Babe was a student there, and they had two Brothers there. One was Brother Gilbert and the other was Brother Mathias. They nurtured Babe and took care of him. And he was a very great athlete. The two Brothers saw the possibility of him becoming a baseball player. They called Jack Dunn, the Manager of the Baltimore Orioles. It was an International League team that had won so many championships in the International League. At that time, the International League was the supplier of ball players for the Major Leagues. The owner of the Orioles took Babe from the home, and because he was a young boy, the players called him Jack Dunn's baby. So that's how he got his name. His real name was George Herman Ruth, and then he got the name "Babe," and it stuck until he died in 1948. So those were my heroes. And of course I have been a Yankee fan since 1918, and I follow the Yankees. They went on to win many, many pennants, and they had great teams. Another hero at that time was Enrico Caruso, a tenor. He had a magnificent voice. He was an opera singer with the Metropolitan Opera, and he was born in Naples. He came here at the turn of the century, I believe. He became a very famous tenor, and he had one of the greatest voices. At that time, he was supposed to be the greatest tenor voice in the world. Caruso got associated with Victor Records, whose headquarters were in Camden, New Jersey. In order for him to make those records, he had to sing into the horn. Phonographs had a large horn that flared out to a big mouth. In order to make records, singers had to play or sing into this big horn. Acoustics at that time are not what they are today. And by the way, in 1900 sometime, Marconi developed the wireless telegraph. They received a message at Nova Scotia from England.  Marconi was from Italy, also. He got the idea from throwing a stone into the water. He thought if he could throw a stone into the water and have it conduct waves, he could do the same thing with air. So he hooked up a gadget and sent a message across from England somewhere, and it was picked up in Nova Scotia. And that was the beginning of electronics, because from that the radio was born. Now Marconi did not invent the radio, but he made it possible for radio to be developed. Marconi lived here in Monmouth Beach for awhile. He had a station down here in Evans, as I stated before. The radio got developed by the head of the RCA Corporation, and I can't think of his name right now, I think his name was David Sarnoff. Very few people were saved from the Titanic, but there were quite a number saved from the Lusitania, and they were saved by means of the wireless telegraph. When the survivors arrived in New York, they went and thanked this man, David Sarnoff, who received the message in New York City. And then from radio came television.    Ms. West: Now speaking of radio, do you have any favorite radio programs from when you were a youngster?    Mr. Dente: Ernest and Billy Hare, Jack Benny, and the Happiness Boys. And then there was Amos and Andy. Amos and Andy were a very popular team, but I understand the NAACP objected to the show because it stereotyped African Americans. But they were very good, and very popular. And then for some reason, it was taken off the air.    Ms. West: Amos and Andy was taken off the air? I don't think so.    Mr. Dente: Yes, it was taken off the air.    Ms. West: Well they were on television after they were on radio.    Mr. Dente: Yes, they were on television for awhile. But if I'm not mistaken, the NAACP objected, and as a courtesy to them it was taken off the air.    Ms. West: But that was one of the famous radio programs that you liked?    Mr. Dente: Let me say something else about Caruso. Caruso sang for the Liberty Bonds in Central Park, and he raised a lot of money for the war effort there.    Ms. West: For World War I.    Mr. Dente: Yes. At that time he fell in love with Dorothy Benjamin, the daughter of Park Benjamin, who was a magazine publisher. He was very wealthy, and he objected to the love affair. They lived in Spring Lake, New Jersey.  Park Benjamin objected to Caruso marrying his daughter because he was Italian. That was the assumption at that time. But in spite of her father's objection, Dorothy married Caruso, and she was very happy. They had a daughter named Gloria. So Caruso sang in a Jewish opera called La Juive. During the performance of that opera, Caruso broke a blood vessel in his throat and started coughing up blood. He recovered for awhile, but then in 1921, he went back to Naples. He died there in August of 1921, and the world was very saddened by his death. He was irreplaceable. Well, World War I broke out in 1917 after the sinking of the Lusitania, and President Wilson spent his summers at Shadow Lawn here, which later became Monmouth College and subsequently Monmouth University. And I'll speak about that later. But President Wilson made a speech urging America to go to war with Germany, because of the violation of the freedom of the seas.    Ms. West: So you are saying that President Wilson was once a resident of Monmouth County?    Mr. Dente: He spent his summers here at Shadow Lawn.    Ms. West: Where is Shadow Lawn located in Monmouth County?    Mr. Dente: West Long Branch. And there were other presidents who spent their summers in Long Branch. President Garfield died in Long Branch.    Ms. West: Oh really?    Mr. Dente: Yes. President Garfield was shot in Washington by an office seeker. He didn't get the job, so he shot President Garfield. And Garfield came here to recuperate.    Ms. West: Do you know what year that was?    Mr. Dente: I would say after the Civil War.    Ms. West: Who is the first President that you remember?    Mr. Dente: I remember William Howard Taft. He became President of the United States, and he was from Ohio. Teddy Roosevelt became Vice President, but he didn't sit well with the Republican Party in New York State. Teddy was too liberal  he was like Franklin D. Roosevelt. He was against the big business, the corporations, and all that. Teddy was the forerunner…    Ms. West: Do you remember the New Deal?    Mr. Dente: Oh, definitely. I'll speak about that later. I'll tell you about the Depression, if you have time. Do you have time? So President Theodore Roosevelt didn't sit well with the Republican Party in New York, so in order to get rid of him, they put him on a ticket with McKinley. McKinley was in office, and he got shot by an assassin. Then Teddy Roosevelt became President. And when Roosevelt became President, he initiated the Panama Canal. And then he really got on the backs of Standard Oil, U.S. Steel, and all those big companies. In 1914, Taft was running for reelection, and Teddy Roosevelt wanted to run for President. So he got on the ticket for the third party, and he made it possible for Wilson to be elected.    Ms. West: Are there any newspaper headlines that stand out in your mind through the years?    Mr. Dente: Yes. On Good Friday, April 1917, War was officially declared on Germany. And then there was Peace on November 11, 1918. Of course that was a big headline. After that, there were the Presidential elections like Harding, who became President in 1921. And there was a big scandal, the Teapot Dome Scandal of 1921. Coolidge became President because Harding died in office. Then Coolidge didn't choose to run for the third time, so Herbert Hoover ran against Smith in 1928. Smith was a Catholic, and the feeling was very high against a Roman Catholic at that time. He lost the solid South, which had been Democratic since the Civil War because of Lincoln. But he lost the South, and the only states that Smith carried were Massachusetts and Rhode Island. Then in 1932, President Roosevelt, who had been Governor of New York State,  was nominated on the Democratic ticket and defeated the current President. And then the New Deal was his motto. Under Roosevelt, the banks were closed when he became inaugurated. On the day of his inauguration he said the only thing we had to fear was fear itself. And he closed the banks for ten days, because banks were failing as a result of the Depression. There was a very bad Depression then, and God forbid we would have anything like it ever again. After that, confidence came back. Then Roosevelt initiated Social Security and Medicare, and other factors of the New Deal.    Ms. West: What would you say was your greatest achievement in life?    Mr. Dente: My greatest achievement in life is my family and helping the War effort, what little I did.    Ms. West: Were you a veteran?    Mr. Dente: I was 4F twice. I was rejected. But I did receive a medal at Fort Monmouth in 1967, I believe. The highest Second Army Civilian Award. I have a picture over there of me being decorated. That was very nice. I was very proud of that, and here is the certificate I got.    Ms. West: Oh, back in 1967.    Mr. Dente: There was a big parade at Fort Monmouth that day.    Ms. West: How did you become interested in electronics?    Mr. Dente: I studied that, and then I took those defense courses.    Ms. West: Oh, the courses that you were telling me about.    Mr. Dente: Yes. I took drafting courses and defense courses. As a matter of fact, we even built a twenty-six foot Coast Guard boat in a defense course. But then I had to file for Civil Service as a draftsman, and then I came to Fort Monmouth and took courses there. Anybody could advance themselves there.    Ms. West: Did you ever have any hobbies?    Mr. Dente: Yes, gardening was my hobby. I also like classical music, and I like gourmet cooking. And I used to love to go to the opera. We used to see the ships go by, big liners. In those days, they didn't have the airplanes that supplanted those big liners. For example, I saw a German ship confiscated by the Americans during World War I. It was called Vaterland, or the Fatherland Laterleviathin. That was one of the ships confiscated by the Allies. Then I saw the Normandy, a big, French boat. It was the biggest in the world at that time. It came to America.    Ms. West: This was between what years?    Mr. Dente: Between 1936 and 1941. The Normandy was supposedly the biggest ship of that time. On its last trip, it was during World War II, it stayed in berth and in the harbor. But somehow or other it caught on fire, and it turned over on its side. But the Navy righted the ship by sealing all the holes, and it took all the air out of it. Believe it or not, this righted the ship. But then it was taken away for junk. But it was built for national prestige. France vied with the Cunard Line, which had two ships called the Queen Mary and the Queen Elizabeth. They helped them bring the American troops over to Europe.    Eugene Dente and his wife, Elizabeth, in 1983  Eugene Dente and his wife, Elizabeth, in 1983    Ms. West: I am looking at a picture. Is this your wife?    Mr. Dente: Yes, that is a high school picture. I met her in high school.    Ms. West: What year were you married?    Mr. Dente: We were married in 1933, but that was her high school graduation picture. She was in my Spanish class. This is our wedding picture.    Ms. West: Oh how beautiful! And you are handsome, too.    Mr. Dente: Oh, I was twenty-five years old at the time.    Ms. West: Now is this some of the flowers that were in the bouquet?    Mr. Dente: No.    Mr. Dente's Daughter: Daddy has some interesting stories about people he put through Ellis Island. He meet Maria Von Trapp.    Mr. Dente: I met the Trapp sisters at Ellis Island. They are the ones responsible for The Sound of Music. But they were not like the girl on that movie, they were real, big, husky, German  women. They were big, tall women with long hair. (laughter) Every once in awhile, they would get up and sing songs in German, and they kept the people entertained there. I met opera singers, prize fighters, and "the lady in red." She was the girlfriend of the gangster, what was her name? He was the gangster that got shot by the FBI, and she was Romanian. She was promised that they wouldn't deport her, but they did anyway. She was held on Ellis Island because she was deported.    Ms. West: Do you mean Al Capone?    Mr. Dente: No, John Dillinger. Monmouth County was full of farms when we came there, with many, many cows and dairy farms. The place at the mall where Foodtown is in Ocean, there was a dairy farm there. The farmer had Jersey cows there. Before the end of the War, he knew it was going to build up. Monmouth County was very beautiful. There were farms, vineyards, apple orchards, peach orchards, and there were fishermen. You could buy a filet of flounder for fifteen cents a pound back then.    Ms. West: Try to get it at that today.    Mr. Dente: It's five or six dollars a pound now. And who knows how old they are. And then Ocean County, going on Route 9,  wasn't then what it is now, either. All you could see was cranberry bogs on the side of the road, and you could go for miles before you would come to a stop. Lakewood was a haven for Jewish people from New York back then. They had a hotel down there by the lake. Lakewood had many pines, too. And that is where they got the name "Pineys." The air was supposed to be exhilarating. Whenever anyone had an operation in New York, he would be sent down here to that hotel to recuperate, because the air was so fine. John D. Rockefeller had an estate in Lakewood, off Highway 88, I believe. Jay Gould, the financier who had a very notorious history on Wall Street at the turn of the century, had a place in Georgian Court, which is now run by a Catholic organization, Georgian Court College. But it was a beautiful place with statues and a lake. But then it was taken over by the nuns, and it is now a college for girls, and maybe even men now.    Ms. West: What do you think is the most unusual thing about you?    Mr. Dente: Gee, I don't know. I love history very much. As a matter of fact, I wish I had followed up on that because I wanted to teach it. And I love languages.  I love the French, Italian, and Spanish languages.    Ms. West: You were a great reader, then?    Mr. Dente: Oh yes, I was a great reader. I was an admirer of Dante, and he lived in the thirteenth century, I believe. He was born in Florence, and he was the father of  the Italian language, because the languages spoken in Europe at that time were all dialects. The Latin language was mixed up with the Italian language. But Dante seemed to be a very smart man. He wrote this book about the Inferno, about visiting hell. It was about hell  consisting of so many concentric circles. And there was a famous saying that he wrote, "All ye who want to lose all hope, enter here."    Ms. West: Was he your favorite author then?    Mr. Dente: He was my favorite author, among others. And I liked the English authors very much, like Charles Dickens. He criticized the English school system, and even Oscar Wilde was good. Alfred Lord Tennyson wrote a masterpiece. And by the way, King Arthur never existed, you know. King Arthur was maybe a Roman General.  Tennyson wrote about King Arthur, and it was very, very beautiful. It was a great story. And I like dates, too. 1588 with the Spanish Armada. And Columbus was a hero of mine. He was a dividing part between the old world and the new world. In Europe, this new world was unknown. Civilization was located in the Mediterranean in Italy because of its strategic position between Northern and Southern Europe. They attracted the students there, and they were very rich. Florence was very rich at that time, and the Medici were the richest family in all Europe at that time. And there were two Italian cities which were at war with each other, Venice and Genoa. They had fleets fighting each other, and they wanted command of the Mediterranean to get that eastern trade to the Orient. But of course, they had to fight the Turks. The Turks at that time were coming in from Turkistan, and they conquered Turkey, which was under Rome. They got Jerusalem and then the Crusades started. But then Columbus was from Genoa. He figured that there was some way to sail to the east. There must have been another side to Japan and India. It just couldn't be reached, he figured. But the theory existed at that time that if you went on the ocean and got to a certain point, you would fall off. And another famous man I liked was Galileo. He didn't originate the idea of the Earth revolving around the Sun. The Earth revolving around the Sun originally was thought of by the old Greek philosophers, but it  had lain dormant until a Polish scientist by the name of Copernicus wrote a book. But he did not make the facts known until after he died. And thereby Copernicus expanded on that theory, but Galileo unfortunately became a victim of the Roman Catholic Church. They called him a heretic, because they still believed that it was the Sun that moved around the Earth. But the findings of Copernicus, as I said before, were made known after he died. So they couldn't do anything to him. But Galileo was about to be burned at the stake by the Catholic Church, and he had to recant. So he was put under house arrest, and the poor man died. Galileo invented the telescope and the pendulum. And he also designed the Tower of Pisa. Now the Tower of Pisa was built on solid ground at that time. But unfortunately, the solid ground was weak, and that's why it leans. Until this very day, it still leans. But all these centuries, they have tried to right it, but to no avail. But now they have taken some steps to right it gradually. Galileo was a professor at the University of Padua. It was a very learned institute at that time, but unfortunately the man was placed under house arrest. And there was another Italian, Giordano Bruno, who also believed that it was the Earth that moved around the Sun. He was from a town Nola in the southern province of Naples, not far from my mother and father's hometown. And that man was actually burned at the stake.    Ms. West: Where was your mother and father's hometown in Italy?    Mr. Dente: Montefredane, the Province of Avellino. It is part of a region with Naples, called Campania. Italy was divided into regions, and Campania was one. Dente means tooth in Italian. That's where your word dentist comes from. The word barber, where do you think that comes from? And it means beard.    Ms. West: Alright.    Mr. Dente: Have you ever had spaghetti 'al dente'? That's the best way to eat macaroni. A little chewy.    Ms. West: Barely cooked. Let's see now. If you could live your life again or over, is there anything that you would change?    Mr. Dente: No, that's about it.     Ms. West: Is there any particular place or location here in Monmouth County that has any significance to you besides Fort Monmouth and Camp Evans?    Mr. Dente: Freehold is of significance because they had the Battle of Molly Pitcher near there.    Ms. West: Besides Freehold, are there any other places in Monmouth County?    Mr. Dente: They are all important. I guess Sandy Hook, because I worked there. And it's a park now. And then the Twin Lights are nice. That park overlooks the Bay, and they have a very great history of Marconi up there. If you ever have time, please visit it. They give you a story about Marconi, about how he got the wireless across and how he used it for certain events. That was a good place to visit.    Ms. West: And Marconi once lived here in Monmouth County.    Mr. Dente: Yes, in Monmouth Beach.    Ms. West: Is there anybody in Monmouth County who made an impression upon you?    Mr. Dente: J. Russell Wooley was a Republican leader here in Monmouth County. He was the Chairman of the Republican Party.    Ms. West: What year?    Mr. Dente: When Goldwater ran for President in 1965.  And that was a mistake he made. That's when the Republican power was somewhat broken in Monmouth County. That's when we elected James J. Howard for Congressman. He came in when Lyndon Johnson swept the election. He brought James J. Howard in with him. James Howard stayed there until the poor man died.    Ms. West: Who was James Howard?    Mr. Dente: A Congressman. He succeeded a Republican, Auchincloss. The Republicans ruled Monmouth County, but James Howard, a Democrat, was a very good Congressman. He was the man that put through the highway that is 195, because he was Chairman of the Appropriations Committee in the House. He became very powerful.     Ms. West: Do you feel that there is something that you would still like to accomplish?    Mr. Dente: At ninety-two, what else can I accomplish? How much time have I got left?    Ms. West: Just yesterday I saw, on Channel 2, the man who was 102 years old from Texas, who had just written a book. So ninety-two years old is a lot younger. As hardy as you appear to be today, you have a lot of years ahead.    Mr. Dente: If I had the gift of writing, I could write a book of what happened. I used to like to read the New York Times. It is the most wonderful paper, to me, in the whole U.S. because it covers almost everything, and it's very intelligently written. It has very good writers, and it leans in accordance with how I feel. I used to love to work their crossword puzzles because I learned a lot from them.    Ms. West: Could you finish them?    Mr. Dente: Oh yeah, but not totally. I finished them mostly, but then I waited for the answers the next day. But what was valuable about that was that I learned a lot because I had to look up words in the dictionary and the encyclopedia.    Ms. West: I used to love to do the Times crossword puzzle, too. But I could never finish them.    Mr. Dente: Especially the sections on Sunday.    Ms. West: Well, that was the one I would try to do.    Mr. Dente: They weren't so bad in the beginning. But lately they have become very, very difficult. Sometimes they use foreign words. Of course if they are French, Italian, Spanish or maybe a little German, I could understand some. But the reason I gave it up is because I had to wrap the papers up for recycling, and they got kind of cumbersome. So I had to cut it down. I get the Asbury Park Press, which doesn't cover everything. The new owners are not as good as the old ones, and I think the reputation has fallen down. It's a good paper, but not as good as the old one.    Ms. West: What would you consider is your milestone in life?    Mr. Dente: When I started working at Ellis Island. That was an important event, although I didn't stay there because the War broke out. Another milestone would be living here in Monmouth County, which is where I raised a fine family. And I like to see my grandchildren. Unfortunately, I lost a grandson in 1992. He got hit by a train at ten o'clock at night.  He was on a bike, and they lived in Allenhurst. He was about to cross the railroad track, and the gates were down and the bell was ringing. The train went by, and the bell kept ringing. And for some reason or another, he decided to cross, but a train was coming northward bound at fifty miles per hour, and it didn't stop at the station. And my grandson got hit. And he was a very, sweet boy. To this very day, I grieve over him. He would have been twenty-three years old now. He chose Allenhurst to live, because he wanted to be with the young boys with whom he grew up. But to this very day, I grieve over him. My wife and I were very fond of him.    Ms. West: What would you think is the most important legacy that you would leave to your family?    Mr. Dente: The love of this country. I tell them not to do anything to hurt this country. It has been very good. Maybe this country is not perfect, but you will never get all the freedoms and benefits that you get here in any other country in the world. This country is the only country in the world that can feed itself, has lots of freedoms, and can still feed part of the world. I can't understand the logic of some countries wanting to destroy this country. They would be cutting their own throat! Russia knows that now, fortunately. And there would be no winner in a nuclear war. Everyone would be wiped out. But are why these countries building nuclear heads to hit the U.S.? What would they gain? Do they think the U.S. would not retaliate? But everyone would all suffer. That's why I would like to see this country survive. I would like to see the blacks and whites live together. Slavery was a bad thing, and why should they ever have been held in bondage? That was bad, the way those poor people lived. Lincoln fought for their freedom, and he fought to keep this country together. And the poor man had to meet that fate. That was a shame.    Ms. West: What concerns you most about the state of the world today?    Mr. Dente: There is so much going on in different countries. There is no peace in Ireland, for example. And the Jewish people and the Arabs are not getting along. And then the way those people live in Iran, the women have no rights at all. Now they have a government and are trying to break away, but they are meeting with resistance from the old establishment. And Hussein is another threat. Why he wants to destroy his country, I don't know. All those things are a source of concern. Even in Cuba  I don't know if the sanctions against Cuba are good or not. But there are people suffering there because of the sanctions. They aren't getting any medical supplies or anything like that. Hopefully they will come to terms. After all, Castro can't live forever. Sooner or later, he is going to go. They are nearby, and we should get along with them. So thank God South America is democratic. Let's hope they stay that way.    Ms. West: Is there any part of your life that you would like to relive?    Mr. Dente: I would like to go back for the first sixty-seven years, if possible. I have made mistakes, but you have to live with what you got.    Ms. West: Well, we all make mistakes, you know.    Mr. Dente: I have hurt some people, and I didn't live up to expectations. I disappointed so many people, including my parents. They wanted me to get a college degree and go on, but unfortunately I didn't. I couldn't make it. I spent one year at NYU, and I failed Trigonometry. They had a student teacher that taught that class, and I failed the midterm, but I passed the final exam. So what did she do? She added both of them together. So by a few points, I got a failing mark. And I spoke with other teachers, and they said they went by the final exam, which covers everything. But I couldn't get her to budge, so I didn't make the grade. But I never stopped going to school. I took courses, I went to night school, and I took many courses. I took drafting, languages, and I never stopped studying. I had good parents. They kept feeding me and gave me a good home, and for that I am very grateful.    Ms. West: What major changes have you seen in this country?    Mr. Dente: During the Roosevelt administration, there was a marked change in the people down the line getting some of the things that the rich people were getting. Social Security and Medicare, they never had that. And guarantee of bank deposits. In 1929, bank deposits were not guaranteed. That's one thing that Mr. Roosevelt put through. All deposits up to $100,000 are now guaranteed, but they weren't at that time. Then anybody could play the stock market in 1929, with ten per cent down. But you never got that stock. The broker held that stock. If the stock went down, they had margin clerks. They'd send you a telegram to come across with so much money, and they would give you one day's time. If you didn't, then the broker took that stock, and down the drain went your investment. Everybody thought they were going to become rich. But the 1929 Depression was terrible. The population in the U.S. at that time was 130 million, in the 1930s. I think seventeen million people were out of work, mostly men or the wage earners. Women didn't count, in those days. The only thing women did was to do office work, or become nurses and school teachers. That's all. They did not become engineers or carpenters, etc. But those seventeen million people were wage earners. And they had soup kitchens to feed the hungry, and people were committing suicide because they couldn't make ends meet. Two or three families lived in one flat, just to pay rent. And the soup kitchens fed the hungry. But then Roosevelt started this WPA, and that helped a little.    Ms. West: What does WPA stand for?    Mr. Dente: Works Progress Administration. They hired people to do odd jobs for the towns and the government, and they paid them so much money. But then World War II came about, and they couldn't get enough people for defense jobs. But the mistake Roosevelt made was to run for the fourth term. He was a very sick man in the fourth term. He had the conference at Yalta,  in Russia, and Winston Churchill thought you couldn't have a peace conference in five days. Russia got into the War in Asia after Germany surrendered. She got in and invaded China. And once she got there, she stayed there. And all the equipment that Russia left there, the Communists took over. And then they got Korea. And so Roosevelt should never have done that. He gave Russia too much at that time. And poor Chiang Kai-shek  went to Taiwan.    Ms. West: Who was Chiang Kai-shek?    Mr. Dente: He was a Chinese General in command of anti-Japanese forces in China. The Japanese came in and bombed the poor Chinese. So he tried to hold off the Japanese, but they came in and gobbled up most of China. He fought as best he could. And what were we doing? We were giving Japan oil to fight them! The Russians got into China, and they fought the Japanese. And then they knew the War was going to end. And MacArthur, he was bitter about that. He wanted to bomb their posts in China, but they wouldn't let him. We didn't want to get us into war in China, so that was a very turning point. We could have saved Asia, and now China is Communist. Who knows what will happen?    Ms. West: Are there any Italian customs or things that you celebrate?    Mr. Dente: Columbus Day, yes. We celebrate that because he changed the world around. The Vikings claim that they discovered America. And I'll give them credit for being the first people here, yes. But they didn't accomplish what Columbus accomplished.      Mr. Dente cooking Italian food, 1996    Ms. West: Are there any Italian things you practice?    Mr. Dente: Tomato pies, and all the food that the Italians introduced into this country. Broccoli and artichokes were Italian. Some of them came from the Arabs in Italy, and the Arabs made a big contribution when they occupied parts of Italy and Sicily.    Ms. West: Any particular religious celebrations?    Mr. Dente: I am a Catholic by birth and upbringing, and I celebrate Christmas and Easter. I am kind of liberal, yes.    Ms. West: I thought maybe there was some custom that your parents celebrated over there in the old country that they brought to the U.S.    Mr. Dente: The old Italians who came with the first wave of immigration used to celebrate feast days. Have you ever heard of Mulberry Street? I had roots there, and we had relatives and people we knew there. They had those stands selling all those Italian goodies, until the Mafia got in and cut it out. All these towns would always have these feast days like St. Anthony's Day on June 13th, the 15th of August is Our Lady of Assumption Day, and there is the Feast of San Gennaro in September. Each town had its favorite saint. They would have these bands, and they would march around during the day. At night time, the bands would play and they would shoot off fireworks. The Gucci family was from Naples. My parents told me in Southern Italy they would have fireworks in each town, and they would give a prize to which company had the best fireworks. There were several firework companies that supplied the fireworks. And we have fireworks over here.    Ms. West: And we'll have a big celebration on the Fourth of July at South Street Seaport.    Mr. Dente: You have got to have experts take care of that, or otherwise they could be dangerous.      Dente Family Reunion 1989  Ms. West: So I understand. What are your strong points or values?    Mr. Dente: My family, I would say. There is gardening, and things like that.    Ms. West: If you could give advice to youngsters today, what would you pass on to them?    Mr. Dente: To love this country, and to obey the laws and customs here. And to get along with mankind, everybody. Everybody is your brother and sister. You can't have divisions, because they are harmful. I would like to see the black people get treated more fairly. Down in South Carolina, they have the Confederate flag flying under the American flag. Fortunately, they took that away. But it still is not eradicated fully. I'd like to see more brotherly love among all people.    Ms. West: We need that among everybody, everyone. How long have you lived here in West Long Branch?    Mr. Dente: We built this house in 1950, and we have been here ever since. We bought the lot here in 1949. We had gone by and we loved it. This used to be a chicken farm, and we were the first house built here. Then after that, close to eighty-percent of the houses were built subsequent to 1950. Monmouth College started at the Long Branch High School at night. They gave out Associate Degrees, and then a group got together and bought Shadow Lawn, as it was known then. And then it was known as Monmouth Junior College. Then later on, it became Monmouth College and then Monmouth University. They bought a lot of adjoining land, much to the displeasure of the people in West Long Branch, because a lot of the land they bought became tax-free. By the way, when we moved here, there were no sewers in West Long Branch. They were all septic tanks. Later on, they installed sewers on every street in West Long Branch and in all the towns around here, with several exceptions. And that's one good thing. And the environment is a little cleaner and better now. Now there is fear since the Governor closed Marlboro Hospital. She shouldn't have done that, because a lot of those patients are on the streets now. And now there is the danger that the developers want most of that land. If they do that, the water supply that we get will be tainted because it supplies the river. She should never have closed the Marlboro Hospital. A lot of those people are on the streets now, and that's a mistake they made.    Ms. West: That's most unfortunate.    Mr. Dente: She may be a good Governor and all that, but she never should have done that.    Ms. West: Well, it looks like I have taken up a lot of your time. And you had so many interesting things to say.    Mr. Dente: Maybe you can come back some other time.    Ms. West: Well, I thank you. I was just going to say if there is something that you think about that you would like to add to our conversation, I can always come back. Thank you very much for your participation in our project.      
MonmouthCounty;Ermon K. Jones;1924;1999;Ermon K. Jones, 1924, 1999        Remembering the 20th Century: An Oral History of Monmouth County      Ermon K. Jones  Date of Interview: September 5, 1999   Name of Interviewer: June West   Birthdate of Subject: January 16, 1924    Mr. Jones: My name is Ermon K. Jones and it is a pleasure to be in involved in this interview as it pertains to Monmouth County as we look back at the 20th century.  We're here this afternoon in September preparing a document which will be a historical account of some activities which occurred in the past century.     I am a life long resident of the Township of Neptune and the County of Monmouth in the State of New Jersey. I was born in 1924 in the Township of Neptune on a homestead, which still stands at 530 Myrtle Avenue. I received my early education in the Township. I attended the school located on Ridge Avenue, which is an elementary school from grades K to eighth. I was in that school for five years and then I was transferred to the Whitesfield Elementary School, which is located in the western section of the Township. I attended Neptune High School, the single high school in the township for all the children from the five or six K-8 schools.  I graduated in 1942, and that following spring I enrolled in Monmouth Jr. College, which today is Monmouth University. It was a junior college at that time, and it had classroom in the Long Branch High School.  Long Branch is a city located about five miles from the Township of Neptune. I entered into the military services, the United States Army, in April of 1943, and completed the tour of duty in December 1944. In September 1945, having served in the military, I was eligible for benefits under the GI Bill of Rights. I entered Morgan State University, received a Bachelor of Science Degree, and only having six months left on my GI Bill, I received a masters degree from Teachers College, Columbia University in New York in 1951.    My early childhood in the Township of Neptune was similar to most youngsters and children who were born around that time.  I actually lived in a neighborhood which was comprised of white and Black homeowners. As a youngster, I enjoyed most of those activities that most youngsters were enjoying at that time: stickball in the street, kick the can, and ring-a-lievio, and things of that nature. And incidentally, the participants were both Black and white youngsters, so they were activities which were integrated at that time.    After I returned from college, I commenced a  thirty-four year employment at a military installation located in Fort Monmouth, New Jersey. Half of those years were in engineering. The final years were as Chief of the Equal Employment Opportunity Office.  The duties and responsibilities were to provide for the equal employment opportunities in the federal government as far as promotions and job opportunities are concerned.    During the time of the Civil Rights Movement I was a participant as far as the community is concerned. I was a member of the local branch of the NAACP, the Asbury Park Neptune Branch, specifically.  I served as the Education Chairman and then also as the Branch President for three years.  I am a life long member of the branch and have been involved since the early 1960s.    My parents were originally from Virginia. They came to New Jersey to Neptune Township to reside and to raise a family. I am one of three brothers and two sisters.  I guess the person who actually had an impact upon myself and the rest of our family was my mother, who was insistent that all of us attend college. As a result of that insistence we all did.  I have two brothers who are attorneys. And it was because of her assistance that we attended college. And I guess it goes back to the days when I was a youngster  she was very active in the local Parent Teacher Association and was concerned about not only her children, but other children, with respect to educational opportunities. During my tenure year as President of the Education chairmen and President of the NAACP, I think we had a tremendous impact upon the educational opportunities in the Township of Neptune because we hassled with the local Board of Education alleging and claiming that equal education opportunities did not exist for African American students. As a result of that, a suit was filed and there was a change in the educational system in the Township of Neptune.    Mrs. West: You mentioned the Township of Neptune, did this action have any effect on any other towns in the county?    Mr. Jones: During this period of time, there was a claim by most leaders in the various communities about the type of educational opportunities that were being given to African American students.  Asbury Park was involved and Asbury Park High School was just one single high school.  The action also had an impact upon the public school systems in Long Branch, Red Bank, Freehold, and most of the townships along the shore where most of the students in one particular classroom or school facility or district were predominately segregated. I guess that initiative had an impact upon my concern and interest not only for the educational opportunities, but also for the employment opportunities at Fort Monmouth, and then the area of housing opportunities. During that particular time, the late 1950s and early 1960s, the federal government was making available to veterans in particular an opportunity to purchase houses under the GI Bill of Rights. But most of New Jersey and most of the cities and townships and municipalities in New Jersey in fact were denying equal housing opportunities to African Americans. I, not only because I had the right under the GI Bill of Rights, but also as an American citizen, felt that I should be able to purchase a home in the area which I could afford, without discrimination.  I ventured out to exercise that right, but was denied, and in 1959 I filed a complaint with the local realtor or developer who was building homes in the Township of Neptune exclusively for white home owners. We eventually had to venture into court procedures, even to the extent that we had it involved as a final jurisdiction the State Supreme Court. So it was three to five years that we pursued this case, and in the Supreme Court we were victorious, and our home was built in all white housing development. As a result of that, it had an impact on the area as far as the housing opportunities of residents and the Township of Neptune, and also on the surrounding communities and also throughout the state of New Jersey.    Mrs. West: Do you still find this existing now?  This was forty years ago.    Mr. Jones: Well there's no question about it, there has been progress. As I said before, when we pursued our housing complaint, I think at the time there were six developments going up in Neptune Township and all of the prospective homeowner buyers were white. As a result of that, with the developments being built not only in Levittown, New Jersey (the biggest developer in the state of New Jersey), but also in Freehold and Red Bank and Long Branch and Asbury Park, there were opportunities available.  There was an increase in opportunities available for African Americans. There has been a tremendous change in the County of Monmouth as far as housing opportunities are concerned, and not only with respect to the individual pursuits by African Americans.  The Civil Rights Division's goal is to eliminate discrimination, not only in education and employment, but also in housing. So the Neptune decision has had an impact not only immediately, but also throughout New Jersey and the country. There are still certain incidents where housing discrimination may appear, but I think we all agree and share the point of view that the opportunities for equality of home ownership have improved over the years in Monmouth County.    Mrs. West: Are there any other historical events that have happened over your lifetime in the county?     Mr. Jones: Oh, yes.  I can think of another specific area that I have been involved in in Monmouth County that has had an impact upon the county and the municipalities surrounding Monmouth County.  It goes back to 1964 when the federal government had a pursuit against poverty.  As a component of this pursuit against poverty program, the Head Start program began.  This was a program for disadvantaged preschool children that provided them an opportunity to get a head start before they started public schools.  In the Township of Neptune, the act was passed in 1963.  The implementation of the Head Start program depended on the facilities available.  It was felt at the time, particularly in Neptune Township, that during the summer when most of our schools are closed, that the school should be made available for Head Start participants.  Sadly, we and the parents had to prevail upon the local Board of Education to provide these facilities for Head Start children.  It was necessary to demonstrate our concern by having demonstrations in front of the Board of Education to prevail upon them to make the schools available for Head Start.  As a result of that, in the Township of Neptune, there was a Head Start program in 1964 and it exists today in 1999.  I have been involved in it since then.  I've been a member of the Board of Trustees for that program over all of these years, and it has had an impact upon the children, particularly those disadvantaged children, not only in Monmouth County, but also in the surrounding areas.  We have thirteen centers throughout Monmouth County, and in Freehold, Keansburg, Red Bank, and Long Branch  we are serving over 500 disadvantaged children by providing Head Start services for them.  It involved, in the initial program, implementation by the Board of Chosen Freeholders in Monmouth County, who were strong participants and who provided financial support and facilities for the Head Start program.          Mrs. West: Besides the advancements in education, what are your most prominent memories of Monmouth County?    Mr. Jones: Well, as far as the county is concerned, there may have been some times that I, as a resident of Monmouth County, have been dissatisfied and viewed some of the things which occurred in Monmouth County unfavorably. But I realized that politics is part of it, so I've been involved in that also.  I served on the State Committee as a member of the Democratic party and I served locally, and I have found that as far as Monmouth County is concerned, politically it has provided opportunities. There have been changes and I think that all of this has been done in order to improve the quality of life in Monmouth County, which I have experienced since my early childhood to the end of this century.    Mrs. West: What would you say has been your greatest achievement?    Mr. Jones: I guess my greatest achievements would be in three areas: education, housing, and employment.  I think I have demonstrated concern and interest and a sensitivity for these three areas of life here in Monmouth County. I had the opportunity to work towards the equality of employment opportunities based upon the person's abilities rather than his or her skin color. The second area has undoubtedly been education, which is very important, because it has had an effect upon my life and my progress, and on what I've been able to achieve.  I think it's a key element as far as youngsters are concerned, and this has been borne out of my many years with the Head Start program. I think the final area of accomplishment, and I think this is essential to any quality of life, particularly as far as the African Americans are concerned, relates to ownership of a home and housing opportunities.  I have been involved in these three specific areas which I think have had an impact upon not only myself as a resident of Monmouth County, but I think on all African Americans as far as those three areas are concerned.    Mrs. West: If you had a map of your life in Monmouth County, would it be a rocky road map with ups and downs?    Mr. Jones: And that's expected, yes. Those things that I have experienced in my life in Monmouth County, you can anticipate to occur particularly if you're an African American and you are seeking out all those opportunities and rights and privileges that everyone else enjoys. So, I've seen some very unpleasant times that we have experienced in housing as far as neighbors and how they view someone different from themselves.  I think those experiences that go along with the challenge for equality of educational opportunities in the classroom are expected, because it is noticeable when the child sitting next to another child is different from him or her.  Discrimination is expected, because we all are human beings. We all have those same instincts and desires to move ahead and so forth, but all of those, if you want to call them, rocky roads exist.  They not only have existed for me as an individual and an activist, but I think they exist for a lot of people who have that desire to move forward and to progress and to demonstrate their abilities and capabilities.    Mrs. West: What would you say is the most unusual thing about you?    Mr. Jones: Well, I don't know.  Some of the things that I've said and how I've said them.  There are times when I feel that it would be better not to say anything. I think I've been successful as far as all of that is concerned, because, you know, it's just like anyone else who's out there challenging things, objecting, demonstrating, making allegations, and all of those things. I think it takes a particular person.  I've always felt that I have to be that person who has that type of charisma, which is necessary for solving human problems, and I think I've reached that goal.    Mrs. West: As a member of the Township and also of the County, I'm sure you must be aware of the respect and high esteem that the people have for you.  And the high regard for you  this must make you feel very good.     Mr. Jones: Yes, I've heard that, but I think sometimes I've been involved in areas probably that I should not have been involved in. I can recall in the Township of Neptune that a lot of people viewed my involvement in trying to break down the barriers in the volunteer fire company as ridiculous and not necessary, because nobody had to volunteer for it. But all that is a part of the quality life, and there are youngsters I feel certain who would have liked to become firemen but couldn't, because volunteer firemen, as I was growing up,  were all white.  There was no Black fireman that I can recall when I went to public schools, but still I felt that that was a part of society that should be available to all.    Mrs. West: As an activist in the community through the years, are there any particular headlines that stand out in your mind that might have provoked you to work on certain things or subjects?    Mr. Jones: Yes, I guess I'll have to refer back to those three areas because as far as the issue of the fact of segregation was concerned, that was a very sensitive issue. I think it had an impact on a lot of the residents of Neptune Township because it involved children, and it involved busing, and it involved a neighborhood school.  We had incidents with the Board of Education to get them to realize that equality of educational opportunities did not exist. That was a tremendous area I think. I think it was because of those in the white community who shared the concern that yes, equal opportunity was provided. As far as discrimination in employment is concerned, I go back to Monmouth County particularly when they opened up the Freehold Raceway. This was a raceway in Monmouth County  the first, although it was harness racing, it was a raceway.  A couple years after they were in operation, there were still no African Americans at any of the windows -- the teller windows, or the paramutual window, or anything. There was a person I sought out in the African American community to be the first person to be at one of those windows at the racetracks in Freehold Raceway.    Mrs. West: In what way is your life different or your mindset different?  Have you accomplished all you set out to do, or do you want to accomplish more?    Mr. Jones: I think I have accomplished most of the goals that I set, and as I said before, those goals were in those three areas and I think that in all of them I have been successful.  I think that the accomplishment in all of them has only come about because of concern, dedication, and most of all perseverance. I think that's been a quality I possess.  If I set a goal, it may be difficult, but I feel I have to persevere. That probably comes from my involvement with the Omega Psi Phi Fraternity in college, because of those four cardinal principles of that fraternity.  I've been involved in that fraternity since 1948, which is about fifty years.  Those four cardinal principles have not only been gratifying as far as my accomplishments in the fraternity are concerned, but as they relate to society and real life and what I'm trying to accomplish.  The cardinal principles of our fraternity are manhood, scholarship, perseverance, and uplift. I've tried to demonstrate them all in my life here in Monmouth County.    Mrs. West: You have received many awards.  Is there any award that stands out in your mind more than another?    Mr. Jones: No.  I view them all as equal. I spent fourteen years for example as a member of the Planning Board Township of Neptune where I had an opportunity to become involved in the planning of the Township.  Those years were gratifying to me, and I was recognized for my accomplishments. During the Civil Rights Movement in the County of Monmouth, the Board of Chosen Freeholders were following what I was doing and what I had hoped to achieve and so forth.  They recognized me, and Congress recognized me, and the representatives of the Township bestowed a single achievement upon me.  The Township of Neptune recognizes and honors those students who graduated from Neptune Township High School and have achieved something after their graduation. I was selected as one of the first honorees in the Neptune Township Hall of Fame. I think that was an outstanding recognition. I think I have been recognized particularly in those three areas we discussed: my achievements at Fort Monmouth and employment, my housing encounter, and my educational pursuits.  My local church in Asbury Park has been my church for these seventy odd years.  I commenced as a teacher of a Sunday school. I was an usher. I replaced a person as Superintendent of Schools who had served for thirty years.  I've been on the Board of Trustees of the church and served as its Chairperson for the last fifteen or twenty years.  My faith and my religious participation have been a part of my life.    Mrs. West: With all this hard work for the County of Monmouth, did you pursue any hobbies to rest your mind?    Mr. Jones: I'm not a golfer.  I enjoy and I guess my hobby would be more or less landscaping, building things in a home, watching sports  all of those have been a part of my hobbies.    Mrs. West: You beautified the county.    Mr. Jones: I hope so, I hope so.    Mrs. West: Anything else you want to say?      Ermon Jones with his wife, Blanche  Mr. Jones: I look back on my early childhood and how I was raised: my family and their concern and their interest in the things that we as youngsters did at that time as  compared to what youngsters do now. Over the many years, I feel somewhat proud of myself and the things that I have done.  I sincerely believe that they have had an impact upon other individuals and other residents in the County of Monmouth.    Mrs. West: Looking at     
MonmouthCounty;Erma Bennett Dorrer;xxxx;2000;Erma Bennett Dorrer, xxxx, 2000        Remembering The 20th Century: An Oral History of Monmouth County    Erma Dorrer, present day  Erma Dorrer, present day    Date of Interview: September 25, 2000  Name of Interviewer: Lydia Wikoff  Premises of Interview: Ms. Dorrer's apartment, Tinton Falls, NJ  Birthdate of Subject: N/A    Ms. Wikoff: My recollections are so fond of Erma Dorrer because she wasn't Mrs. Dorrer when she had me in the sixth grade, but I mentioned that she probably knows me by the name of Stillwell. Erma's long-term teaching career is very well noted and has been written up in many papers and so this is going to be a fun time for us this morning. Erma, where you were born?      Erma Dorrer at the age of one  Ms. Dorrer: I was born on a farm in West Freehold in a great big fourteen-room house. And now it is no more, because they have a lot of new houses there. It really makes me very sad, but I walk there and I look across the fields where my father labored as a farmer and raised six children. I was the oldest of six. And remember my father really came from the Tennent area, and was very well known. He said that he didn't have a chance to go to college, and we were going somewhere and every one of us did go. Not to Vassar, and not to the more expensive colleges, but we went somewhere. And three of us became teachers in the community.      Erma Dorrer at Camp Trenton Normal, 1924  Ms. Wikoff: Did you go to Trenton State?    Ms. Dorrer: I went to Trenton State.    Ms. Wikoff: Yes. That's when it was called Trenton State.    Ms. Dorrer: Well, it really had just been called Normal School.    Ms. Wikoff: Yes, see, my mother went to the Normal School.    Ms. Dorrer: And, by the way, your mother was a wonderful person. Mrs. Stillwell was a teacher, and we became very good friends when I had the children, you and your sister, Eleanor, whom I loved so much. And I remember when I was ill one time, your mother substituted for me for quite a period of time. And I used to go out to your parent's farm, the Stillwell farm, often for dinner. And she was the greatest cook. I always loved to go to her house.    Ms. Wikoff: Well, teachers were so respected in those days, oh, my goodness. The sun just rose and shone for teachers. I mean, if you did anything bad in school, don't go home and tell your parents because it was the teacher that was right.      In 1952, fifty eighth-graders from Manalapan and Englishtown prepare for graduation at the Main Street Public School. Erma Dorrer, principal and teacher, is standing in the top row, center.  Ms. Dorrer: And you know, I still hear from many of those children I had in Englishtown school.    Ms. Wikoff: Um-hmm, well you were a dear teacher, you were loved.    Ms. Dorrer: And I loved them. I remember when I had a chance to go to another school in Manasquan  it took me three years to get around to actually going, to Manasquan. And I remember telling someone that I had taught in every room in that Englishtown school, and Joe Clayton, the County Superintendent, said, "Well, now it's just about time you went to another school."    Ms. Wikoff: Well, you know, you also taught Ted Narozanick.    Ms. Dorrer: Oh, I did. I just loved my Ted. In fact I'm going to call him today, I have to tell him something. I want to tell him, because I know he's running again, I so hope he gets elected.    Ms. Wikoff: I'm so proud of Ted.    Ms. Dorrer: Oh, I am too.    Ms. Wikoff: I mean, when you know somebody all his life, and he's dedicated his life to serving the public, he's a statesman in Monmouth County.    Ms. Dorrer: Well, you know, I remember him when he was a cute little boy. When he would get up to say a piece, you know, we had to speak, when we had programs, and I can remember him standing up on that Englishtown auditorium platform and saying his piece  I'm so proud of him. I hear from him all the time.    Ms. Wikoff: Oh, wonderful.    Ms. Dorrer: And I'm very active in the historical society of Manasquan, and I had him come and speak. And he also is a life member of Manasquan Historical Society. Well, let's go back to education. You know, I lost my only child -    Ms. Wikoff: I never knew that, Erma -    Ms. Dorrer: Yes, well, early, it was never born. I mean, lots of people didn't know.    Ms. Wikoff: I never knew that, I'm very sorry.    Ms. Dorrer: So I had planned to teach five years, and then when that happened, I went right back to teaching, and I taught for forty-one years. Then at the time my husband died in 1959, I just threw myself into education. And I -    Ms. Wikoff: It took the place of your loss -    Ms. Dorrer: Yes, and I went right up in the NJEA. I was executive committee member for many years. I was on the delegate assembly, and I have to laugh when I think that in Trenton they called me Mother Dorrer.    Ms. Wikoff: Instead of Mother Theresa!    Ms. Dorrer: And I knew all the people on the state level and all the politicians in Monmouth County who were active and gave a lot, like Dick Stout and all those people with whom I worked. And so Lydia, it's wonderful to have you here, because you were one of those many children that I loved.    Ms. Wikoff: Well, you were loved too, and as I say, teachers were so respected in those days. It really is a thing that's gone now  it's a shame.    Ms. Dorrer: Yes, it is not the same. And when I think of that little schoolhouse, when I first went to Englishtown  there was only one school  now there are about seven, are there not?    Ms. Wikoff: Oh, yes, yes. And now, of course, it's called Manalapan. I never even knew the word Manalapan.    Ms. Dorrer: No?    Ms. Wikoff: I never knew it until I started paying taxes.    Ms. Dorrer: Yes, I know.    Ms. Wikoff: I was an Englishtown girl, of course, because I went to school there. But now it has changed.    Ms. Dorrer: It has grown so.    Ms. Wikoff: Go back to your background of farming  I forget what your dad raised.    Ms. Dorrer: He raised potatoes, mostly. And hay. Then sometimes, we had all kinds of vegetables, and I remember one time when they raised tomatoes, which they trucked to Camden -    Ms. Wikoff: I'll bet, we did too -    Ms. Dorrer: Yes.    Ms. Wikoff: And if you went down there, and they had too many tomatoes, do you remember this, they would turn back your load.    Ms. Dorrer: Oh, yes! And the juice would be running through the truck. Oh, and this is one reason I didn't ever like to get tomato soup because I thought of that.    Ms. Wikoff: You knew what happened -    Ms. Dorrer: I knew what happened to it. My sisters and my brother and I worked right out of the field. I remember thinking, "Won't it be wonderful when I get too big and don't have to pick potatoes?"    Ms. Wikoff: Yes, I know, but I kind of loved sorting tomatoes -    Ms. Dorrer: When I was very young, I went across the field where my grandmother and grandfather had another farm, and they sort of adopted me, and I used to run back and forth between the two houses.    Ms. Wikoff: That road is Route 537 now .    Ms. Dorrer: Yes, 537.    Ms. Wikoff: So you were crossing such a busy road, but it probably wasn't even paved then.    Ms. Dorrer: Yes. And then even at Christmastime I remember the children, the rest of the children of the family always had to wait until I ran home, back to the family home, for Christmas, to open the presents and things.    Ms. Wikoff: Oh, how about that. That's wonderful.    Ms. Dorrer: Yes. Well, it's wonderful, back, far back, was a wonderful, wonderful time - it's something you look back on.    Ms. Wikoff: I know.    Ms. Dorrer: Of course, we were not wealthy, and I often wonder how my father did all he did. He sent us all to school and worked as hard as he did. That's why it sort of tears my heart out when I see all the expensive houses and the old farmhouses torn down, and it just tears my heart out.    Ms. Wikoff: Well, you might not have had to pay hardly anything for college. I know Hamilton, my brother, was able to work his way through, and it didn't cost anything.    Ms. Dorrer: I think Hamilton was in the eighth grade when I started teaching in the fourth grade. And Hamilton was someone who became really well known, and is well known.    Ms. Wikoff: Yes, he was a great educator.    Ms. Dorrer: Yes. And I am proud of him -- well there are many people who came out of that environment in that area who have made a name for themselves.    Ms. Wikoff: Yes, well see, the one thing that he didn't want to be was a farmer. And I can understand why. In fact, my parents didn't want me to marry Charles Wikoff because they knew he was going to be a farmer. And really the farmer's lives were pretty desperate in those days. Dad went through about three or four different farms. He couldn't make a living. You laugh about it now, but it was kind of sad.    Ms. Dorrer: And the area is so different now out there. Well, later I went on to get my degrees and -    Ms. Wikoff: Yes, and you had to, because you didn't have the complete degree to teach so where did you get your extra -    Ms. Dorrer: Rutgers. And then I went on, possibly pursuing education. And I would go on Saturdays, and after school, and then I married Raymond Dorrer, who was someone from New York whose family became friendly with my father. I met Raymond through the family. We were married, and he was a mechanic, and right in the Depression, we bought a place in Neptune. That was in the 1930s.    Ms. Wikoff: It was a garage.    Ms. Dorrer: A garage. And I used to drive back and forth from Neptune to Englishtown for years.    Ms. Wikoff: I didn't know that.    Ms. Dorrer: And then when he went into the service, I would go to work in Englishtown, come home, help in the garage with my brother-in-law, and we really did a very good business, but it was very trying because I remember I didn't have a very good car  it was an old Chevrolet, that was just about ready to fall apart -    Ms. Wikoff: But you had a mechanic for a husband anyway!    Ms. Dorrer: Yes, but Raymond was in the service, and so we carried on while he was in the service.    Ms. Wikoff: And then when he came out, did he continue the garage?    Ms. Dorrer: Yes. Well when he came back, he flew, he had a plane, and I had my ground training from Ed Brown, who was pretty well known in the local community of Wall Township. And Raymond went to Florida on a short vacation, and on his way back he went down off Atlantic City, and we never found anything, nothing was ever found.    Ms. Wikoff: That's sad.    Ms. Dorrer: Yes, that was very sad. And by that time I was teaching in Manasquan and -    Ms. Wikoff: That's why I didn't hear about it that much.    Ms. Dorrer: Yes. And I just loved my job in Manasquan. I was head teacher, about the same as vice-principal, and I was in charge of all the little odds and ends of discipline and so forth.    Ms. Wikoff: Well, you were an excellent organizer. But you had to be.    Ms. Dorrer: Well, I liked being a leader, and I would go to Trenton to meetings and most every Friday night they had the meetings, and I'd get home very late, and I just sort of threw myself into education, which I enjoyed so much.    Ms. Wikoff: Would you like to talk about some of the things that you reminisce about - I think we talked about the changes, a lot of the changes in Monmouth County - and we talked about, you know, how it was when you were growing up. What memories do you have when you went to school, before you became a teacher?    Ms. Dorrer: Well, I remember my first day of school, going to the old Thompson's Grove School, which was off of -    Ms. Wikoff: It's off of Route 537.    Ms. Dorrer: It's off of 537, and it was a little one-room school. The teacher, Miss Lewis, I imagine she didn't have much education, but she was a very nice person, and tried very hard, but she surely wasn't as much educated as teachers are now.    Ms. Wikoff: They didn't have to be.    Ms. Dorrer: They didn't have to be. So I went in, and all my family started in that school, but most of us went on to Freehold. We had to walk from the farm to Thompson's Grove, but when we went to Freehold, we went on the bus, the little old rickety bus, that came and picked us up and took us into town. We didn't have much to do with after school activities because we had to take the bus and go home to the farm.    Ms. Wikoff: My husband Charles's mother was a Thompson, and that Thompson would be her great-grandmother, and her grandparents gave the land for that school - that's why it's called Thompson Grove.    Ms. Dorrer: You know I never knew that was the reason, but it was called Thompson's Grove. And it was the Clayton farm, and now the Clayton farm is being developed.    Ms. Wikoff: I was very disappointed in Mr. Clayton. I asked him personally to save that farm, but the bulldozer operator called me up one morning saying it was going to be demolished and they said that I had to go today if I wanted to protest that. And I said well, what could I do today?    Ms. Dorrer: You know he went to that school, I know how you tried to keep that from being torn down. I sat in his living room for an hour and a half, begging him  I almost got down on my knees…    Ms. Wikoff: See, I didn't know that. We could have done it together, and, today I think if we had used a little bit of -    Ms. Dorrer: Well, I almost got down on my knees to him, and he said that there was too much red tape about antique buildings.    Ms. Wikoff: Isn't that a shame?     Ms. Dorrer: And he was such a wealthy man, and a long time resident of that area and you know I cried, I really did. I didn't realize that you and I could have worked on that -    Ms. Wikoff: Yes, I wish I had known that you were trying to save it, also. I was doing it because I had been appointed historian for the Township, and I desperately wanted to save that school because it had so much history with Charles's family, the Wikoff family. Anyway, it went.    Ms. Dorrer: I have a picture I want to show you of when I went there in the early days. And every time I go by there, I go up to the fresh fruit farm to get fruit from Schletwegs, and all those farms up there.    Ms. Wikoff: So that was reminiscing about your earliest childhood in school. Where was the school in Freehold at that time?    Ms. Dorrer: Well, it was on Hudson Street, right near the rug mill.    Ms. Wikoff: Well, my dad went there, and I remember hearing that he had to take the horse and ride in, and they had a place to tie the horses for the school. You see he was a lot older than you were. There was no bus transportation.    Ms. Dorrer: Well, I well remember the high school was on Hudson Street, and the Elementary school was right down the street, not far from that. When I graduated from high school, there were fifty-seven of us, and I graduated in the class of 1923. I'm friendly with the girl who was the president of our class, her name is Dorothy Statsir, and she and I are the only two living members of the class of 1923, we think. We talked the other night because she somehow heard that I had moved from my home in Neptune, or in Sea Girt and she called me.    Ms. Wikoff: Wasn't her father the postmaster in Freehold? Bernard Statsir?    Ms. Dorrer: That wasn't her father, that was -    Ms. Wikoff: Her uncle?    Ms. Dorrer: Something like that. The Statsirs were very well known.    Ms. Wikoff: They were relatives of -    Ms. Dorrer: Bill Statsir was her husband, yes William Statsir.    Ms. Wikoff: The Statsirs were related to Charles's mother.    Ms. Dorrer: Yes.    Ms. Wikoff: And that's a nice background that you - in a way some people say, "Wasn't that a terrible background?" but really it was our upbringing.    Ms. Dorrer: Yes, but I cannot believe that two weeks from today I will be ninety-five years old.    Ms. Wikoff: Really? Well, you deserve a medal for -    Ms. Dorrer: And when I think of the people I've known, and all the associations I've had, it's just wonderful.    Ms. Wikoff: Well, to have this grand memory is worth so much, and then to share it with our people here in Monmouth County who don't know about it is wonderful. I think, as time goes on, people are going to be more and more interested in what it was like here in the old days. What were some of the medical changes?    Ms. Dorrer: Well, you know something, there was a country doctor, well, not a country doctor, but he had an office in Freehold. I can't remember his name right now, but he -    Ms. Wikoff: It wasn't Dr. Lewis?    Ms. Dorrer: No. But Dr. Lewis, I want to tell you about that. I had contact with the person that married Dr. Lewis -    Ms. Wikoff: Oh, sure, Gould, Marianne Gould.    Ms. Dorrer: Well, she called me, and I have a letter in my collection that she wrote to me thanking me for being just such a good teacher when she was little. And her mother had -    Ms. Wikoff: The telephone office -    Ms. Dorrer: The telephone office on Tennent Avenue.    Ms. Wikoff: Yes!    Ms. Dorrer: Yes, but we started something -    Ms. Wikoff: The medical practice -     Ms. Dorrer: Oh, the medical practice. Well, anyhow, of course, once a year they had a doctor come to Thompson's Grove, and I remember lining up. I think this doctor had a nurse or someone with him, and as I passed by, he made a remark to the nurse. He said, "This child isn't going to live long." But, you know, I always said how I fooled him!    Ms. Wikoff: Well, remember they used to look in your ears. It was just a cursory kind of examination, it was a nothing really, but they had to hire the doctor to do it.    Ms. Dorrer: Yes, but, you know even though my father was a farmer and it was not easy getting along, he always tried to see that we were taken to Dr. Anderson, in Englishtown, our doctor. By the way, he was on the Board of Education when I was hired for my first job. And Mr. Aumack was also on the Board of Education. He was Dad's boyhood friend  they went to school together, so I didn't have such a hard job getting a position.    Ms. Wikoff: Well, you know when Mr. Aumack wanted to retire, he came out and saw my husband, Charles, and he said, "Now you have children." We had just started having a family, and he said, "Now you have children and I know you'd be a good school board member," and that's how simple it was in those days, to become a school board member with no connections at all. And Charles dedicated sixteen years of his life to being a school board member.    Ms. Dorrer: And you know my father was president of the Board of Education in Freehold Township when that first school was built on Route 537. And I was always so proud because as you went in the door, there was my Dad's picture. Of course they have thrown it out now. But here was just a plain farmer, and he was President of the Board of Education.    Ms. Wikoff: What I always remember in those days was that they used common sense and good judgment. I mean it wasn't because they were highly educated, but common sense meant a lot when you were building, and when you were making decisions.     Ms. Dorrer: Well, I have to tell you one little incident about Freehold Township. I was teaching in Manalapan Township in Englishtown, of course, and somehow or other someone thought I should come to Freehold Township. And I have a letter that says they would offer me a job for twelve hundred dollars a year.    Ms. Wikoff: That was big money!    Ms. Dorrer: Yes.    Ms. Wikoff: Oh, dear. I think my mother got eight hundred dollars.    Ms. Dorrer: Oh, my goodness. That's terrible.    Ms. Wikoff: And we always said that that just went right into the ground because that kept Dad farming.    Ms. Dorrer: I know.    Ms. Wikoff: It's so silly, but that's the way it worked.    Ms. Dorrer: Of course that's the way it was when I was first married and I was teaching in Englishtown, and we were starting our garage. I used to contribute quite a lot to the garage. And during the War I worked right there with my brother-in-law.    Ms. Wikoff: So, I was going to say that following Dr. Anderson was Dr. Woodruff.    Ms. Dorrer: Yes.    Ms. Wikoff: He was a wonderful doctor, in fact, he delivered all of my children, and then you had to go to Neptune to the hospital. But there might have been one traffic light in Freehold, and I mean you could really get to Neptune Hospital in twenty minutes. But today, if you had to go to Neptune, you'd have the baby before you got there.    Ms. Dorrer: I know. Oh, that's right, I remember. What was the other doctor? Before Dr. Barr, there was an older doctor. Of course, I well remember the inn, which is now just the Englishtown Museum, because there used to be a little lunchroom there. And once in a while, when I had a little extra money, I would go down at lunchtime and have a little lunch. And other times I would go across to Vandenberg's -    Ms. Wikoff: Sometimes I heard you gave lunch to the teachers!    Ms. Dorrer: She made lunch for the teachers, and I paid fifty cents for my lunch. And what a lunch!! You heard Mrs. Vandenberg is such a good cook.    Ms. Wikoff: Yes, such a wonderful family.    Ms. Dorrer: Yes, and the Vandenberg store was in the center of Englishtown.    Ms. Wikoff: And then George Vandenberg married Mildred -    Ms. Dorrer: Mildred Wolfe -    Ms. Wikoff: And she was my teacher, too.      Erma Dorrer during her first year of teaching, 1926  Ms. Dorrer: Yes, Mildred Wolfe and I started teaching about the same time.    Ms. Wikoff: Well, I had her in the first grade.    Ms. Dorrer: Well, I started in the fourth grade and went up from the fourth, fifth, and sixth, and then I got in the eighth grade, and I never could get out of the eighth grade. I don't know what there was about it, my voice, maybe, or was it that I'm six foot tall. So Mildred married George, young George Vandenberg .    Ms. Wikoff: And I was one of the first students to come to that new school in Englishtown, because earlier all the students had to go to the Tennent school in our area. Hamilton and Eleanor had to go to Tennent, but I was able to start in the new school. You know it was a big thing to go to a brand new school!    Ms. Dorrer: Well, I remember when I took my eighth grade examinations in Thompson Road School. We had to go to Englishtown to take our eighth grade examinations. I can't remember who the principal was, but he came over to our farm to tell my mother and father how I had made out in these. And I got the highest marks, and can you believe, from a little old school like that! And I always remember how we learned to read and love books, and how that happened with a background that a teacher had then is amazing.    Ms. Wikoff: Yes. I'm just curious now. You were in the Freehold Township, across the street from Manalapan Township and you went to Manalapan Township schools.     Ms. Dorrer: Well, I think there was some agreement between Manalapan Township and Freehold Township about that school. Oh, but why did they have to tear that Thompson Grove School down.    Ms. Wikoff: I know, we'll never get over that!    Ms. Dorrer: No.    Ms. Wikoff: Okay, let's go on to some of these questions that are kind of interesting. Do you remember the first movie that you ever saw?    Ms. Dorrer: The first movie? You know I don't remember. I do remember that I had an aunt who used to come visit us, Aunt Laura, and she used to take us to the movies on Saturday afternoon, and one thing I can remember is somebody who played the piano - it was somebody that you and I would know, but I don't recall now. But I do not remember what the movies were.    Ms. Wikoff: Well, I remember mine. I remember mostly the Shirley Temple movies - they were so good.    Ms. Dorrer: That was after my beginning that Shirley came on.    Ms. Wikoff: Do you remember anything about FDR - about Franklin Roosevelt's "New Deal"?    Ms. Dorrer: Yes, and I remember when I came home the day that Franklin Roosevelt died. My father was out in the field, with the farm machinery, and I went out and told him that Roosevelt had died. Yes, I remember that.    Ms. Wikoff: And isn't it interesting: I'll bet that neither you and nor I never knew that he didn't stand up by himself…the reporters were so kind, thank goodness to him - do you remember just recently reading that there was controversy when this monument to him in Washington D.C. - whether they should have had him in a wheelchair or not, and of course, they didn't.    Ms. Dorrer: Yes, that was how they got away with that one.    Ms. Wikoff: Now, in today's world, you don't get away with anything. What newspapers made all the names?    Ms. Dorrer: The Freehold Transcript. And I can't remember the name, there was another paper, the Democrat. The Freehold Transcript came out on Thursday, I'm quite sure, and that night was a real important night in our lives because everybody, including my father, had to read The Transcript. And the Center Word column.    Ms. Wikoff: Yes! And then each little area had a gossip column. I'll never forget the one in our area. And you didn't kind of like everybody to know what you were doing. I remember she would call, and she would ask, "Now what did you do over the weekend?"    Ms. Dorrer: Oh, yes, and if anybody ever came to visit -    Ms. Wikoff: She'd put their names in.    Ms. Dorrer: And people came to the farm from far and near. Especially in summertime. You know, some of them came that we didn't want. They'd come to get the nice things we had on the farm to take them back with them. I remember some of them stealing my grandfather's watermelons, and I went in and said to my grandfather, in front of all the farm people who were sitting and having dinner, "I saw such-and-such person stealing your watermelons."    Ms. Wikoff: We had that happen all the time, too. Especially with the pumpkins and the watermelons. There was some charm to be able to steal either pumpkins or watermelons. That's interesting.    Ms. Dorrer: Yes. And I remember my grandfather going right out. I don't know what he did, but anyhow, he took care of that situation. Of course, I was convinced there was a trick.    Ms. Wikoff: I can imagine that you had the same visiting that we had on a Sunday night. I remember that mother would always have a cake ready for Sunday because the relatives would stop in - it was a wonderful time for visiting. It's a shame people don't visit today, but now you have to call somebody first.    Ms. Dorrer: Yes. In the summertime you either had lemonade or iced tea.    Ms. Wikoff: And do you remember when your dad got into haying they would make root beer!      Erma Dorrer on the farm with her horses, 1919  Ms. Dorrer: And then, in the middle of the afternoon, you'd have to take a little refreshment out to them. And that's another thing. My grandfather used to say, "If you needed Erma to do anything, you hook a horse up to it." Because I loved horses, and I rode a horse. Later in life, I learned that children always had so much, but you know, we had one of everything, we had one bicycle, one this, one that, but at hay time, I remember driving the hay fork -    Ms. Wikoff: Yes, and I did too. When you got old enough to do that you were pretty proud of yourself. But that was a talent to be able to do that correctly.    Ms. Dorrer: Yes, and then you drove, and then they'd call to drop the hay into the haymow.    Ms. Wikoff: They'd say, "Whoa!" We can never go back to those times. What were some of the childhood games that you played?    Ms. Dorrer: We had one croquet set, and I remember that was quite a joy to play croquet. And I guess we had our own little games -    Ms. Wikoff: Parcheesi I bet was one.    Ms. Dorrer: Yes, and Five Hundred was quite a game for the older people as I remember.    Ms. Wikoff: We play that today. In fact I played on Saturday night and the women were against the men and we lost, badly!    Ms. Dorrer: No kidding. I didn't realize that they were still playing that.    Ms. Wikoff: Yes, I guess it was just our age group that plays it.    Ms. Dorrer: And you lived in the Tennent area, near the old Tennent church, your mother played the organ, didn't she?    Ms. Wikoff: She played the organ all her life and when I was very, very little, the pews were like box stalls, because I can remember crawling down underneath, because the pew door was locked there and I would like to play with the people's feet in front of me.    Ms. Dorrer: I remember Mr. Neff who was the minister when I was there.    Ms. Wikoff: A saintly man.    Ms. Dorrer: Yes, he was. I went to the Methodist Church in Freehold, and my father took me, I guess I couldn't have been more than three or four years old when I started going with him, and he was very active, he was on the Board of whatever they had in the Methodist Church.    Ms. Wikoff: Did you ever teach Sunday school?    Ms. Dorrer: I had a class of twenty-one girls. I have a picture somewhere - I hear from one or two of them yet, as they were young girls, well, high school, and then there was a Mr. Cobb who had a YMCA in Freehold and he had a boys group that was just the same age as my girls.    Ms. Wikoff: He was very involved in the YMCA. Lee Cobb. I taught Sunday school, and I guess it was good to teach because you were learning what you taught, because I didn't know too much about the Bible.    Ms. Dorrer: I'm not so sure I was too good at it.    Ms. Wikoff: I'm not sure I was either.    Ms. Dorrer: I used to be secretary of a group of ministers from Marlboro, Colts Neck, Englishtown, Tennent, and Ardena. It was an organization of people who were connected with the ministers and the people who were connected with the Sunday schools. I was active in that, too: I loved action and groups.    Ms. Wikoff: Well, let's see if we can recall any other things that were of interest to you. I don't think you had any time to have any hobbies, did you?    Ms. Dorrer: In my church they have what they call a knitters group, and I must have gotten good at it or something because I was always out running a meeting and doing things. But I can't play bridge, everybody I know, all the seniors, play bridge, and I do not play bridge, but I always kept very busy.    Ms. Wikoff: Do you enjoy, as I do, the quizzes on the television shows now, like Jeopardy?    Ms. Dorrer: Yes, I look at those when I have time.    Ms. Wikoff: I do, too.    Ms. Dorrer: But you know there's one thing lacking at my age now. One thing I find is that everyone that I meet has children and grandchildren  I'm finding this very true right now, that I have none. The only person I have now is a sister, and she lives in Baltimore, and she is getting to have ill health as well as her husband. So I'm sort of alone. And one thing that makes many of these people happy, when it comes to the holidays, is that their children and grandchildren take them home with them and get in touch with them, and I have no one.    Ms. Wikoff: Well, it's one of those things that can't be helped. But you've made such a wonderful life for yourself, and so many people do appreciate all that you've done.    Ms. Dorrer: Well, I often think that I must be thankful because even though I don't have children and grandchildren, I have lots of friends. And luckily, I seem to be able to keep some younger friends.    Ms. Wikoff: You were such a good friend to my sister, too.    Ms. Dorrer: Oh, I loved your sister. And she loved me. People were amazed that I had her in school. I love poetry, and I had a contest one time. I had them learn poetry, and she was the best, for some reason, and she won fifty cents. And she went down to the local store and treated two of her friends.    Ms. Wikoff: Well, that was one of the fun things about school in Englishtown: we could go downtown, and if you had five cents, or ten cents, you could get a soda, you could get ice cream.    Ms. Dorrer: I think it was a place called Smith's.    Ms. Wikoff: It was. And then if you went and got a haircut -    Ms. Dorrer: Oh, Jake Troutman -    Ms. Wikoff: - he'd give you a piece of candy! And your girlfriends would go with you because he might give them a piece of candy, too.      Erma Dorrer with her first Ford, 1920  Ms. Dorrer: Another thing I remember. When I drove up in front of the Englishtown school to teach the first day, I had a Model A.  I recently saw a Model A where they have antique cars, and that brought back memories. It had a rumble seat, and I really know that I used to buzz around in that!    Ms. Wikoff: And you know, you could do things that you can't do today. Oh, my goodness. We could really have a lot of fun, well there weren't policemen around, really. There was one policeman for the whole of Manalapan and Englishtown. Oliver McGantlin.     Ms. Dorrer: Vanderhoef!    Ms. Wikoff: Yes, Ray Vanderhoef.    Ms. Dorrer: Vanderhoef, yes.    Ms. Wikoff: And how is he connected with Vanderhoef who played Uncle Sam in all the parades.  You know, the very, very, tall man. No, he was a Burke.    Ms. Dorrer: Burke it was. All the parades. I even remember when the Armistice was signed, the eleventh hour, the eleventh day, the eleventh month. And my father came up to Thompson's Grove and took us to Freehold, all of us in the car, and that was 1918, and I remember it.    Ms. Wikoff: There was such patriotism in those days. During World War II, I can remember I gave blood as much as I could, and of course, my husband, Charles, was in the service.    Ms. Dorrer: And my husband was in the service. I wanted to go in the service myself. Of course, I was doing plenty of work at home, and teaching  and by the way, Teddy Narozanick is very much interested in having a program about the women doing war work - Rosie the Riveter! And you know I'm going to call Teddy, and I'm going to say, "You know they were great, those Rosie the Riveters, but I'll tell you what I was doing. I was teaching a long way from home, then coming home and working until midnight in a garage, and we had a very good business going." There were very few garages -    Ms. Wikoff: The men had gone to war.    Ms. Dorrer: Yes, and ours was known. We were very near Earle, and we had a lot of business from the people working in Earle, and I had many a temptation to go into the black market, but I wouldn't because, after all, my husband was in the service, and I was working for the people, and I wouldn't do such a thing.    Ms. Wikoff: There were people who did not use the gas stamps.    Ms. Dorrer: I wouldn't mention any names, but I know somebody from Englishtown who became practically a millionaire being involved in the tires and gas.    Ms. Wikoff: Yes, there was a lot of that that went on. I can remember those ration stamps were so valuable and Charles's mother and father would save them, and they'd hardly drive the car so that Charles could have these stamps (he was at Fort Eustis in Virginia) to give the person who drove him home. It was an interesting time.    Ms. Dorrer: And you know during that same time, it was customary to have your business near your house, and our garage was near my house, and the oil tank for the house and the garage was all one. And I remember I would keep the heat where I almost froze to death in the house so the men could have some heat in the garage.    Ms. Wikoff: It's something to remember, isn't it? We've had a lot of fun reminiscing here, and I know you're going to have fun showing me the pictures and I am so thankful that you have those one-room school pictures. Just recently, do you remember the one room schoolhouse that was in Tennent?    Ms. Dorrer: Was that out in front of the church? Do you know something - Ryan Aumack, who was the Board of Education President, and my father went to that school.    Ms. Wikoff: We drive by there when we go to church, and there has been a For Sale sign on it, and yesterday, I saw that it had been sold. I don't know if the person who bought it knows that it was a one room school. But we did mark it. It's dated, and I'll have to go and look and see if they left the sign on the house.    Ms. Dorrer: You know there were a lot of one room schools - Paradise, there was one named Paradise, did you ever hear of that one?    Ms. Wikoff: Sure, and then No Chance. Isn't that a terrible name for a school!!    Ms. Dorrer: And Lafayette, was there a Lafayette?    Ms. Wikoff: Yes there was. I've got the list at home. There were five school districts.    Ms. Dorrer: And there were a lot in Freehold Township. I think they're saving West Freehold school. That's up there by Moore's Tavern.    Ms. Wikoff: The Battleground Historical Society actually saved that, and now we've given it back to Freehold Township.    Ms. Dorrer: You have. Oh, why couldn't they have saved Thompson's Grove? Will I ever forget how I sat in there in his living room and I practically got down on my knees and said, "Please don't." He said he couldn't afford it, there was too much red tape.    Ms. Wikoff: Oh, he also said he'd have to pay taxes on it.    Ms. Dorrer: Oh, well, something like that.    Ms. Wikoff: But that's too bad that you and I didn't know what the other was trying to do, because coordinated, hopefully - I don't know - you can't look back. So we'll have fun now looking at your pictures, and I'm so thankful that you do have them to share. And then we're going to have them on display in the Monmouth County Library in the month of November.    Ms. Dorrer: Well, I think that you do know that I gave a nice collection of pictures of one-room schools - it's a really valuable collection that I had. Mrs. Higgins came and got it just as I was cleaning out. Of course I had called Ted and asked him what I should do about it, and he told me whom to call. And she came and picked them up. I can't wait for that display because I helped the man who did that.    Ms. Wikoff: And you had them all with names on them.    Ms. Dorrer: Catalogued and everything, yes. I don't have as many pictures about my early days as I'd like to. I have a lot of when I was active on the State level and all that, but I don't have too many when I was young.    Ms. Wikoff: If you do have some, please let's send them to Mrs. Higgins. I understand that there's a way of putting pictures with this talk.     Ms. Dorrer: I'm looking, of course, going through a lot right now. It brings back so many memories I start crying. I won't be around too much longer, but I'm so glad to see you.    Ms. Wikoff: Well, I am so happy to be able to do this interview I could cry too.    Ms. Dorrer: And I have such great memories of your family. Your mother was the greatest person.    Ms. Wikoff: Well, thanks an awful lot.      
MonmouthCounty;Anna Morford;1904;2001;Anna Morford, 1904, 2001        Remembering The 20th Century: An Oral History of Monmouth County    Date of Interview: July 24, 2001  Name of Interviewer: June West  Premises of Interview: Ms. Morford's home, Red Bank, NJ  Birthdate of Subject: September 3, 1904  Deceased: March 24, 2003    Ms. West: Mrs. Morford was affiliated with the Middletown Township Board of Education as an assistant to the clerk. Mrs. Morford could you tell us a little something about yourself?     Ms. Morford: Well, my family was very small. I just had one brother and we lived in a home on Cherry Tree Farm which was a house that my father had built when he was married in 1895. He and another carpenter built the house  the total cost of a fourteen room house was thirty-five hundred dollars. I lived there until I was married in 1928 and then stayed there for about a year or two before we moved to another home.    Ms. West: You had just the one brother, right? What did your dad do?    Ms. Morford: My father was a farmer.    Ms. West: And your mother was a housewife?    Ms. Morford: She was a housewife, homemaker.    Ms. West: And while your mom and dad are busy working on the farm, what are you and your brother doing, working with chores, or playing, or -    Ms. Morford: Well, until I was old enough to work, we just did nothing but play and fight.    Ms. West: What games did you and your brother play as youngsters?    Ms. Morford: Well, we didn't play together too much because he was eight years older than I, but as children we played tag and hide and seek, and other home games, like croquet  we just occupied our time as children. We didn't have all the activities that children have today. So it was impossible to do much of anything but stay on the farm and just be a nuisance to our parents, I guess.    Ms. West: But would you tell us about Middletown? What was the ambiance at that time?    Ms. Morford: Middletown Township was a farming community and most of the residents were farmers. All the surrounding people where we lived were farmers. And they didn't do much of anything but farm.    Ms. West: How was the terrain at that time?    Ms. Morford: Well, as I say, it was open territory, open farms, open land, and not many hills and not much water, no rivers or anything, a few brooks. A brook ran in back of our property. It was pretty flat and not much different than what it is today.    Ms. West: In a past conversation you mentioned about the plank road. Would you tell us something about that?    Ms. Morford: There were roads, back in those days  some of them were built with wooden planks. And there was one road in particular that my father always referred to as the "Plank Road," and it ran from New Monmouth right across from St. Mary's church down to Port Monmouth. It was a short trip but it was one of those that my father always called the Plank Road, so I assume that it was originally a road built with wooden planks.    Ms. West: That was apparently the main thoroughfare going from Middletown to Port Monmouth. Could you tell me about your education? What grammar school did you go to at that time?    Ms. Morford: I went to a one room school for five years at Harmony, where there was one teacher for all five grades. The teacher was a man by the name of George Leonard. From there I went to the Leonardo Grammar School over in Leonard through eighth grade, and on through to high school at Leonardo which was a Middletown Township High School. That was all the formal education that I had.    Ms. West: Who were the people in Monmouth County who might have influenced your life? Could you tell us a little something about them and if there is something that you'd like to say to them that you may not have said in past years?    Ms. Morford: I think my role model was my father, and of course we didn't know too many people except the neighbors. My father was very active in education in Middletown  he was on the Middletown Township Board of Education for nineteen years. During that time when I was in high school, of course, I think some of the children thought I was maybe favored because of my father's position, but I'm sure that never occurred. I earned everything I got.    Ms. West: Is there any particular area or location in Monmouth County that has a personal significance to you?    Ms. Morford: Well, really Middletown Village, and the church in Middletown which is now the Old First Church, which was the First Baptist church in New Jersey, and that was where we always gathered for all our social affairs, which were centered around the church. Actually, Middletown was a farming community, and all of the people would go to the church with horse and carriage. Horses and carriages were the only mode of transportation.    Ms. West: Is the church still standing today?    Ms. Morford: Yes, it is.    Ms. West: Talking about your school, in reference to your school, what fond memories might you have regarding that?    Ms. Morford: I think that my fondest memories were when I was a senior in high school and I was on the debating team. We had interscholastic debating at that time sponsored by Rutgers University. And the team that I was on happened to win the championship that year and we were very proud of it. Former Judge LaBrecque was on the same team as I was, and I have very fond recollections of him. We won the championship. That was a highlight of my senior year in high school.    Ms. West: What schools did you debate? Just the schools in Monmouth County?    Ms. Morford: Yes, it was in Monmouth County we debated. Neptune High School, that's the main one I remember. There was Freehold and Red Bank, and several of them in the group.    Ms. West: Being able to be on the debating team means that you must have had quite a bit of knowledge. Did you read a lot?    Ms. Morford: I read quite a bit when I was in school. And we had a very fine English teacher, Miss Susan Williams,  in high school who taught us public speaking and gave us a lot of experience in that respect. So I never seemed to be afraid of audiences. Later in life when I was in political areas I didn't mind getting up in front of a whole big crowd introducing a congressman or a governor or someone that we were interested in. Politics seemed to be my affinity. I liked politics, and I still do.    Ms. West: As a youngster, did you have any favorite books? Or you liked just books in general?    Ms. Morford: Oh, just what we were required to read in high school.    Ms. West: What do you know about your ancestors?    Ms. Morford: I do know that they were very early settlers in Monmouth County. The Hendricksons and the Morfords both were old families and the Hendricksons came from England and my grandmother was a Conover, and that was Holland Dutch. She came from Holland. They came over to this country in the late seventeen hundreds. Most of my family were right around the area  they didn't move very far away.    Ms. West: How was the medical situation at that time? Were hospitals and physicians accessible?    Ms. Morford: No. We had a family doctor who lived in Middletown and my brother and I both were born in the house. We didn't have any hospital experience at all. Until I had my second child, I never went to the hospital.    Ms. West: Who was the first president that you can recall?    Ms. Morford: I think Taft. I remember when I had relatives who lived in Brooklyn and we used to have a big parade there on what they called Children's Day, and I was visiting and standing on the sidewalk and President Taft rode by and he reached down and said, "Hello, little girl," to me, and that was quite a big event in my life.    Ms. West: When you spoke to the President, were you too awe struck to say hello in return?    Ms. Morford: I probably said hello, just shook his hand.    Ms. West: You remember President Roosevelt, I'm sure.    Ms. Morford: Sure.    Ms. West: And all about the New Deal?    Ms. Morford: Oh, yes.    Ms. West: Would you tell us something about that?    Ms. Morford: I don't remember too much about it. I just remember it was part of the history of this country. His planning and all of his ideas. Of course during World War I we had canning clubs and did food preservation and all of that which was very interesting. Herbert Hoover was the Food Administrator at that time. President Hoover. And we used to can. I remember one year we canned about five hundred cans of vegetables - my mother, my sister-in-law and I together. That was our sustenance for the winter. All the canned fruits and vegetables, because we raised a lot of them on the farm.    Ms. West: Is there any particular newspaper headline that might stand out in your memory?    Ms. Morford: I don't recall anything special in my younger years. Of course I remember Pearl Harbor and all that was very tragic and challenging for us.    Ms. West: And Pearl Harbor is related to -    Ms. Morford: It was when Japan bombed Pearl Harbor and started World War II.    Ms. West: Did you take part in the war effort during World War II? Anything special?    Ms. Morford: Yes, I was on the food conservation committee for Middletown and we had to go to different places and teach people how to can and also to teach them how to live on a limited income, which we all had to do at that time. We met in different parts of the town, and the county even, and I even went to the state level one time when I gave a canning demonstration up at Rutgers.    Ms. West: And I imagine by this time you were married?    Ms. Morford: Oh, yes, I was married.     Ms. West: And how many children did you have?    Ms. Morford: Three. Two boys and a girl.    Ms. West: And they are all with us today?    Ms. Morford: Oh, yes. All with us, and I have eight grandchildren. I have eleven great-grandchildren.    Ms. West: Eleven?    Ms. Morford: They range in age from one year to nineteen.    Ms. West: With all these grandchildren and great-grandchildren, do you have any hobbies that you could help them with, you know, participate with them?    Ms. Morford: Well, I don't really participate too much with them because I am so much older and they live not right in Red Bank. Some live a little farther away, in Spring Lake and Pennsylvania, and so I really don't participate too much with them. Two great grandchildren live in Middletown and one great granddaughter in Rumson.    Ms. West: Do you have any favorite songs that you might be hearing?    Ms. Morford: I like the patriotic songs and I like the old hymns. Old familiar hymns.    Ms. West: Were there some of these songs you could have sang with your children and grand children, right?    Ms. Morford: Yes.    Ms. West: If you were to sit down and contemplate your life up to this point, how would you describe it as a road map? Would it have been smooth, rocky, uphill, downhill?    Ms. Morford: We had a lot of rocky times. We had a lot of times when times were pretty rough. My husband had a very small income and I tried to give my children the best education we could. My oldest son went to Peddie school, my daughter went to Glassboro for one year, and then she came back and took a secretarial course and worked as a secretary. And my youngest son went to Monmouth College. He went to Dickinson for a year and then he transferred to Monmouth College and graduated from there. He was a teacher, and is now the president of the New Jersey Food Council. My older son is retired. My daughter is also a housewife, a mother, and lives in Middletown.    Ms. West: What would you say is your greatest achievement?    Ms. Morford: I guess my work in the political arena. I worked with the Republican party and Mrs. Katherine Neuberger, who was a personal friend of mine, who also helped me climb the ladder in the state women's organization. I was second vice-president of the state Republican women. And I think that's the one thing I'm very much interested in all political aspects. I met President Eisenhower and I was very pleased to do that. That was when he was running. He wasn't the president when I met him. I met Nixon and I met his wife. So I think the highlights have been these people of importance that I've been associated with. All the Freeholders represented in Monmouth County I knew very well.    Ms. West: How did you find working with politics? How did you find working with that today as opposed to many years ago?    Ms. Morford: Well, we always said we had good representatives in the older days. Today I think everybody is in it for what they can get out of it.    Ms. West: So at this point the biggest thing was meeting President Eisenhower and meeting President Nixon and his wife. If you could choose a symbol for your life today, what would it be? What would you choose to represent yourself?    Ms. Morford: We had to turn in a paper recently about it and I said you live each day as it comes, and be thankful for all your blessings. I'm very thankful for my family and for my ability to live here in Navesink House and have the care that they give us here. I think that the life expectancy is so much longer than it was. I never thought I'd live to be ninety-six years old. It's a little bit difficult to think beyond that. One of my granddaughters said to me, "Nana, you're going to be the first Morford to live to be a hundred." I said, "I don't know about that."    Ms. West: Looking at you right now you have a pretty good chance. I hope you get to be a centurion - let's see, who would be president then? George W. Bush will be finishing up his first term in office. And then you'll get the letter from the president congratulating you for living so long.    Ms. Morford: I hope he'll win the second time.    Ms. West: What would you say is the most unusual thing about you?    Ms. Morford: I don't think anything is especially unusual about me  I'm just an ordinary citizen, trying to live a good life. As my husband would say, "If you can't say something good about someone, don't say anything." I think that's a very good philosophy.    Ms. West: Did you do much traveling around Monmouth County?    Ms. Morford: We used to go to different towns, Red Bank, of course, and Keyport, and Freehold, down the shore Asbury Park, in the summertime.    Ms. West: What changes have you seen in the county over the years?    Ms. Morford: Oh, it's a great change. The county has built up so, there are so many people now and the whole climate has changed as far as attitudes of people and children. It appalls me to see the children some days, the way they dress and the way they act, and they're irresponsible. We have it right here with our own employees. We have them come to work for a few days and then they don't show up, they don't call or anything, they just don't show up. There doesn't seem to be any responsibility taught to children. At least to a good many of them.    Ms. West: What were the fads of dress in your days?    Ms. Morford: We wore midi blouses and skirts, and I used to play basketball in high school wearing big full bloomers. We always had to be dressed nicely, and when we'd come home from school we'd change from our school clothes to play clothes. On Sunday we had a special dress that we would wear to church, and the dress code seemed to be one of dignity and a little bit more - I don't know how to express it - but a little bit more dignified.    Ms. West: How do you see the youngsters dressing today?    Ms. Morford: Sloppy.    Ms. West: If you had to live your life over again, or if you could, what changes would you make, if any?    Ms. Morford: I can't think of anything in particular  I surely would marry the same man again. My husband was a wonderful man. We were married for almost forty-five years, and had a wonderful family life. My husband was the most thoughtful person in the world.    Ms. West: How long has he been dead?    Ms. Morford: Twenty-seven years, and it doesn't seem possible. He had a heart attack, and died very suddenly. I've always been thankful to the Lord for that because he would have been very unhappy to have me wait on him  he hated to have me wait on him.    Ms. West: Of course it meant too, that he didn't have to do a lot of suffering.    Ms. Morford: That's right, he didn't have to suffer. My older son was with him when he was very ill in the hospital and he said, "If I don't make it, take good care of your mother." He always had me in his thoughts.    Ms. West: Isn't that beautiful? Is there anything that you feel that you still want to accomplish?    Ms. Morford: No. I just want to have good health. My health is very good except for my knees. I have a hard time walking  I have arthritis all through my whole system. Thank goodness, I don't have the pain.    Ms. West: What would you say are the milestones in your life?    Ms. Morford: I think my high school experience was one, my marriage of course was certainly a big milestone, my children are wonderful and they're all nearby so I see them. They're big milestones. My family, thirty-one of us in all, is a very close family. I don't see my great-grandchildren as much as I'd like to, but I do see them and hear from them, and contact them.    Ms. West: What would you describe as the most important legacy that you would leave to your family and friends?    Ms. Morford: I think to live a good, clean life is most important thing there is. To be considerate of other people and to be true to yourself: "To my own self be true."    Ms. West: What concerns you most about the state of the world today?    Ms. Morford: The unrest and the feeling of wanting to be the top man in everything and the unrest and unhappiness with a lot of people. I think it's very unfortunate that we have to have so much stress.    Ms. West: "Wanting to be the top man." Could you elaborate on that some?    Ms. Morford: I don't know how I can elaborate individually, but I think that the countries all have this wish for being the all-powerful country. The United States has that privilege right now, but you wonder how long we can keep it. Other countries are climbing up fast.    Ms. West: What are your ethnic cultures and practices in religious celebrations?    Ms. Morford: I think I've been tolerant and I believe in tolerance and I believe in being friendly to your neighbor. I am a Baptist by birth and conviction. In my religion I enjoy church but I don't go very much anymore because it's too much of an effort, I have to go in a wheelchair and it's a little bit hard to do. I watch church on television.    Ms. West: So you don't physically go to church, but you attend services via the television. Do you have any stories that you could tell your grandchildren and great-grandchildren?    Ms. Morford: I know my great-grandchildren have asked me to tell them about when I was a little girl and what I used to do, and I think that the thing I enjoyed most of all was the family gatherings and the love of each other. The thing that children probably don't understand today is the mode of transportation that we had. We had horses and carriages, and we used to go to church, doctors, shopping, anything that way. My father had a team of horses and that was the only way we could get around, there were no automobiles until I was about eleven or twelve years old when my father bought his first car. So we really were a rural community, no trolley cars or anything like that nearby. When I went to school, I did go down to the trolley at New Monmouth and ride that trolley to Leonardo. We didn't have paved roads or anything like that  it was all dirt and gravel roads, and very dusty.    Ms. West: When did they start having the trolley cars here in the county?    Ms. Morford: Probably eighty or ninety years ago, I think, because I have been out of school for over seventy years, and we had trolley cars then from Red Bank to Campbell's Junction which is in Belford, and they used to have a trolley that went to Highlands and one to Keyport. That was the first trolley that I remember.    Ms. West: What would you say are your deepest values?    Ms. Morford: That's very hard to describe. My values are to live a good life and not to be too greedy. I've never been a greedy person  I don't think I have, anyway.    Ms. West: What are your personal strengths?    Ms. Morford: I think my personal strength is in my faith.    Ms. West: What advice would you give youngsters today and future generations?    Ms. Morford: I think you have to grow up with respect and grow up to be an honest person and not greedy.    Ms. West: How would you like to see the world, this new millennium now? What insights do you have that you would like to share with us or anyone who will click on this website and read this history of yourself?    Ms. Morford: I would like to see the world be at peace and I would like to also see the families closer. It distresses me to read of so many divorces and split up families and that doesn't seem to be a good core for growth and for a good country. You have to have good family life to be a good country.    Ms. West: Now here at the Navesink House, what do you do for pleasure and recreation?    Ms. Morford: I play bridge once or twice a week and we have a great many programs. Of course I am not able to go out and do the things I used to do. We used to go for long walks and walks in the garden. But I use a walker all the time because I'm so afraid of falling. I don't want to fall and break a bone. I've had a broken hip and a broken knee and broken wrist and I don't want any more breaks, thank you. They have entertainment here and they have church services every Sunday, and they have various programs, music, and lectures. As a matter of fact, I have a great-granddaughter who is sixteen, and she wants to come and play a piano recital for us sometime in the near future.    Ms. West: So you have a pianist in the family?    Ms. Morford: That's right. And she's also a swimmer  she's a champion swimmer.    Ms. West: In high school or a club?    Ms. Morford: She's a junior in high school.    Ms. West: Isn't that wonderful. Did you ever have a nickname when you were a youngster?    Ms. Morford: No.    Ms. West: Any favorite toys?    Ms. Morford: No, I don't think I had any favorite toys. I used to love to ride a bicycle. When I got my first bicycle I was so mad I couldn't get on and ride right away, I had to learn to ride a bicycle  you can't just get on and go.    Ms. West: You mentioned going to Asbury Park. Tell us about it.    Ms. Morford: It was a very nice place at that time. The boardwalk was lovely. We used to go sit on the boardwalk and watch the people. The people were something to watch, they were nicely dressed and walked nicely and behaved themselves. They didn't wear the clothes they wear today and they didn't race around the way they do today. It was a nice family outing to go to Asbury Park on the boardwalk. Then when I was older and going out on dates, we used to go to Asbury Park to dance at the casino, and that was a fun time.    Ms. West: What family recollections do you have?    Ms. Morford: The holiday dinners. The Christmas dinners. My grandmother and grandfather and other cousins of my mother and father were married on the same day so we always had a wedding anniversary dinner on the twentieth of December and a Christmas dinner on the twenty fifth, of course. And the family gatherings were always a big part of our lives.    Ms. West: How do you find Christmas celebrations today as in relation to how they were when you were a child?    Ms. Morford: It's all commercial now, everything's commercial, it's about how much money people spend on Christmas gifts for children. We had a very modest Christmas. We hung our stockings, and that was Santa Claus's gift to us, and there were presents to open in the morning. We were allowed to go downstairs, take our stocking down, open them, then after that we had to wait until after dinner before we could open our presents. One nice present was about all we'd get. It would be a doll or doll carriage or something like that. That was a big present.    Ms. West: Is there any particular birthday of yours that stands out in your mind?    Ms. Morford: My twenty-first birthday, of course, I remember that. I became engaged right around that time and later my ninetieth and ninety-fifth have all been big celebrations that my family have provided for me. My eighty-fifth, too. I guess they weren't sure how much more I was going to live, so they better celebrate each one that came along.    Ms. West: In a month you'll be having your ninety-seventh birthday.    Ms. Morford: Right. If I live that long.    Ms. West: Big plans for that one?    Ms. Morford: I don't think so. It's on Labor Day this year, and that's a bad day.    Ms. West: Is there anything else you'd like to tell us?    Ms. Morford: I can't think of anything in particular. I know Monmouth County has changed and grown, almost too much. It used to be a big farming community, but now it's all commercial. We have malls and strip malls and stores and the highway is a very ugly road now. I know I came out from Avon Sunday night with my son and I saw that Highway 35 is just one glitzy light after another advertising some building or some business. There is nothing pretty about it. The Parkway, of course, is still very nice, but the county has changed greatly.    Ms. West: So physically, it's the roads and things that have changed, and the population.    Ms. Morford: That's right. It's a little bit hard to understand why we have to have so many riots and so much vandalism and so forth. People don't seem to respect anybody else's property. It's very upsetting to see the way people go today.    Ms. West: This is more prevalent in the county than when you were growing up?    Ms. Morford: Oh yes. We wouldn't dare. I remember when I was a child we had an old aunt who lived with us, and if I wouldn't say "Please" or "Thank you," my father made me go sit in the corner until I would say it. Now if anybody says please or thank you it's a miracle. I have one great-granddaughter who is always very nice. She says, "Thank you very much, Great Nana." She's very sweet about it. All of my great-grandchildren are very nice, very kind to me, and my grandchildren also. But in general today you don't see the respect that you used to see.    Ms. West: Do you think that will turn around some day?    Ms. Morford: I hope so, but I know I'll never live to see it.    Ms. West: I kind of hope so myself. Maybe people will go the other way when they see what is happening in the world and around. It just can't keep going in the same direction  everything seems to be so adverse.    Ms. Morford: Got to have a bond somewhere and tie them up again.    Ms. West: You were telling me about this picture on the wall. Is that the home that you were born in?    Ms. Morford: That's the home I was born in, and it's still standing today. It is now a doctor's office. My husband's old home in Shrewsbury on Sycamore Avenue is still standing, too.    Ms. West: The home that you were raised in  where is that located in Middletown?    Ms. Morford: It was Cherry Tree Farm on Highway 35 and New Monmouth Road intersection.    Ms. West: Do you know what year your homestead was built in?    Ms. Morford: 1895.    Ms. West: What about the churches, do you know when they were built?    Ms. Morford: The Old First Church in Middletown, was, I think, built in 1832.     Ms. West: Okay. I'd like to thank you for your time, again.    Ms. Morford: You're very welcome.    Ms. West: I'm sure everyone at the library appreciates you giving us your time and sharing in your life. Thank you so much.    Ms. Morford: Thank you.

Mrs. Erickson: 1934.    Mr. Aumack: And what town did you settle in?    Mrs. Erickson: Keyport.    Mr. Aumack: Why did you come to Keyport in 1934?    Mrs. Erickson: Because my husband liked the water, and he was a fisherman.    Mr. Aumack: Where did you move from?    Mrs. Erickson: Lawrence Harbor.    Mr. Aumack: Was he always a commercial fisherman?    Mrs. Erickson: No, he was in the Navy for six years  he was a painter and a welder, by trade.    Mr. Aumack: What did he fish for?    Mrs. Erickson: Everything…lobsters, clams, bait, and all kinds of fish.    Mr. Aumack: Was that a lucrative business back then?    Mrs. Erickson: No.    Mr. Aumack: Describe Keyport in 1934.    Mrs. Erickson: It was just like a fisherman’s village. It was just a beautiful, beautiful town. There are no words, really, to describe it.    Mr. Aumack: So when you say a fisherman’s village, was the main job for everyone fishing?    Mrs. Erickson: Clamming or oystering. There was an oyster house in Keyport, where they sorted oysters by sizes.    Mr. Aumack: Did he make a lot of money as a fisherman?    Mrs. Erickson: Well, just about enough to get along. It was a poor man’s job. (laughter)    Mr. Aumack: It was a poor man’s job?    Mrs. Erickson: Yes. All work and no pay.    Mr. Aumack: Did he have to pay for his own boat and everything?    Mrs. Erickson: Yes.        Ed Erickson on his boat with bunker, April 1949    Mr. Aumack: Wow. Was he ever discouraged and want to quit the fishing business, or did he love it?    Mrs. Erickson: No, he just loved the water.    Mr. Aumack: So it really was a labor of love.    Mrs. Erickson: Yes, it was. I can remember when the children and I would go and get bait. We would get horseshoe crabs. This one time we were in Cliffwood  my two daughters were very tiny then, and all of a sudden we saw Elizabeth going out toward the water. We went to get her. She thought she had sat on a rock, but she had sat on one of the horseshoe crabs. And it was taking her right out into the water!    Mr. Aumack: Oh no. How old was Elizabeth then?    Mrs. Erickson: About three years old. But that’s how big those horseshoe crabs were. Have you ever seen a horseshoe crab?    Mr. Aumack: I have seen them but…    Mrs. Erickson: Well, some of them are immense! And he used to get them for bait.    Mr. Aumack: How long, like a foot long or wide?    Mrs. Erickson: Oh, they were that wide! (she obviously is showing him with her hands) Some of them were really big. Well you can imagine how big a child of three is, and she was sitting on it and going out toward the water. And you know, it was so unusual seeing her not minding me because I wanted her to be away from the water. But there she was, and we had to go grab her.    Mr. Aumack: And the crab was moving at a fast pace?    Mrs. Erickson: Yes, to go to the water. You see it was high tide when they came in, and in low water they were going out to the bay again. (laughter)    Mr. Aumack: Besides his painting and welding, what did he do in his spare time, if you ever had time?    Mrs. Erickson: There was no fun. Years ago you never thought of fun. There was never a television or anything like that  you just worked and worked and worked.    Mr. Aumack: Did you have a job?    Mrs. Erickson: Never.    Mr. Aumack: What did you do?    Mrs. Erickson: I took care of my house and my children. They never came home without me being there to open the door for them.    Mr. Aumack: Now you lived in one of the oldest houses in Keyport?    Mrs. Erickson: Yes, I don’t know how old that house is, but it is still standing.    Mr. Aumack: When you got the house in 1934 did it have any modern features?    Mrs. Erickson: No.    Mr. Aumack: Tell me about the lifestyle, like washing clothes and cooking, etc.    Mrs. Erickson: I enjoyed every day. And you know there is a true saying, "What you don’t have, you don’t miss." And I loved every day of my life, and I still do enjoy life.    Mr. Aumack: That’s good. In 1934 you didn’t have electric washing machines, right?    Mrs. Erickson: Oh, no.    Mr. Aumack: How did you wash your clothes?    Mrs. Erickson: With a scrubbing board.    Mr. Aumack: With a washboard?    Mrs. Erickson: With a washboard, and I still have it. (laughter)    Mr. Aumack: What kind of stove did you cook on?    Mrs. Erickson: An old-fashioned cook stove, a range. And we burned wood most of the time.    Mr. Aumack: So you got the heat from burning wood?    Mrs. Erickson: Yes. And we had one stove, and that was in the kitchen.    Mr. Aumack: For four people…you, your two children, and your husband?    Mrs. Erickson: Right. And later on we got an oil burner for the living room.    Mr. Aumack: When did you get the oil burner for the living room?    Mrs. Erickson: About maybe 1936.    Mr. Aumack: Did that cost a lot of money?    Mrs. Erickson: It did then, I tell you. Everything did.    Mr. Aumack: Was that a luxury?    Mrs. Erickson: That was a lot of money years ago.    Mr. Aumack: Did a lot of other people have oil stoves in their living room?    Mrs. Erickson: Yes. You used to have an oil stove that you could carry around by hand.    Mr. Aumack: A little oil stove?    Mrs. Erickson: Yes, it used to be about that high. And it would have a handle on it so you could carry it from room to room. On the top there would be a vent, where you could let the heat come out more. And we used to open it so we could see shadows on the ceiling.    Mr. Aumack: What did you do when you weren’t washing and cooking?    Mrs. Erickson: Sewing. I made all the children’s clothes.    Mr. Aumack: You made all their clothes? Did you use a machine?    Mrs. Erickson: Yes.    Mr. Aumack: What kind of machine was it, a Singer or what kind?    Mrs. Erickson: Well, the first one I got was by Strawbridge & Clothier  and it came from Philadelphia. It was a treadle.    Mr. Aumack: So you had to operate it with a pedal?    Mrs. Erickson: With my foot, yes, with a pedal.    Mr. Aumack: I’m sure that gave you a lot of exercise!    Mrs. Erickson: Oh, I loved it. Oh, I made everything for them. I made coats, hats, and little bathrobes. And I would be finishing things like that on Christmas Eve  I wanted to get them all done for Christmas.    Mr. Aumack: So, if you wanted to make a winter coat, what would you make it out of?    Mrs. Erickson: Anything I got. Many times I took an old coat, tore it apart, washed it, pressed it, and made it on the wrong side. And it was just like brand new when I finished.    Mr. Aumack: Did you make any blankets or anything like that?    Mrs. Erickson: No.    Mr. Aumack: Did sewing save you any money?    Mrs. Erickson: I didn’t have any money to spend! (laughter) And I have seen the time when I did not have buttons to match the children’s clothes. I would crochet the buttons so they would be a matching color.    Mr. Aumack: Oh, that’s nice.    Mrs. Erickson: So we never went without, even though we had very little money. There was always something there you could work with.    Mr. Aumack: What happened when the Depression hit? When you moved here in 1934, did it really affect your husband’s jobs in terms of fishing, painting, and welding?    Mrs. Erickson: Well, the painting and welding were years before when we first got married. But from 1934 until he passed on, or before he gave up fishing, he always fished. Everything was water.    Mr. Aumack: So it was a pretty steady job, even through the Depression?    Mrs. Erickson: Yes, you could always fish. And you always had something to eat, because there were fish.    Mr. Aumack: Where did he sell his fish?    Mrs. Erickson: New York, Fulton Market. He sent it there.    Mr. Aumack: Fulton Market on South Street, Seaport. Wow, interesting! Do you remember when radio came about?    Mrs. Erickson: Oh, yes, I do. It was such a thrill because we lived in the country. I can remember we used to go shopping once a week, and this was when I was a kid. We used to have a battery, and then we would get that battery charged once a week. And we thought we were like millionaires since we had a radio!    Mr. Aumack: Was that a luxury as well?    Mrs. Erickson: Oh, yes.    Mr. Aumack: Talk about the lamps. When did you get electricity in your house, what year?    Mrs. Erickson: It was there, but I didn’t use it.    Mr. Aumack: Why didn’t you use it?    Mrs. Erickson: I was afraid I wouldn’t be able to pay the bill! (laughter) So I always got kerosene, and that’s what I used. And then the first time we had running water and electricity was when we moved in 1942, where I am today.    Mr. Aumack: And that was still in Keyport.    Mrs. Erickson: Yes, that was still in Keyport, and one block away. We moved with a wheelbarrow and an express wagon. And it was during a blackout. Of course you probably don’t remember the blackouts during the war. You always had to have your shades down and you were always supposed to be inside. Many a time we were coming down the street, and the siren would blow.    Mr. Aumack: Which siren?    Mrs. Erickson: The siren in Keyport. And that meant there was going to be a blackout. And we had to leave everything where it was and go into the house.    Mr. Aumack: Now why would you have to blackout your house?    Mrs. Erickson: During the war!    Mr. Aumack: World War II?    Mrs. Erickson: Yes, World War II.    Mr. Aumack: Now a siren would go off…    Mrs. Erickson: It would alert everyone in town.    Mr. Aumack: And everyone could hear this siren?    Mrs. Erickson: Oh, yes.    Mr. Aumack: And how did they black in their windows?    Mrs. Erickson: You had shades.    Mr. Aumack: Now where did you get this black material  did you paint your shades black?    Mrs. Erickson: No, we just pulled the shades down. Oh, we didn’t have any light! We had no light.    Mr. Aumack: So you had to sit in this house. Could you light your lamps?    Mrs. Erickson: No, everything was supposed to be dark.    Mr. Aumack: Really! Did you do this to protect yourself in some way?    Mrs. Erickson: Oh, yes, everybody did.    Mr. Aumack: Was this to protect yourself from the Germans?    Mrs. Erickson: I imagine it was so  if any airplanes went over, they couldn’t see us since we didn’t have any light.    Mr. Aumack: Were you scared?    Mrs. Erickson: No.    Mr. Aumack: You weren’t scared at all?    Mrs. Erickson: Oh, no. You took life as it came.    Mr. Aumack: Your husband was too old to be involved in World War II?    Mrs. Erickson: Well, he had been in the service for six years.    Mr. Aumack: That was before 1934, ok. So he didn’t have to serve, and he was still a fisherman.    Mrs. Erickson: Right.    Mr. Aumack: When did he stop being a fisherman?    Mrs. Erickson: He was ninety when he passed on, and he quit about twenty years before he passed on.    Mr. Aumack: So he was a fisherman from 1934 to about what year? Do you know?    Mrs. Erickson: There was a lot of pollution then so it kind of knocked it off. It was in the late 1940s that pollution began to really involve the business he was in. But people didn’t want to hear about pollution in those days. He still was a fisherman then, but it began to disintegrate around that time. After he gave up fishing, he worked at the marina. There are several marinas in Keyport, and he worked at one of them.    Mr. Aumack: What did he do at the marina?    Mrs. Erickson: He would tie up boats and so forth. And he also worked in Perth Amboy where he would take tugboats out to the big boats and bring in people from those big boats.    Mr. Aumack: And he would drive or pilot the tugboats?    Mrs. Erickson: Yes, he would pilot them. He also did this in New York, too.    Mr. Aumack: Where in New York?    Mrs. Erickson: I don’t know what street, but he would do the same thing. He worked on a tugboat.    Mr. Aumack: How did he get to New York?    Mrs. Erickson: By bus.    Mr. Aumack: Oh, by bus, ok.    Mrs. Erickson: You would go so far by bus, and then you would go so far by train.    Mr. Aumack: What was the bus company? Do you remember?    Mrs. Erickson: Well, it was a Marathon Bus from Keyport to South Amboy. From South Amboy you could get a train to take you to New York.    Mr. Aumack: What train was it? Do you remember?    Mrs. Erickson: I imagine the Pennsylvania.    Mr. Aumack: The Pennsylvania Railroad?    Mrs. Erickson: Yes. And that’s who he worked for with the tugboats, too. They had tugboats, the company that ran the railroad.    Mr. Aumack: How has Keyport changed?    Mrs. Erickson: It has changed so much.    Mr. Aumack: Can you tell me a few things?    Mrs. Erickson: Well, they have torn down a lot of the old homes.    Mr. Aumack: Which historical homes?    Mrs. Erickson: Those on Beers Street, all those old homes. They tore down old ones, and they put up more modern ones, you know. Well, Keyport changed so much you could hardly describe it unless you had the pictures right in front of you.    Mr. Aumack: When you entered Keyport, do you know how many people were in the town?    Mrs. Erickson: No. You know, I was never interested. All I was interested in was my family. That’s all that I cared for. And you know, I am still that way today. I wouldn’t care if I never went out of my yard. Of course, you have to go out  but it wouldn’t worry me if I had to stay right here. And I know I’ll be here the rest of my life! But I just love my home.    Mr. Aumack: So, can you tell us anything else about how Keyport has changed? Maybe one story, how about the grocery stores?     Mrs. Erickson: Oh, I used to go with a little cart to the grocery store.    Mr. Aumack: What kind of cart was it?    Mrs. Erickson: A cart, because I never drove. It was a two-wheeled cart.    Mr. Aumack: Was it metal?    Mrs. Erickson: Yes, it was metal. I used to go downtown maybe once a week, and I would get all my groceries in this little cart. And I would come back home with it. I can remember one time, in the winter, it wasn’t too bad yet when I went downtown. But when I came back, the sidewalk had frozen. A lot of the people would take one step forward, and then they would slide back. And I had my cart. I was coming down near the Ye Cottage Inn, one of our famous restaurants. As I was coming down the road, I saw my husband coming to meet me because the weather had changed so. And he said, "How are you doing?" And I said, "Oh, I’m doing fine. The cart kept me up!"    Mr. Aumack: What is the name of that restaurant again?    Mrs. Erickson: Ye Cottage Inn. And that’s still a very famous restaurant in Keyport.    Mr. Aumack: How much did groceries cost? What did you buy?    Mrs. Erickson: I always bought staple things. Everything was so cheap then. And when you look back and then see what you are paying for things today, it is amazing. I won’t even buy a lot of things now because I remember what they used to cost! (laughter)    Mr. Aumack: Let’s say instant oatmeal, which costs around two dollars and thirty-nine cents in some places…    Mrs. Erickson: Well, years ago I can remember buying bread for five cents a loaf. I always loved mincemeat, and I would always get that to make mincemeat pie. It used to be about forty-five cents a box. It came in a box, and you added water, sugar, and things like that to it. Now I forget what it costs, but I won’t even buy it. I’ll make apple pie and put raisins in it. (laughter)    Mr. Aumack: Do you have any advice that you want to give to the younger generation?    Mrs. Erickson: Just be grateful for what you have every day.    Mr. Aumack: Why should we be grateful?    Mrs. Erickson: We are alive! And be happy, too. Be grateful for what you have, even if it’s only a little, because it’s something.    Mr. Aumack: Thank you very much.    Mrs. Erickson: You’re welcome.    Mr. Aumack: Now I am ready to move on to Betty Hurlbert. Betty, when were you born?        Mrs. Hurlbert: 1929, the year of the Depression.    Mr. Aumack: Now, how is it that you came to Monmouth County?    Mrs. Hurlbert: My parents moved to Keyport in 1934.    Mr. Aumack: Now describe living in Keyport as a young girl. What did you do?    Mrs. Hurlbert:  I began school in 1934, and I wasn’t quite five years old then. I just made the entrance date. The school was a two-room schoolhouse. It was the West Keyport School on Washington Street, which has since burned down. It is no longer in existence. Our teacher was Miss Elsie Marshall, and she taught three grades in one room. And, when I began first grade, there were only eight of us. And there were no Black children.        	      West Keyport Schoolhouse, 1954     Betty Jane Hurlbert, 1952    Miss Marshall, first grade teacher  Mr. Aumack: Why not?    Mrs. Hurlbert: There were no Black families in the neighborhood.    Mr. Aumack: Were they allowed in the neighborhood?    Mrs. Hurlbert: Surely. But I didn’t know any Black people growing up because there weren’t any in our neighborhood. My sister was in first grade when I was in third grade. And I still marvel today at the teacher being able to teach the three grades in one room. But it had no effect on our education because, when we went to the grammar school at fourth grade, we were able to keep up with the other students.        First, second, and third grade classes in Keyport, 1934    Mr. Aumack: When you were in second grade, how many students were there in each class?    Mrs. Hurlbert: That I don’t remember. Well, it wouldn’t have changed much  and there were eight in our first grade class. There wasn’t that much influx in the neighborhood so the number remained approximately the same.    Mr. Aumack: So it would be about eight people all through to the point where you got into the fourth grade.    Mrs. Hurlbert: Yes.    Mr. Aumack: When you got to fourth grade, were these all Keyport students?    Mrs. Hurlbert: Yes.    Mr. Aumack: Now what school was that?    Mrs. Hurlbert: That was the Keyport Grammar School, which is also no longer there. To this day, I remember my first grade teacher. She always wore navy or black shirtwaist dresses with a white collar. Her hair was snow white and worn in an upsweep, and she wore black oxford shoes and black stockings. Even when I graduated from high school and went back to visit her, she still looked the same! (laughter)    Mr. Aumack: Describe growing up without all the modern conveniences. What was it like before electricity came, was it easy? Tell us about that.    Mrs. Hurlbert: That I don’t remember as much. I do remember my mother heating the water for our baths, and so forth. She would heat it in a large tub on the wood stove. And not having inside plumbing, we had to use the tub for our baths. We had an outhouse when we first moved to Keyport, also.    Mr. Aumack: And this was in 1934. Please go on.    Mrs. Hurlbert: Of course, growing up in those years, I didn’t like the outhouse because it was an inconvenience going outside. So I remember that very vividly. And I also remember not having central heating. It was very cold going upstairs at night into bed. Mother sometimes would put a hot water bottle or heated bricks in the bed so the sheets would be warmer. I remember, too, the neighborhood. It was a very safe neighborhood. Also, we had no playground equipment at the school. We used jump ropes. The back of the school had beach plums. We would pick those in the spring, and we would pick the wild strawberries. We would just run around in the school yard. We had no organized activities at all.    Mr. Aumack: What other things did you do as a child to pass the time? Can you think of anything else?      Betty Hurlbert  Mrs. Hurlbert: Because my sister and I were only two years apart, we always played together. The children in the neighborhood would come in the summer evenings and play ball in the street, and they allowed the little ones to be the outfielders and catch the balls and throw them in. And the boys that were there, they later went into the service. Some did not come back, unfortunately. But there was no organized recreation for the children. There were no tennis courts to learn tennis. Children did go ice skating in the winter. Because my father was a fisherman, we enjoyed going along with him sometimes. He would row. He didn’t always have a motor in the boats until he had bigger ones. It was quiet and peaceful, and you could see the fish swimming in the water and the birds in the meadows. That part I remember, and I just loved it. My sister and I also had our own rowboat so we learned to row early. In 1942 when we moved to Washington Street we had our own dock on the Matawan Creek. So we had the rowboat, and we could row back and forth. And that I enjoyed doing so much! We could go crabbing in the summer time, and we could catch baby blue fish from the dock. So those activities around the water I remember most fondly.    Mr. Aumack: Now discuss seeing what happened to the town in World War II. You mentioned several friends of yours that died during World War II. What did World War II do to the town?    Mrs. Hurlbert: Well, so many of the young men left for service. For instance, when I graduated from Keyport High School in 1946, eleven of that graduating class were going into service.    Mr. Aumack: How big was the class, do you remember?    Mrs. Hurlbert: Seventy-five students.    Mr. Aumack: So eleven went into the service?    Mrs. Hurlbert: Eleven of our class went into service. And in our neighborhood, too. The police chief lived across the street from us on Broadway  his son never returned. Our next-door neighbor, Johnny Johnson, never returned. We children had been learning in geography classes about foreign places  suddenly people that you knew were in Italy and Africa and sending pictures home of the Sphinx in Egypt and so forth. So the world became much closer to you although the war itself actually seemed far away. And my father was an air raid warden. During the blackouts he would check the neighborhood to make sure all the lights were out at that time. And then, of course, there was the thrill of hearing the war was over  many young men did come home. I would also like to mention that I came across a receipt for my eighth grade graduation dress recently. At that time girls took home economics in the seventh and eighth grades. In the seventh grade you learned to make an apron and cocoa. In the eighth grade, everyone was required to make her graduation dress. My mother had done all the sewing in our family  until this day, I have never learned to sew very well. So, making the graduation dress was somewhat of a struggle! But, you will be interested in the cost. The teacher bought 112 yards of material at  seventy-nine cents a yard. And to be economical she bought fabric with some marks on it. She was allowed a twenty percent discount for that. Her name was Mrs. Ward  I am sure she thought we could work around those marks, and they would never show. And this was in June of 1942 when I graduated. So each girl was charged two dollars and twenty-nine cents for the material. There was one and seven-eighth yards of lace at twenty cents, and that amounted to thirty-seven cents. One spool of thread was five cents, and one pattern was fifteen cents. This was a total of two dollars and eighty-six cents for each girl.    Mr. Aumack: That is what you had to pay?    Mrs. Hurlbert: Yes, two dollars and eighty-six cents for the materials for the eighth grade dress. Each girl looked the same  we wore a flower corsage, which was provided by the school, if I remember correctly. And the ribbon on the corsage was red, white, and blue.    Mr. Aumack: Was it a problem to ask for that money, or did you have enough?    Mrs. Hurlbert: At that time we had enough money for the two dollars and eighty-six cents.    Mr. Aumack: Talk to us about the Keyport School system.    Mrs. Hurlbert: Today, they are criticized for their scores.    Mr. Aumack: What do you mean by "scores"?     Mrs. Hurlbert: The state ratings or rankings. I found the teachers to be wonderful. And I was very fortunate that I was able to be an honors student with the teachers’ encouragement through the years. I recall, especially, a teacher named Miss Janet Stark. She is still alive today, and her name is Janet Collins now. When she learned I was not going to be able to go to college for financial reasons, she asked if there was something she could do to help. But at the time I said I didn’t think there was anything she could do. A short time thereafter on the bulletin board of the high school was a notice from the Packard School of Business. It said they were offering scholarships. Now at that time there were no guidance counselors in the school system. So the students didn’t really learn what was available to them. In our graduating class only eleven went on to higher education at that time. And girls didn’t go to college that much then. I asked Mrs. Collins if she thought I should apply, and she said, "Of course." I had an aunt who said she would take me into New York City. So I took the exam. There were 180 people who took it, and there were only eight scholarships given out. And I ranked fourth when the results came. The teacher was so excited! Years later, she commented in a newspaper article that so many students didn’t know what was available to them. So thank goodness today they have the guidance counselors to help them. I became a secretary in the beginning of my career.    Mr. Aumack: Where was your first job as secretary?    Mrs. Hurlbert: It was in Freehold Borough. I should add that my cousin worked in Freehold at the Lawyers Title Company, and she got me a summer job there. Those were the days before photocopiers and dictaphone machines. I had taken shorthand and typing in high school, and I would recommend taking these to everyone. In those days when they did title searches, they copied in shorthand from the books at the Courthouse. That building is now the Hall of Records. We copied the deeds and wills, if they affected the property, in shorthand. Then we went back to the office, typed on manual typewriters from the notes, and then proofread them with someone. And it was wonderful, because you really could go whenever you wanted to in the Courthouse. When you got tired of typing, you would go back and do more in shorthand. Because the office had no air conditioning, we were allowed to go to the drugstore on Court Street and have a coke or sundae  the supervisor didn’t mind if we took time off because it was very hot. And it was wonderful that from Keyport we had bus transportation. That was the Rollo Company. So I didn’t need a car, and I didn’t have one until 1953 because we had bus transportation.    Mr. Aumack: Did your family ever have a car?    Mrs. Hurlbert: My father drove and had his license, but we never owned a car. We always had a boat. There was bus transportation to Perth Amboy, where the department stores were, to Red Bank, and to Freehold. And we had access to the trains to New York City.    Mr. Aumack: So a lot of families in Keyport, especially you, never really needed a car because the community transportation and mass transit were just so wonderful?    Mrs. Hurlbert: Yes. And we walked to school.    Mr. Aumack: How far did you walk?        Betty Jane and Elizabeth, 1940    Mrs. Hurlbert: The high school was about a mile from our home. I can’t recall snow days, but I hated it because we had to wear snowsuits. In those days they were called snowsuits, and today they are called skisuits. And we would have to wear galoshes. We would trudge through the snow, and we’d get there sometimes wet, but we were in classes.    Mr. Aumack: Was school ever cancelled due to snow?    Mrs. Hurlbert: Not that I recall.    Mr. Aumack: Do you ever remember a day when you walked through a foot or more of snow?    Mrs. Hurlbert: You would have to walk in the road then where the cars packed the snow down.    Mr. Aumack: There wasn’t a lot of traffic then.    Mrs. Hurlbert: No, there wasn’t a lot of traffic in those days.    Mr. Aumack: Did you always work at that law office?    Mrs. Hurlbert: No, that was just for the summer. That was wonderful because I had received a scholarship, which was for full tuition. Graduation presents paid for my books, and my summer job paid for the transportation to New York City.    Mr. Aumack: Oh, that’s where the school was?    Mrs. Hurlbert: In New York City. Packard School of Business, which is no longer in existence.    Mr. Aumack: Do you remember where it was?    Mrs. Hurlbert: On Madison or Lexington Avenue. And my very first job was in the Keyport Public Library. And it was many years after that I became a special librarian, and then later a public librarian. It was considered an honor to work in the library in those days because Keyport had very few places for people to work. You either worked in Newberry's, the five-and-ten cent store, the two banks, or an insurance company. Employers would call the school, and they would ask for the honor students, mostly, to be interviewed. I didn’t take the banking job at that time, but I was interviewed for the Keyport Banking Company.    Mr. Aumack: How long was the Keyport Library in existence before you took the job of librarian? First of all, let me ask you another question to be more clear, and so you understand me. When did you take a job at the Keyport Library? Which Keyport Library was it, and do you remember the year and your job title?    Mrs. Hurlbert: I was librarian’s assistant, and it was during 1945 to 1946. I worked three hours after school, for  three dollars a week.    Mr. Aumack: So this was during high school?    Mrs. Hurlbert: Yes, my senior year.    Mr. Aumack: What was the library like?    Mrs. Hurlbert: It hasn’t changed. There are two floors. Upstairs there is a large room with the reference desk. Downstairs is the children’s department.    Mr. Aumack: Why has it stayed the same?    Mrs. Hurlbert: Space restrictions and costs. It’s not a member of the Monmouth County Library system.    Mr. Aumack: Has staying the same been for the better, or would you have liked it to improve?    Mrs. Hurlbert: Having worked for the Monmouth County Library, I would have liked to see them have more books for the students. But they are able to get them from the state library, so they are not suffering. It's a wonderful place for children.    Mr. Aumack: When did you first work at Monmouth County Library? Which library was it, and what was your job title?    Mrs. Hurlbert: The Eastern Branch, in Shrewsbury. I started in November of 1986.    Mr. Aumack: Was that as librarian’s assistant or were you a librarian?    Mrs. Hurlbert: Reference librarian.    Mr. Aumack: How long did you hold that job?    Mrs. Hurlbert: Until I retired on February 1, 2000.    Mr. Aumack: Congratulations! Discuss the changes in the Eastern Branch Library in Shrewsbury from 1986 through 2000, both good and bad, please.    Mrs. Hurlbert: Technology certainly changed things. At first we had book catalogs with computer printouts. When a patron would ask if we had a book, we had to look in the book catalog. Plus, there were the supplements. Then, of course, it all became computerized, which was wonderful. Now with the Internet you have access to so much information. So I was happy to see the changes.    Mr. Aumack: So they were changes for the better.    Mrs. Hurlbert: For finding information. But the books will always be used.    Mr. Aumack: Would you like to talk more about the library, anything that you remember?    Mrs. Hurlbert: In the Keyport Public Library?    Mr. Aumack: Yes.    Mrs. Hurlbert: The librarian was Miss Elsie Stout  her father worked for the Public Works Department in Keyport. And with all the snow, I think the town only had one truck, but Mr. Stout kept the roads clear. Her name is now Johnson, and she lives in Florida  we still keep in touch. The librarian was wonderful to me and provided me with a love of the library. I didn’t plan to be a librarian at that time. Once a week, when I did book mending, my job was to go to a local drugstore called Hoffman’s, which is no longer there, to buy sundaes for all employees, and the librarian paid for those. I thought, as a teenager, that it was wonderful to treat your employees like that. When I left after graduation from high school, my sister took my position.    Mr. Aumack: Hey, that was lucky! Can you discuss the changes that happened in Keyport, both good and bad? And why do you think the changes have occurred in Keyport?    Mrs. Hurlbert: Growing up, the names were Erickson, Hendrickson, Hansen, Peterson, Christoffersen, Olson, Johnson, Wilson, Robinson, Mason. At that time, I didn’t think it was strange. Many of these people were connected with the water, either with marinas, fishing, or boat building. As the need for wooden boats declined, people went to other locations for their positions, and different people moved in. As people became older, some of them could no longer afford the beautiful Victorian homes on First Street. Some of these houses became apartments, and they deteriorated. Bus transportation ceased. Only now some young people are moving into Keyport because the homes are affordable. They are restoring these homes, and I am delighted to see them. My mother only allowed me to attend Shirley Temple movies at Saturday matinees. Later on, of course, the motion picture industry declined. And in most towns the theaters ceased being there. Our only one, before it went out of business, showed x-rated movies, which I did not attend. There is no theater in town now.     Mr. Aumack: There is no theater in Keyport?    Mrs. Hurlbert: No.    Mr. Aumack: Who started the restoration project of the homes in Keyport?    Mrs. Hurlbert: Back in the early 1970s, the Keyport Historical Society was formed, and there became a greater interest in the older homes. As I said, because the real estate values are lower, now younger people are appreciating the Victorian homes and restoring them.    Mr. Aumack: What would you like to say to the younger generation or anyone who is going to read this, especially Monmouth County residents? Do you have any advice?    Mrs. Hurlbert: My advice to Monmouth County residents would be to preserve the open land.    Mr. Aumack: I do agree with you on that one. In a few sentences or less, tell me about what your life in Monmouth County has been like.    Mrs. Hurlbert: My life in Monmouth County has been wonderful. I have no regrets at all growing up in a small town. The people were wonderful. I also appreciate the fact that, even today, I have a friend from first grade. People tended to stay together more and value their families and friendships then. I liked the feeling of safety and security. Although we didn’t have a lot of money in my early years, we had all that we needed. We always had a garden  we had chickens during the war, and fish was abundant. I grew up on lobster, which is a luxury today. So I am very grateful for having had those experiences. My county working experiences in Freehold at the Lawyers Title Company, at the Keyport Public Library, and with Monmouth County Library have been most enjoyable. I have no complaints about my life, and I am grateful for it.    Mr. Aumack: Thank you very much.    Mrs. Hurlbert: You are welcome.    Mr. Aumack: And now we are here with Elizabeth Walling, formerly Elizabeth Erickson. First I would like to start off with your birthdate.    Mrs. Walling: August 5, 1931.    Mr. Aumack: Now where were you born?    Mrs. Walling: In Columbus, New Jersey.    Mr. Aumack: Is that outside Monmouth County?    Mrs. Walling: Yes.    Mr. Aumack: When did you come to Monmouth County?    Mrs. Walling: 1934.    Mr. Aumack: With the rest of the family?    Mrs. Walling: Right.    Mr. Aumack: Alright. Now discuss the change in the supermarkets in Keyport.    Mrs. Walling: The big thing was, when I was a little bit older and not when I was really young, my job was to go down with mother once a week to help carry the groceries back. We had an A & P, an Acme, and a lot of stores in the town. The one thing that always fascinated me was that there were no adding machines. If you had a big list of things, the clerk would keep writing on the bag everything that you ordered and bought, and he/she would add it up in a few seconds. And that is what you paid.    Mr. Aumack: So he/she was able to add like twenty things really fast?    Mrs. Walling: Oh, yes.    Mr. Aumack: What year was this, do you remember?    Mrs. Walling: Well, it was before 1948. I just can’t remember exactly, but that was part of my job.    Mr. Aumack: Do you remember if that was before World War II?    Mrs. Walling: Yes.    Mr. Aumack: And were the A & P and Acme the only markets in town?    Mrs. Walling: There were several fish markets, and there was a meat store. The one fish market is still there, it’s called Keyport Fishery. The proprietor is Bob Wilson. The son of that owner still has it today. There were dress stores, shoe stores, and several shoe repair shoes in Keyport. It is very self-contained. They have a volunteer fire department, they have a volunteer first aid department, and you can walk to the schools, because Keyport is only like a mile square.    Mr. Aumack: Oh, really? Has it gotten bigger since then?    Mrs. Walling: No. It’s still the same. The only change is that there isn’t as much land available anymore. There isn’t as much green space available.    Mr. Aumack: From 1934 to the year 2000, it has stayed one mile square?    Mrs. Walling: Yes.    Mr. Aumack: Wow!    Mrs. Walling: One side can’t change, because it’s on the Raritan Bay and the Matawan Creek. And the town is close to it.    Mr. Aumack: Now, discuss your father’s fishing business more.        Ed Erickson mending a pound net in Raritan Bay    Mrs. Walling: When we were growing up, he had a boat called Kitsu, and he always docked it at a little place in Keyport. Right close to us was a little beach, and it was alongside of the Kofoed Marina. But we considered that to be our beach, for exploring, playing, and picking wild plums. I always loved the water, and I guess I was the tomboy who liked going and working with the lobster pots. And then when he would sell some, I would help. When people wanted them, you would wade them out and take the money for them. I would go with him while he set the pots, and I would take a jar of water and maybe a sandwich, and I would sit in the rowboat. We would sit in the rowboat until the tide changed, because you would have to pick them up at a certain time, or sometimes you would lose the lobsters. He had pound nets out in the Raritan Bay, and you had to get a license for those, to fish there, to have poles in the water.    Mr. Aumack: Was that for fishing of every kind of marine life?    Mrs. Walling: Whatever would be in that area. You would have the pound nets, and they would have like a heart, and the fish would have to go into them. Actually, people weren’t allowed to do crabbing or anything off of those poles. But they did, and sometimes they would go and lift the nets. And this was stealing, because you had a right to be there.    Mr. Aumack: Would people come from Keyport and steal?    Mrs. Walling: Well, people with boats would go and try to take out some of the things that would be in our net.    Mr. Aumack: So they would bring like a net on a pole?    Mrs. Walling: Right. Then from there, like if we had the moss bunkers, you would go to Belford down to the Co-op. And my father was part of the Co-op that was started in Belford. They would pay you so much per pound for those.    Mr. Aumack: Now is this for lobsters, crabs, and oysters?    Mrs. Walling: Whatever things you were taking in. Lots of times in later years, there would be a run on bunkers a certain season of the year. And that was used for fertilizer, oil, and different things.    Mr. Aumack: We have heard that your father took fish to the Fulton Street Market in New York City.    Mrs. Walling: Right, that’s when I was small, and I don’t really remember those things. But we always had plenty of fish at home. And if you didn’t like it, that was too bad. We always had different kinds of fish. We had shad fish, and some people would say that is so bony. But it’s delicious. Mother would bake the whole shad. Or we would just get a bushel of crabs, boil them, sit at the table with newspaper, and pick out crabmeat. That was our meal, and today that would be quite a luxury.    Mr. Aumack: Yes. So back then you had for free what now people would pay a lot for.    Mrs. Walling: And there were soft-shelled crabs, and you sometimes could get soft-shelled lobsters.    Mr. Aumack: What types of marine life did you feast on, for free, that your father caught?    Mrs. Walling: Weak fish, shad, blue fish, crabs, lobsters, and eels.    Mr. Aumack: What about trout?    Mrs. Walling: No, that would be fresh water. But you saw lots of things besides what you caught, like sea horses. I had dried out several seahorses as a kid, and I still have them today. I glued safety pins onto the back of them, and I still have them today. We would see lots of starfish, too.    Mr. Aumack: How big were the seahorses?    Mrs. Walling: They were just about two inches, they were small ones.    Mr. Aumack: Now you talked about the Kofoed Marina. Is it gone?    Mrs. Walling: Yes, I believe it is. It is Peterson’s Boat Basin today.    Mr. Aumack: Alright. You had mentioned that you went eeling with your father. How did you help your father?    Mrs. Walling: I would help row, but I would also help lift the eel cars. You would dump them into another bucket or something that you had in the rowboat. You would rebait them with the horseshoe crabs that would have to be chopped into four pieces. And then you would reset them again.    Mr. Aumack: So you would catch eels with horseshoe crab meat?    Mrs. Walling: Yes, or killies, or spearing. Whatever came in, you would have to divide them up. The killies you would put in one pail, and the eels would go in another place, etc.    Mr. Aumack: Killies are small fish?    Mrs. Walling: Yes, you use them for bait when you are going fishing. Spearing is a small, silvery fish. And the small eels would be used for bait, too, but the big ones you could use for eating. You would have to skin them. Many times he would have a box of sand, and you would cut the heads off them, and keeping them in the sand, you would pull the skin off it. And then you could cut them up. You would put them either in egg or flour, and then you would fry them. Delicious meat! He also did a lot of hunting when we were growing up. He would go out for rabbits, and you would skin them. Rabbit is very delicious meat. And he would go muskrat hunting, and you could sell their pelts. You would have to skin them, stretch them, and let them cure. But then you could sell the pelts. We always had a hound dog, and we always had a couple of other dogs. And I always loved all the pets. One time both our dogs had puppies, and I thought I was the greatest kid in school, because we had thirteen dogs at one time. That included all the puppies, but we didn’t keep them all. And my father would go deer hunting, and he really didn’t have to go very far. There was so much farm land and everything around then.    Mr. Aumack: Is this late 1930s and early 1940s?    Mrs. Walling: Yes.    Mr. Aumack: What was surrounding Keyport at that time? We know that you lived near the water, because Keyport is mostly surrounding by water. Which towns or farmland surround Keyport?    Mrs. Walling: If you were going to go shopping, the big thing was to go to Perth Amboy on the Marathon Bus. And that would be a big trip to go to Perth Amboy on the bus. They had big department stores in Perth Amboy at that time.    Mr. Aumack: What did they have?    Mrs. Walling: They had Reynolds, Woolworth’s Five & Ten, and several other five-and-ten stores. They had a big movie theatre, furniture stores, and lots of banks. The train also went through Perth Amboy, and the train also went through Keyport. The train was actually running in Keyport when I was in college. I would take the train some days to college.    Mr. Aumack: How long did it take from Keyport to Perth Amboy?    Mrs. Walling: Probably a good half-hour. And they were very crowded lots of times.    Mr. Aumack: So you used a hound dog to hunt?    Mrs. Walling: Yes.    Mr. Aumack: Did you hunt by yourself?    Mrs. Walling: No. I didn’t even go with my father. I wasn’t allowed to do that. He would go with the dog. He would always say you couldn’t make a pet out of the hound dog because she wouldn’t hunt then. But that didn’t get across to me, because I would get right in the doghouse with it. I loved the dogs! And I have had every kind of pet.    Mr. Aumack: So you also ate rabbits  did you eat the muskrat?    Mrs. Walling: I don’t think we did. I think at that time, we were mostly keeping them for the pelts.    Mr. Aumack: Do you know what he did with the rest of the muskrat?    Mrs. Walling: I don’t know.    Mr. Aumack: What about the deer, was this for the family?    Mrs. Walling: Yes.    Mr. Aumack: Oh, ok. So the hunting was for sustenance!    Mrs. Walling: It was for our food. It wasn’t a sport in those days.    Mr. Aumack: When did he stop hunting?    Mrs. Walling: As the developments and things moved in, you weren’t allowed to just go hunting. You had to have a license for hunting then, and you would have to go further. And I think that’s what really stopped hunting then. It was the developments around the area.    Mr. Aumack: Do you remember a year?    Mrs. Walling: No, but it was probably before the 1940s. I don’t think he went deer hunting after we moved to Washington Street.    Mr. Aumack: What about the fishing job he had? Did he stop fishing, and do you remember when and why he stopped?    Mrs. Walling: In later years, like the late 1940s, he would complain to whoever would listen, because there weren’t any organizations to complain to. Now and then we would have a lot of rain, and the Matawan Lake would open its dam and let the fresh water out. Well that fresh water would kill the killies, because they were a salt-water fish. Plus, it would do something regarding taking the oxygen out. So he would go down, and there might be thousands of killies dead. And that would have been a lot of labor catching those, plus he had a marina in Perth Amboy he always sold to. The man came over by boat, and he would get boxes and boxes of killies. But nobody wanted to listen to his complaints. People would dump oil and things up around Matawan, and it would come down the Matawan Creek, and then it would kill off the bait.    Mr. Aumack: They just dumped it?    Mrs. Walling: Well, nobody really thought you could harm the water then. They didn’t think it was very important. People thought it was just there, it had always been there, and it would always be the same. They didn’t realize that dumping things into the water would kill the marine life. In fact, years ago, there were sharks. In some of the information about Matawan, there was a shark that had gone up that Creek and had actually taken somebody’s leg off! And we’ve had a dolphin up in the Creek.    Mr. Aumack: In Matawan Creek?    Mrs. Walling: Yes.    Mr. Aumack: Now they opened Matawan Dam so it wouldn’t flood over?    Mrs. Walling: Well, after a lot of rain, it would be too high. So they would open it, and it would have to flow down the Matawan Creek.    Mr. Aumack: What did these occurrences do to your father’s business?    Mrs. Walling: They killed it. So then he was more or less into just renting slips for boats.    Mr. Aumack: So that’s what he did. So when did you own that dock?    Mrs. Walling: When we moved to Washington Street. It was really not a dock then, but we would kind of build it up a little each year. And it got to the point where he had probably about twenty-five boats there.    Mr. Aumack: And people paid him to keep their boat there.    Mrs. Walling: He was the only man fighting the pollution. He showed them all the things that were dead, but they said there wasn’t anything they could do, because there weren’t enough people fighting it. He told them there would be a day when the whole bay would be polluted, and it was.    Mrs. Walling: And then in later years, they just sold off the meadowland, which is where his dock was. And now it is called The Brown’s Point Marina. And mother still has a good piece of property. Could I tell you about the ice man?    Mr. Aumack: Yes, please tell me about the ice man.    Mrs. Walling: When we lived over on Broadway, back in the 1930s, you didn’t have a refrigerator. We had an icebox. If you needed ice, you had a little card, and you would put it in your front window. This would say how many pounds of ice you wanted when the ice man went around. If you forgot to dump that water pan underneath the icebox, you were in trouble, because it would be spilling all over the floor. But the sink was pretty close to that. Well, we would go and ask him if he had any slivers of ice. And many times, he would give us a big chunk of ice. And we would run home and give it to mother, because it was kind of wasteful for us to eat it. We would take a piece of waxed paper from the bread and wrap up the ice in that, and that was better than any popsicle.    Mr. Aumack: And that was just ice, wow!    Mrs. Walling: Yes, and we didn’t worry about dirt or anything. You didn’t wash it off, you just ate it right off the ice truck. He would have the ice tongs, and he would bring in the ice to the house and put it in your icebox.    Mr. Aumack: Was that free?    Mrs. Walling: No, you paid by the pound. I don’t remember how much it was per pound.    Mr. Aumack: Did he come around every week?    Mrs. Walling: Oh, every day, because that would melt, especially in the summer. We had a great time when we really got a radio, because you had your stories. You had "The Thin Man" and "The Lone Ranger," and you sat there and you didn’t move. We had a parrot, and sometimes Polly would get to squawking, just when it was the good part of the story. So we would cover her up so we could hear the stories. But that was fascinating, because you imagined all these people and all these adventures.    Mr. Aumack: Did you have a favorite story?    Mrs. Walling: All of them.    Mr. Aumack: Who did you listen to, besides "The Lone Ranger"?    Mrs. Walling: "The Thin Man," and there was another one "Saturday Night." We didn’t have a television for a long time, but my girlfriend across the street had one. And we would get our baths and everything on Saturday night, and we would run over and see the Sinatra show, and then run back home again.    Mr. Aumack: Did you get a television in the house ever?    Mrs. Walling: Yes, they were black-and-white back in those days. I forget the year we got one, but it wasn’t when they first came out. It was quite awhile. But the radio was fascinating! And also in those days, Betty and I had a doll and a doll carriage. At Christmas time, the first thing you would look at was the dolls, because mother would sometimes dress them up. And that was one of our biggest gifts, because we only had a couple of dolls. We still have our baby dolls, and I still have my doll carriage. Today, everyone has lots of toys. We didn’t have a lot of stuff, but we had everything we ever needed. And you made up things. We didn’t have a pool, but my father would bring a fish box home, and it would hold the water. You would fill it with water, and we would play in that all day long.    Mr. Aumack: How big was it?    Mrs. Walling: Oh, just a small one. Maybe from where you are across the table to here, not very big. But it was big enough for Betty and me to sit in and play.    Mr. Aumack: Tell me about Shirley Temple.    Mrs. Walling: I still have a Shirley Temple doll. She wasn’t brand new, but it was given to me one time. I think that was when my father was working for the W.P.A. There were times, like around holidays, and I never knew how it got there, but sometimes there would be a basket of something on the front porch. It would be around the holidays, and it would be food. But I remember somebody gave me this Shirley Temple doll.    Mr. Aumack: Was it paper?    Mrs. Walling: No, it was a doll with hair. Those days, the dolls had hair. And we used to have paper dolls, and we had a paper doll of Princess Margaret, and Princess Elizabeth, who is now the queen. You would cut them out of magazines, and you would play with paper dolls. And we played with baby dolls and doll carriages for years! You don’t even have little children today playing with doll carriages. They are all into Barbie, and kind of grown-up toys. And we had those dolls for years, I still have them.    Mr. Aumack: Tell us about the chickens.    Mrs. Walling: When we moved over to Washington…in fact when we were over on Broadway, we had a big garden in the back yard. In fact, I have an arrowhead that was found in that area when my father was turning over the land. Because Indians were in that area. But when we moved over on Washington Street, we had ducks and chickens. We used them for eggs, and we used them for food. Then later on, you weren’t allowed to have them in the town.    Mr. Aumack: You weren’t allowed to have chickens in the town?    Mrs. Walling: I don’t know if that’s when we stopped having them, but today you couldn’t have them.    Mr. Aumack: Why did you stop having the chickens?    Mrs. Walling: It was against the law. As a residential area began to build up, then they made different laws, that you weren’t allowed to have certain things. And there was one year, when we had one of the hurricanes. The water was coming up underneath the chicken houses, so my father had to go get them. At that time, he had raincoat on with these buckles. And it got caught in the wiring, and he fell. So he actually had difficulty in his own back yard. With all the years being on the water, he had difficulty in his own back yard.    Mr. Aumack: So you had the chickens just for the family, to provide food?    Mrs. Walling: Yes.    Mr. Aumack: He didn’t sell the eggs or anything?    Mrs. Walling: I don’t think so. We ate them all.    Mr. Aumack: And you ate the chickens as well?    Mrs. Walling: Yes.    Mr. Aumack: You didn’t have any roosters?    Mrs. Walling: Yes, we did, and I remember sometimes I used to have one as a pet. And I remember the time we finally did kill the rooster. I don’t think that I ate him. One time we went to Perth Amboy for chicks, and they all turned out to be Rhode Island Red, and they were all roosters. We would go to Perth Amboy on the bus, and you would be able to buy the small chicks in the five-and-ten. And then we would bring them back on the bus. Sometimes we would keep them in a box in the kitchen for awhile, until they got a little bit bigger, because it was warmer for them. I mean that is like having real pets in the house! Of course, we did have some neighbors where the chickens did kind of wander in and out of the house. And you could actually watch when they would kill the chicken. In those days, they didn’t think much of it when they killed it, slit its throat, hanged it, and took its feathers off. But today, I don’t think that would be so great.    Mr. Aumack: When you would buy a chick from the five-and-ten, how much did it cost?    Mrs. Walling: Ten cents each.    Mr. Aumack: Do you recall any chickens that had grown up to a point where your father would say it was time to kill it?    Mrs. Walling: Oh yes. I remember one of my pet ones was a rooster, and I just couldn’t eat him.    Mr. Aumack: But he still served it as dinner?    Mrs. Walling: Yes, he was served.    Mr. Aumack: Who ate it?    Mrs. Erickson: Oh, I did.    Mrs. Walling: Well, she didn’t get quite as attached to those things as I did.    Mr. Aumack: So you really were attached to a lot of the animals.    Mrs. Walling: Yes. I had pigeons, and I even had a few baby squabs at a time. I would get box turtles from the meadows and keep them for awhile. We always had cats, and we always had at least one hound dog and maybe another dog. Not that you would buy these, they were just strays that would come around and attach themselves, and we would keep them.    Mr. Aumack: Oh, you didn’t buy it. It was a stray that you would take in?    Mrs. Walling: Yes, except the hound dog. Sometimes my father would get a hound puppy from somebody.    Mr. Aumack: Talk about seeing the Shirley Temple movies. Which movie theater did you go to?    Mrs. Walling: Keyport had a little theater, and I believe it was like a quarter to get in the movies. One of our friends, Betty’s music teacher, originally used to play the piano in the movie theatre. I don’t remember that time  it was for silent films. But at that time, and I do remember even when I was in high school, the upstairs balcony was for Black people. And I couldn’t imagine why they always had the best place, because it was upstairs. But at that time, they were not allowed to sit downstairs. And they were people that you were going to school with, but they weren’t allowed to sit downstairs. But you didn’t really understand much about it, you just sort of accepted it. Being small, I got in the movie for a kid’s price for quite a few years beyond my time. (laughter)    Mr. Aumack: So after you turned twelve, you could still pay the dime, right?    Mrs. Walling: I guess it was like that, but I’m not sure if it was a dime or a quarter.    Mr. Aumack: You talked about Black people being in the balcony section. So the movie theaters, in the early 1940s, were segregated?    Mrs. Walling: Yes.    Mr. Aumack: Now were the schools segregated?    Mrs. Walling: No.    Mr. Aumack: Oh, that’s interesting.    Mrs. Walling: But we did have sort of like a certain area of town where the majority of the Black people lived. But the school itself, we were all in class together.    Mr. Aumack: Were there any stores that they weren’t allowed to go into?    Mrs. Walling: I don’t recall that. Today I am a teacher, and when I read about those things, I really can’t remember that. I can’t even remember it on the bus or anything. I don’t think it was in effect when I was riding the bus back and forth to Perth Amboy.    Mr. Aumack: Do you remember seeing any Black people on the bus with you to Perth Amboy?    Mrs. Walling: Yes.    Mr. Aumack: So you don’t remember where they sat?    Mrs. Walling: I think they could sit anyplace.    Mr. Aumack: So from your knowledge, the only place that you could say was really segregated in Keyport, was in the movie theatre.    Mrs. Walling: Yes, that’s the only place that I recall.    Mr. Aumack: Talk to me about your Victory Garden a little bit.    Mrs. Walling: I guess my father would have just about everything in there. You kind of took it for granted, you know. A lot of people had gardens. And you would can all the food.    Mr. Aumack: Now where did that all go?    Mrs. Walling: To us for food. Mother would can the food, and then that would be for the winter.    Mr. Aumack: What kind of foods did you have?    Mrs. Walling: Tomatoes, peaches, and some jelly. And if somebody gave you a basket of peaches, you would can those. Or if somebody gave you grapes, you would can those for jelly.        Elizabeth Walling, 1948    Mr. Aumack: Did you make strawberry jelly?    Mrs. Walling: No. We had the wild strawberries at the school, but I don’t remember any big strawberries like you have today.    Mr. Aumack: Now you graduated from high school in 1948?    Mrs. Walling: Yes. After Betty left the library, I went there. And after I graduated, I stayed at the library for another year, because I couldn’t get working papers. You couldn’t get working papers until you were seventeen. And I just couldn’t seem to find a job. And one of Betty’s friends called and told me the First Bank & Trust in Perth Amboy was hiring, and wondered if I was interested. And at that time, you went by bus, you wore a hat, and you wore white gloves. I was hired on the spot, and I worked there for eight and a half years. I worked in two different departments, in the transit department and in the note department. While in the note department, I was told that I was going to train a young fellow to be my boss. You see in those days, a female could not hold a higher position. And that was the best thing that ever happened, because I left the bank, but I didn’t leave at that spot. I called the college, which was Newark State at that time. It was the first year they were in Union, so I was partly at Newark State in Newark, and partly at the new campus in Union. And I started there as a freshman, and I went for four years to become a teacher. And I went back to the bank every summer.    Mr. Aumack: What job did you have, to teach this gentleman?    Mrs. Walling: I would do the window, and the window was called when you took care of a customer. I was in the loan department, and the loan application would have already been filled out by an officer of the bank. But you would have to process it, and then give them a check. If there was collateral, it would have to be recorded, photographed, and stored. So mostly what I was to train him to do was that type of thing. He was not going to use the machine that I was using, the bookkeeping machine. He was going to be more at the window, and more in charge of the department.    Mr. Aumack: Were you seventeen or eighteen when you trained him?    Mrs. Walling: I got the job probably just before I was eighteen, and I worked there eight and a half years. So it was after that eight and a half years that I was training him.    Mr. Aumack: So you trained him when you were twenty-something?    Mrs. Walling: Yes.    Mr. Aumack: Was he older than you?    Mrs. Walling: I don’t recall if he was older than I was. If he was, he wouldn’t have been very much older, or only a couple of years if he was younger.    Mr. Aumack: Was he nice to you?    Mrs. Walling: Yes, it wasn’t his problem.    Mr. Aumack: So you weren’t mistreated or anything by him?    Mrs. Walling: No. He was told what he had to do, also.    Mr. Aumack: Where did you start teaching?    Mrs. Walling: Because Betty and I went to the two-room schoolhouse on Washington Street, I always wanted to teach in a little schoolhouse…even a one-room schoolhouse with all the grades together. My first job was in a four-room schoolhouse on Second Street in Keyport, and I taught kindergarten my first year. I was considered a floater, I guess you would call it. If the influx was to first grade, there would be two first grade teachers, and I would do first grade. If the next year there were more kindergarten children, there would be two kindergarten classes, and I would do kindergarten. And one year I had a split first grade and kindergarten.    Mr. Aumack: What was the largest size class you taught?    Mrs. Walling: Twenty-seven.    Mr. Aumack: What was the smallest?    Mrs. Walling: Probably sixteen. I taught in that little schoolhouse for twenty years. It was great because it had originally been a two-room schoolhouse, so there were brick walls between the front two rooms. The front two rooms were added later. And it was great because you saw the children before you got them sometimes, and you saw them several years after you had them. There were four teachers, and there were four grades. That’s when you taught everything, you didn’t have "specials." You taught art, music, and had them for recess. The only thing you didn’t have them for was lunch. And at one time they had an hour for lunch, because it was a local school. They all went home for lunch, and you didn’t have both parents working. Then when more parents started working and there was no place to put the children, they went to a half-hour lunch, and they stayed at school. Or they could still go home.    Mr. Aumack: Can you describe any big changes in the school system?    Mrs. Walling: There really isn’t a lot of "May I," "Thank you," or "Please" today. There are so many little things gone that we used to take for granted. And you really need to teach those things.    Mr. Aumack: What do you think needs to be taught nowadays?    Mrs. Walling: Well you need to teach "Please," "Thank you," and "May I." It didn’t seem like we had as much difficulty with reading years ago. I always had a few children who had difficulty reading, but today it seems like we have more children experiencing difficulty. I don’t think we have as many people or parents reading to children, or even having newspapers in the house. That was your biggest thing. You had the radio, but you didn’t have the television. And a lot of your information came from newspapers and magazines, and different things.    Mr. Aumack: Do you think one of the reasons children find it harder to learn to read is the lack of parents talking and reading to their kids?     Mrs. Walling: It could be, but then we also have a lot more to do now. Everybody has a car, so you have a lot of other activities. There are a lot of children going to many different things that weren’t available years ago. There are all kinds of sports now: Pop Warner, cheerleading, gymnastics, karate, and piano lessons, etc. There is a lot more money available, and there are a lot more things out there. And education is not "the" thing, in many cases.    Mr. Aumack: What do you think it is?    Mrs. Walling: Well, I have even had people say they didn’t do their homework because they had football practice. Now this is Pop Warner, you know. And I would tell them that they now had two sets of homework to do tonight. But the priority at times is that they couldn’t do homework because they had to go somewhere. And you don’t get the backing quite as much, like Mom asking them if their homework is done.    Mr. Aumack: Talk a bit more about family values. Do you have the feeling that maybe they have declined?    Mrs. Walling: I don’t know. But even going back, we never knew we didn’t have things. It seemed like all our friends were sort of in the same situation. We never wanted or needed anything. It seemed everything was provided. Today it seems like there are a lot of "wants" out there. And not being satisfied with some of the things that you have. Children have so many toys, and when they go to the store, they want another one, and another one. And they usually get it.    Mr. Aumack: Can you discuss the change in the community of Keyport from the time that you lived there until now?    Mrs. Walling: We had one big schoolhouse, where the current 7 Eleven and a lot of houses are now. It took that whole block. We had a high school, which was several blocks away. That high school is still there. We had the two little schoolhouses. One actually wasn’t used for awhile, because of the decline in the number of neighborhood children, and it wasn’t needed any more. So they went to the big school. The old grammar school was torn down years ago, when they built the new central school. The old grammar school had three floors. To get from one end of the building to the other, you walked through classrooms. You had to walk through very quietly so you didn’t disturb anybody, but you literally walked through classrooms as you changed from place to place.    Mr. Aumack: Is there anything that you would like to add about the school system and your experience with the children?    Mrs. Walling: Oh, I just love it. One part of my school system that has changed: in 1980 I met a person in her eighties who taught me the Orton-Gilligham method of teaching reading. It is considered a multi-sensory method of reading. She taught me more in the few years that I knew here than anybody has ever taught me. And today I find that when using that, you can pretty much get every child to read, maybe not at a very high level, but you can get them reading. Today they will talk about children who are visual or auditory. The Orton-Gilligham method is multi-sensory, and you teach by using your body. It’s like if you see the letter ‘A’…you will say ‘A’, so you are hearing the ‘A’. You will also draw the ‘A’ in the air, so you are putting it in different parts of your body. It’s kinesthetic, auditory, and it’s visual. And a child who has difficulty in one of those areas, you are bound to meet it by using this method. The child who is bright even gets a lot more.    Mr. Aumack: So you still use this method today?    Mrs. Walling: When I was with Mrs. Reed, the woman who taught me, she had had two books printed back in the 1970s. We got her to get it published by Educators Publishers, in Massachusetts. But the one requirement was that we have the Teachers Manuals completely done over. And I worked with another first grade teacher in doing those over. And when Mrs. Reed left to move down south in Maryland with her daughter, she left me all her material. So in the past couple of years, I have made the phonics books, and I have had them printed. They are called "Phonics for Thought."    Mr. Aumack: What would you like to say to the younger generation, of Keyport or perhaps Monmouth County? Do you have any advice for them?    Mrs. Walling: Look around you, and be grateful for the things you have. Don’t be looking for them always some place else. I think even some of our religious values have changed a lot. It seems like a lot more kids were going to Sunday School, or being involved in a lot of different things years ago. Just be aware of what’s around you, and be grateful for the good that you already have.    Mr. Aumack: I think that’s a great place to stop. Thank you very much.    
MonmouthCounty;Edythe Kaufman;1924;1999;Edythe Kaufman, 1924, 1999        Remembering The 20th Century: An Oral History of Monmouth County      Edythe Kaufman  Date of Interview:  December 16, 1999  Name of Interviewer:  Flora Higgins  Premises of Interview:  Ms. Kaufman's home, Aberdeen, NJ  Birth date of subject:  April 26, 1924      Ms. Higgins:  Could tell me a little bit about your family?  How did you come to be a New Jersey person?  Where did your parents came from? And your husband's people?    Ms. Kaufman: Well, both my parents were born right in New York City.  My grandmother came over from Austria in the 1870s, my mother and dad were born here. We lived in New York City for quite a while, partially Manhattan and partially the Bronx.  Then, we visited a friend out here who is originally from New Bedford, Massachusetts and who had moved down to the Levitt development in Strathmore.  We were very impressed by what was offered at the time, and we subsequently moved down there  we were very happy there. And so that's the way we started our New Jersey venture. It was about thirty odd years ago.    Ms. Higgins: Were you active in politics in Matawan-Aberdeen?    Ms. Kaufman: I wasn't, but my husband was. Moving to a small town from New York City, he got very interested in local things: how the population exploded, and so on. He was very interested in doing things on a volunteer basis, most of the time.    Ms. Higgins: What was his profession?    Edward Kaufman    Ms. Kaufman: He was a lawyer, and eventually he opened a law office in the Township, and luckily so, because he was the Mayor some years later.  He was able to get to an awful lot of things that were happening in town, because it was a part time position, it wasn't a full time position. My husband and I and our two daughters had moved to Strathmore.  Strathmore is a section of Matawan Township in Northern Monmouth County and in August of 1963 we decided to come down from New York City. Mr. Kaufman was a Manhattan native and a graduate of St. Johns University and Law School. He had been admitted to both the New York and the New Jersey Bar. I was a graduate of Hunter College with a Bachelors Degree in Music and a Masters Degree in Early Childhood Education. The Matawan Aberdeen School District, where I taught kindergarten for twenty-two years, employed me. At the time of our move to Strathmore, the population of Matawan Township was about 5,000 residents and with a building of 2,000 new homes, one of which we occupied, there was a large increase in population. Lots of stores were being built, new business were coming in, and lots of gas stations also. Mr. Kaufman became interested in volunteering on the Zoning Board of Adjustment at that time. He became a member in 1964 and in 1966 was appointed chairman. Mr. Kaufman believed that the Zoning Board of Adjustment was one of the most important agencies in Matawan Township, because he felt that the zoning ordinance should be interpreted strictly, and variances issued only for good and valid reasons. He believed that this would help to preserve the desirable residential quality of the community. Mr. Kaufman eventually became a Member of the Township Council, later, and after several years of serving on the council was elected Mayor of Matawan Township. He served from 1976 to 1979 in this capacity. During the time Mr. Kaufman served as Mayor, which was a part time position, he devoted a great deal of his time to Township problems and solutions. There were many telephone calls to our house sometimes about snowy streets not being cleared fast enough, sometimes property damage to a neighbor's house, basically all the myriad problems one would encounter in a Township.  Mr. Kaufman had rented an office on Route 34 for his own business, so he was in the Township most of the time. Any fire emergency calls answered by our excellent fire department always saw Mayor Kaufman there as well. He was present at any Township emergency he could get to, so much so, that the workers in the various Township departments awarded him an honorary hard hat for his great interest and concern  however, there was something very strange about this area we lived in. There were two Matawans: Matawan Borough and Matawan Township, with two separate governing councils, two separate identities, but only one name of Matawan appeared on the map of New Jersey. Matawan Borough, the smaller community, was 2.5 square miles with approximately 8,000 residents, and the larger Matawan Township was 5.4 square miles and over 19,000 in population, but it was not even listed on the map.  Matawan Township is composed of several small sections namely Cliffwood, Cliffwood Beach, Strathmore, Freneau, all Matawan Township, yet no designation on the map or even in the Almanac as such. As a result of there being two Matawans, federal and state funds that were designated for Matawan Township had often been mistakenly sent to Matawan Borough. Mayor Kaufman started to check into this and discovered that a public works road project allocated to Matawan Borough was really slated for Matawan Township. When Mayor Kaufman called the Washington Bureau that handled this, the officials were very, very confused about the situation. They did not, at that time, have a clear distinction as to what was Matawan Borough and what was Matawan Township, since only one name of Matawan appeared on the map.  As a result, it was discovered that public works money in the amount of $329,000  would have been sent to the Borough, had there been no intervention by Mayor Kaufman.  Besides this mistake, it was discovered that many census errors had occurred.  Unemployment statistics were inaccurate and it had become impossible to use income tax data for social services allocations to people who really needed help. There were the instances in which telephone calls for fire, police, and the first aid squad had been rerouted to the incorrect town. The Department of Labor Statistics in Washington identified seventy-three Matawan Township businesses as being in Matawan Borough. Also many Township's gross receipt tax credits were incorrect. These difficulties were all examined by the Township's manager and my husband over a period of time. Eventually, due to the many problems, many residents of our community thought it was time to do away with the confusion of two places named Matawan and that a name change might be in order. To investigate this possibility, a committee of twenty members was formed, headed by Lieutenant John B. McGinty of the Matawan Township Police Force. This committee spent two years researching and investigating the possibility of a name change. Many public meetings were held for discussion. No high-pressure tactics were involved. People were supplied with the information they needed about the reasons for a name change and made up their own minds. The committee also began searching for a new, appropriate name for the Township, and eventually it was decided to honor the first settlers who came to the area in 1685. At that time, a group of 165 Scottish Presbyterians accompanied by their minister set sail from Aberdeen, Scotland to seek religious freedom in the new world  somewhat akin to the pilgrims who made the journey sixty years before. Many of these Scottish people had been put in prisons for their religious beliefs. They boarded a small ship called the Henry and Francis and endured a terrible, stormy crossing of the Atlantic. Many passengers were in ill health, and on this crossing a violent fever swept the small ship and took sixty lives. Fortunately, however, the rest of the group survived, came to a new area in what was to be Monmouth County, named it New Aberdeen, and settled here. So in honor of the early settlers, it was decided to change the name of Matawan Township to Aberdeen Township. Petitions were circulated to collect the necessary number of signatures for a vote on the name change. That done, a referendum was held on November 8, 1977, and a majority of the people of Matawan Township voted affirmatively to change the name to Aberdeen Township and thus avoid confusion with Matawan Borough. After the successful vote, there was a growing desire to unite all the small sections of Aberdeen under one zip code. At that time, Aberdeen was served by three post offices and two zip codes. In gaining their own zip code, people of Aberdeen felt that this guaranteed the use of the name Aberdeen Township in the mailing address, and help establish its identity. Despite the fact that the name change had been voted in, the post office decided to ignore that fact and instructed all residents to continue using the name Matawan Township in addressing their mail, and to ignore the name Aberdeen. In a similar fashion, New Jersey Bell customers were surveyed asking whether they would like their directory address listed as Aberdeen, but several Aberdeen residents stated that telephone representatives said that the Aberdeen listing would be unrecognizable and suggested they keep the one they had.  However, there was definitely a need for a zip code change. One incident I can remember concerned a family living at Balmoral Court in the former Matawan Township with the exact same zip code as a Balmoral Court residence in Old Bridge, the community right next door to Matawan. Because of these same zip codes, mail between these two homes often got mixed up.  Other areas in Old Bridge as well carried the same zip code as Matawan did. More important, a resident of the Cliffwood section (really Aberdeen) told the Congressional Representative of our District that her ten year old son almost died following an accident due to the confusion over where to send an ambulance.  "I almost lost my son because of these various post office addresses," she said. "It is time Aberdeen had its own zip code." Cliffwood, a section of Aberdeen Township, had a zip code of 07721. Cliffwood Beach, another section, was 07735, as well as a part of Keyport, a neighboring town, which  also had 07735 as a zip code.  All this confusion prompted Mayor Kaufman, Lieutenant McGinty, and others of his committee to write to the Assistant Postmaster General for Government Operations and then to the Postmaster General himself, that consideration be given to arrange for a new zip code for all of Aberdeen Township. Receiving no replies whatsoever, they decided eventually that a trip to the United States Postal Service Bureau in Washington should be made. At their own expense, a group of residents, Mayor Kaufman, and his family, and some Township officials rented a bus for the trip. Local papers as well as WNBC-TV recorded the group's early morning departure. At this time The Daily Register, a Red Bank newspaper, wrote an editorial dated July 12, 1978 concerning the problem.  It stated:     "Voters of what was formally Matawan Township last fall authorized a name change to Aberdeen Township, in the hope that their municipality would have a clear identity. Part of the reasoning that went with the decision was that Matawan Township was being confused with the Borough of Matawan by governmental agencies, and just about everyone who did not have close ties with the Township. A prime concern to Township officials was the assumption that the Township could lose out on government grants or government services because bureaucrats could not or would not make a distinction between the Township and the Borough.  In addition, the name change was intended to end the divisions within the Township that had some people thinking that sections such as Cliffwood Beach and the Strathmore development were actually individual municipalities. Aberdeen's Mayor, Edward E. Kaufman, is one of the Township residents who wanted to bring the entire Township together and make it easily recognizable. He believes that that goal cannot be achieved as long as mail for Township residents is delivered in three different post offices each with its own zip code. And the United States Postal Service has been requested to give Aberdeen its own zip code, but urgent pleas have fallen on deaf ears at the post office that served the Township and The Post Office in Washington. Aberdeen should not be faulted and neither should its Mayor for striving to firmly establish the Township's identity. It's our opinion that a separate zip code for the Township is not only desirable but is necessary if the postal service is to effectively discharge its duties. The postal service has developed an arrogance which makes dealing with it most difficult. We hope Aberdeen wins its battle because it also would be a victory for the public at large. Mayor Kaufman deserves praise for his efforts thus far, and we trust he will continue with his campaign until Aberdeen's intelligent and understandable plea is heeded."     Despite everything that was tried to obtain a zip code for Aberdeen Township, the results were unsuccessful. Mayor Kaufman decided that when he did not receive any satisfaction from the US Postal Service in Washington, he would write to President Jimmy Carter asking him to intervene with the postal authorities. Mr. Kaufman wrote, "This letterhead contains our address as we would like it, but the postal service has informed us that it would not deliver mail so addressed." Mayor Kaufman had described how Aberdeen had been losing federal and state funds that were misdirected when the authorities of various bureaus were unable to determine what municipality was rightfully entitled to them. Mayor Kaufman said, "We have run up against the proverbial stone wall in our dealing with the postal authorities, and I look to you as our last resort in our efforts to acquire the identity we desperately seek." He went on to explain the reasons and desires to have one zip code unifying all sections of Aberdeen. Mayor Kaufman never received a reply from the President. Eventually, a letter was sent to Mayor Kaufman from a John Lintner, a spokesman for the Postmaster General stating that if the Township's officials were able to produce evidence that an overwhelming majority of the effected customers approved a change they might look into it.  Mr. Lintner completely ignored the fact that the name change had been voted for. It was not up to him to decide whether residents did really vote this in, they had. It was a legitimate change voted on November 8, 1977 for the new name of Aberdeen Township. His idea to poll residents of the town was irrelevant. Mayor Kaufman sent a copy of Mr. Lintner's letter to President Carter stating, "If the postal service had their way and if their philosophy was adopted in other areas of government, you, Mr. President may not have been permitted to take office in January following your election.  Instead, the Democratic Party would have been forced to conduct a house to house survey to ascertain whether or not an overwhelming majority of our citizens really supported your election. This of course would make a mockery of one of our basic principles that the voice of the people is heard via the electoral process."  Aberdeen Township wasn't successful in getting a zip code for our Township, but we still know that Aberdeen is a strong reality in Monmouth County. It has its own exit on the Garden State Parkway. It has been growing steadily so much so that its offices and agencies have outgrown the tiny building and rental trailer they were originally housed in. Soon after the name change, Aberdeen got a beautiful red brick Town Hall large enough to house all the departments, conduct town meetings in a beautiful council room, and also to accommodate our top notch Aberdeen Police Department. Aberdeen is a thriving community filled with wonderful residents. I'm proud to have lived there with my family for thirty years. I'm especially proud of my husband, Edward Kaufman, who loved the town, was anxious to see it thrive, and did his best for Aberdeen Township.     Ms. Higgins: Well, thank you very much. I remember well when that struggle was going on.  Don't Aberdeen and Matawan have the same zip code now?    Ms. Kaufman:  They do. We were not successful. You know what they could've done?  Cliffwood has its own zip code. They could've taken that and made that our zip code.  It's not as if they have to pull numbers out of the air.    Ms. Higgins:  In fact, isn't it now a hyphenated community: Matawan - Aberdeen?    Ms. Kaufman:  Well, that's because of the fact that we're a regional school district, so the names of both towns are represented.         Ms. Higgins:  Was your husband the mayor of Matawan Township?     Ms. Kaufman:  Yes, not Matawan Borough.     Ms. Higgins:  How did the Board of Election organize voting districts?    Ms. Kaufman:  Completely separate. There were two absolute entities.  They had their one to ten districts and we had ours. Everything was different  their government was different, they had their own council, their own departments, their own town meeting hall which was right in the heart of the borough of Matawan.        Ms. Higgins:  Correct me if I'm wrong, but the Matawan -Aberdeen Joint Free Public Library is the only one with joint political structure in the state.    Ms. Kaufman:  Yes, and they're not members of the Monmouth County system as far as I know.     Ms. Higgins:  Was the Victorian atmosphere in Matawan still there?    Ms. Kaufman:  Yes, but our development was new.  The residents resented us for a awhile.  I can't blame them--- 200 new houses?  Where are all these new people coming from?  Most, I think, came from New York, but many came from other areas in New Jersey as well.      Ms. Higgins:  Was it a Levitt's construction?     Ms. Kaufman: Yes, and guess what?  They are still standing  they are still going strong, and they were well built.    Ms. Higgins:   I have many friends there, and I've been to many parties there, and we always admired the Strathmore development.      Ms. Kaufman: At the time, they were giving you a lot more than other communities for a decent price: wall ovens, central air conditioning, some landscaping, etc.     Ms. Higgins:  What jobs did people of the borough have?  Were they farmers, tradesman, or something else?    Ms. Kaufman:  They were tradesman basically. It's a small community.  That's where the town stores were, so we always went into Matawan Borough to shop.  You know, the supermarket, drugstores, all that was in there. The township didn't have anything like that.  But of course, as the community got larger and we had more area, some of the malls were built.    Ms. Higgins:  Where did you shop for groceries?    Ms. Kaufman:  Well, there was a Shoprite on Route 36.  There was A&P in Cliffwood.  I shopped mostly in Matawan Borough.  They had a Foodtown there.  It closed eventually and became a liquor store.  Of course later on, a Grand Union came into Aberdeen, but that was much later in our area.      Ms. Higgins:  Did you come here after the big school explosion, or were you a part of it? When did you come to Matawan -Aberdeen?    Ms. Kaufman: 1963.    Ms. Higgins:  Did they have split sessions kindergarten?      Ms. Kaufman:  No, they always had two regular sessions of kindergarten, but my daughters were subject to split sessions in the elementary grades.  They would either have to come in very early or come home late by bus.    Ms. Higgins:  The school explosion seemed to take everybody by surprise. When you were teaching kindergarten, had the New Jersey Department of Education decided between a more preparatory style of kindergarten and a kindergarten that came down more emphatically on learning phonetics and basics and reading? What's your approach to that?    Ms. Kaufman:  It's very interesting that you said that because I went through that whole cycle. When we came down it was a nice, comprehensive curriculum--some science, social studies, music, some elementary math -- different things and playtime.  And there was an emphasis of course of alphabet learning.  But there was no pressure put on to read. Some of the children came in being able to read, and so we did have grouping in kindergarten.  And there were lots of other things: we had a record center  children could use with a whole battery of special records - stories and music.  And then we had our slated schedules for doing certain areas of curriculum.  And then all of a sudden came the feeling that children should be reading in kindergarten.  That was okay for the advanced children.  Yes, there were always some children who could read, but some of them just knew their sounds or only the alphabet, but weren't ready to read as yet.  We did teach phonics and there was more pressure on that.  Unfortunately, the other things that I thought were very important like science, fell away as had other parts of the curriculum in some respects.  We did not have too much time as our sessions were only two and a half hours.  I had developed a Marine Curriculum for kindergarten which we had a lot of fun with, but the emphasis was on phonics and reading.                Ms. Higgins:  How many children approximately were there in a class?    Ms. Kaufman:  About twenty-five.    Ms. Higgins:  Did you have an assistant?    Ms. Kaufman:  No.    Ms. Higgins:  You handled twenty-five five year olds?    Ms. Kaufman:  Yes.    Ms. Higgins:  That's a lot of organization.    Ms. Kaufman:  We even had two classes in one room when I first started. We had fourteen kindergartens, which went down to four eventually.    Ms. Higgins:  Have you seen a diminuation of music as a curriculum necessity in our community?    Ms. Kaufman:  Well, I'm glad to say that Matawan - Aberdeen had a couple on the School Board who thought that the Arts were important.  Some districts did away with the Arts.      Ms. Higgins:  Do you remember the names of the Board members?    Ms. Kaufman:  Well, Marilyn Brenner was one of them. I remember that she was very strong.  I don't remember the others  I knew her best.  They did keep it going.  First, they thought they might take music out of the Junior High, but they didn't. The High School had a very good band for years, and a lot of good vocal music concerts.  I remember singing the Hallelujah Chorus every Christmas.  Also, I'm very proud of the fact that my daughter, a graduate of Rutgers University, has taught music at the Lloyd Road School for quite a few years now.          Ms. Higgins:  What were some hot spots in town you could go when you wanted to go out to dinner or have a good time in the evening?    Ms. Kaufman:  Well, a good restaurant that's still there is Jerry Byers.  They have very good food, French cuisine type. About going out -- my husband and I had a thirty-year subscription to the New Jersey Symphony Orchestra. That's what we liked.    Ms. Higgins:  We've been going for years. It's been a joy to see that develop the way it has.    Ms. Kaufman:  It has some very good conductors. My husband and I were also opera lovers.  So we always went to New York, first at the New York City Opera, and then we went to the Metropolitan Opera some years later, but that was his love.  It's funny, because he really didn't know anything technical about music, and in fact, when we'd sit at a concert, he'd read something in the program notes, and he'd say,  "Tell me what is--," then shortly after, "Oh, never mind, don't bother."  He just enjoyed listening.  He really loved the opera.    Ms. Higgins:  Your undergraduate degree is music.    Ms. Kaufman:  Yes, and I used to sing classically.     Ms. Higgins:  Did you?    Ms. Kaufman:  Yes.  I sang leading soprano roles at the Amato Opera Company in New York.  I've sung at the Chautauqua Art Colony in New York.  I don't know if you know about this.  It's a wonderful place.      Ms. Higgins:  Yes, I do.     Ms. Kaufman:  I was in the opera company up there for two summers.  It was wonderful and I'm still going up there as a visitor.    Ms. Higgins:  Do you sing now? There are so many groups.    Ms. Kaufman: I sang with the Monmouth Civic Chorus for several years.  I used to do church work and temple work as a soloist.  I was a soloist at the Christian Science Church in Keyport for a time.  I enjoyed singing at religious services very much.  But my main love was teaching.  I loved teaching kindergarten tremendously.  I know teachers would say, "How can you teach that grade level?  You need such patience.  You have to repeat yourself so many times."  I didn't mind, -- I loved it.  I loved that age group.      Ms. Higgins:   So fresh and eager.      Ms. Kaufman:  Yes, it was wonderful.  I loved the progress about it.  Every grade has progress, but this was so particularly noticeable in kindergarten because the mothers would bring their children in and hate to part from them, and a lot of them would cry.  Early on in the term, usually September, I would have the children draw a picture of their family.  A lot of pictures would be drawn showing circles and stick figures and a small amount of detail.  Then in June I'd have them do the same.  They wouldn't have their same first drawing.  Then I would send both of these pictures home, and the progress was always amazing.  The second drawings had dimension.  They had clothing, face details, hair, lots of color, etc., and I just loved that so much.  It showed growth and progress.  Mothers and dads loved it too.         Ms. Higgins:  Do you remember what you were doing when you heard that John Kennedy had been shot?    Ms. Kaufman:  I was shopping in a store over in Keyport, in a type of store like Bradlees.  I remember walking around buying merchandise and all of a sudden this loud speaker announcement came on.  Oh, that was so terrible.  I thought that he was a wonderful president.      Ms. Higgins:  As you look at the school systems, we now have this outbreak of violence in the schools, do you have any comments that you would like to share for posterity about these changes in the culture?      Ms. Kaufman:  Well, I remember when I first started teaching, everyone was interested mainly in developing self-esteem.  Self-esteem was very, very important  it is important, but to me, a sense of responsibility is most important.  When I taught children, they had to be responsible -- if you've messed this up, even in a simple way, or walked away from something you didn't finish or clean up, you go back and fix it.  It's your responsibility.  Now children could develop a kind of responsibility they could understand and work with.  If someone hit somebody, whatever it was, we talked it out.  I was very big on a sense of responsibility at an early age.  I guess I was taught that way myself.          Ms. Higgins:  Keeping track of twenty-five of them is wonderful.     Ms. Kaufman:  Well, a lot of them were very nice, and they always had something interesting to do.  We had many, many activity centers.  We also tried to keep current with some current events.  During the space shuttle era, we got ourselves a large box that a washing machine had been packed in.  I dragged that into school  we painted it red, white, and blue, with USA on it.  That was our space shuttle and the children took turns being astronauts.  They loved it.  From time to time we had lots of conferences with parents so that they always know how their child was doing at school.  Occasionally, even now, I meet parents of my former students, and they are very complimentary about my teaching.  It's so nice to hear that.      Ms. Higgins:  What were some of the books that the children liked?    Ms. Kaufman:  Goodnight Moon and Corduroy were favorites.    Ms. Higgins:  Were you reading Dr. Seuss' books to the children then?    Ms. Kaufman:  Oh yes. Oh, how could I forget him!     Ms. Higgins:  Can you tell us something about your family's cultural traditions?      Ms. Kaufman: Well, we celebrated Jewish holidays like Passover and Hanukah with  various Jewish families, but we also have Christian relatives who we celebrated Christmas with -- Easter too.  We share with all parts of our family.      Ms. Higgins:  Would you like to make any comments about your husband's interest and involvement with the governing body, dealing with politics in Monmouth County?  Did he want to do any other kind of political service?    Ms. Kaufman:  No, there was a Senator, Richard Van Wagner, a lovely man, and he started out small.  Then he wanted to keep going  he did.  He became one of our senators.  My husband didn't want to go any further.  He was happy.  He always said he was excited because this was a small town.  We came from a big city -- that's all we knew.  It was so nice therefore, to be able to do something and to meet the people in the diner or at meetings.  Mr. Kaufman was happy.  To be Mayor of Aberdeen was an honor for him, and he had no desire to run for any other office at all.               Ms. Higgins:  Tell us about any fads or trends in Monmouth County that you remember. You've mentioned your love of music.  Did your husband have any hobbies?      Ms. Kaufman:  Not specifically.  He always said, "You know, you need people to create, and you need people to appreciate creativity, and that's who I am."  My husband was a typical intellectual person.  After he retired, there would be at least five newspapers in the house daily.  He was an avid reader and was at the library a great deal.  He told me that when he was a kid and his mother would say, "Lights out!" at bedtime, he would have a flashlight in bed with him, and read until all hours of the morning.  He was a very easy man to live with, a lovely person, and we did take some nice trips together because he was interested in historical things like I was.     Ms. Higgins:  Where did you go?    Ms. Kaufman:  Well, we went to England a few times.  Years ago, when I was a kid, I always used to visit an aunt who owned a very old set of the Book of Knowledge.  In one of those books were pictures of England -- particularly one -- a copy of a painting of two little princes who were murdered around the time of Richard III.  Their bodies were buried under the steps of the Tower of London  that painting haunted me.  It  was so beautiful and sad.  Eventually, when I went to England, I visited the Tower and asked one of the uniformed Beefeater guides about them.  I found out what that historical moment was all about.  Then later, we visited Italy, which was beautiful.        Ms. Higgins:  North or south?    Ms. Kaufman:  We went basically north the first time.  We went to Rome, Florence, and Venice.  The second time we drove down from Milan to Sorrento.  That's about as far south as I got.  We just loved Italy.  It's so full of treasures -- it's amazing. We saw operas outdoors in Rome, in the ancient Baths of Carcalla.  We also visited Paris.  We saw Opera in Paris too, and enjoyed it.  We also traveled through France.  My husband never liked tours.  He would always rent a car and drive it himself.  It was a wonderful way to see the countryside.  After he retired we took a trip to Scotland.       Ms. Higgins:  Aberdeen?    Ms. Kaufman:  We didn't get to Aberdeen. It is all the way over on the East Coast.  We went to Robert Burns country. We were in Edinburgh, and luckily we just came the day of  the tattoo and saw a wonderful parade.  We also visited the Isle of Skye and the Isle of Mull and Iona in the Hebrides.      Ms. Higgins: Have you ever been to Nova Scotia?    Ms. Kaufman:  Yes, three times.  It's a beautiful province.  The landscape is so magnificent.  There was an entertainer up there called Jonallan.  John Allen was his name, but everyone called him Jonallen.  We saw him several times, and he always sang the loveliest Scottish folk songs.  My husband and I also went to an Elderhostel in Nova Scotia where there was Scottish dancing and storytelling and it was at the Gaelic College of St. Anne's in Baddeck, Cape Breton Island.      Ms. Higgins:   What feelings do you have as we enter the Millennium?  Are there any comments or advice? What would you like to leave with the future generations?     Ms. Kaufman:  Well, I can't solve the problems, and there's a lot of them.  But just care for one another, I think is about it.  Just know that the person you are with is a human being and is entitled to your respect, and if somebody's in trouble, well, you help them as best you can.  Give them as much help as they need.  Children nowadays are having such troubles in school, it's frightening.  Sometimes you expect serious difficulties with adults, but not necessarily kids.    Ms. Higgins:  What do you think of your Monmouth County Library?     Ms. Kaufman:  I love it, it is amazing.  Any knowledge needed or wanted can be gained in that library.  At one point I wanted to volunteer at a major hospital.  Information I gained led me to Robert Wood Johnson where I have been volunteering for several years in the pediatric cancer center.  Four years ago I was appointed by the Dean of Medical School, Dr. Harold Paz, to be a community representative on the Institutional Review Board of Robert Wood Johnson.  A team of doctors and myself representing the average person read many research papers to decide what would be approved for testing.  These are all different types of tests that people might volunteer for.  We have to approve them first under strict conditions.  If I come across something I believe a person would not understand readily, i.e. medical terms, difficult language etc.,  I would ask for clarification and a possible rewrite.  On a monthly basis, I receive large packages containing these reports.  Very often I take them to the library to read.  There I can spread them out on one of the large tables and fully concentrate on the material.  Then I'm ready for the monthly meeting of the IRB Board at Robert Wood Johnson Hospital.  Besides being a haven for study and learning, the wonderful Monmouth County Library has a full variety of books on any subject you may wish to know about.  I have found the staff extremely helpful, and always pleasant.  In addition, the lecture presentations, movies, plays, poetry readings, and concerts are very high caliber.      Ms. Higgins:  Well thank you, thank you very much, Ms. Kaufman.    Ms. Kaufman:  Thank you, Mrs. Higgins.  
MonmouthCounty;Edward Eastmond;1936;2000;      Edward Eastmond, 1936, 2000        Remembering the 20th Century: An Oral History of Monmouth County    Date of Interview: June 15, 2000  Names of Interviewers: Douglas Aumack and Flora Higgins  Premises of Interview: Monmouth County Library Headquarters, Manalapan, NJ  Birthdates of subjects: Edward Eastmond -- November 26, 1936                                              Marian Eastmond -- May 4, 1937    Interviewer: How did you happen to come to Monmouth County and be here during the twentieth century?      Mr. Eastmond's father    Mr. Eastmond: Well, my father and mother were both born in Monmouth County. Mom was born in Union Beach, and my father was born in Matawan. We've had family in the County since the 1800s.    Interviewer:  Were these farming people? Tell us how they managed to live, and a little bit about your life as you grew up.    Mr. Eastmond: My grandparents were farmers in Matawan and Middletown. My father was a boat builder for C.C. Galbraith in Keyport, and he was a blacksmith. He did a lot of tin knocking and iron work. Mom was a homemaker, and she raised eight children. We were all fortunate enough to go through school and graduate from high school. One brother has graduated from college.      Mr. Eastmond (standing) with his mother  Interviewer: You say your father was a blacksmith?    Mr. Eastmond: Yes.    Interviewer: Was he one of the last blacksmiths in the County? And did he do horseshoes as well?    Mr. Eastmond: Oh no.  No, he was not a farrier. My father used to bend the keels for the boats. This was for the lifeboats for the Coast Guard and the Navy. They heated the keel and then physically bent them, and hit them with sledgehammers to get the proper curve of the steel or iron.    Interviewer: And that was Galbraith Boat Building?    Mr. Eastmond: C.C. Galbraith on Manchester Avenue in Keyport.    Interviewer: How long have they been in business? Tell us about this boat building place.    Mr. Eastmond: I don't know when it started, but they went out of business I guess in the 1950s. I'm not sure, but I think they went out of business somewhere around that time. My father worked there all during Word War II.    Interviewer: Did you go to school and high school in Union Beach? What kind of transportation did you have?      Ed Eastmond in grammar school  Mr. Eastmond: I went to school at Union Beach Grammar School, and we walked. My mode of transportation was my feet. And it was uphill both ways. (laughter) I don't think there was any  bus service or anything like that in Union Beach. There was a train station in Union Beach, and it would take you eventually into New York or down to Seaside, or down that way along the shore. I don't remember any bus service during my early years growing up.    Interviewer: Where did you go to high school?    Mr. Eastmond: In Keyport.    Interviewer: You say you were one of eight children. Can you tell me a little bit about your family?    Mr. Eastmond: I have an older sister. Her name is Catherine Joan Fuller now. She married Frank Fuller. He was also born and raised in Union Beach. I have an older brother, Dave. He now lives in Nacomis, Florida. And then there was me  I was born in 1936 in Union Beach. The house I was born in is still standing. My sister, Virginia, now lives in Nacomis, Florida also. Her last name now is Poling: she married Frank Poling. His father and my father were very good friends growing up, and I believe he was born in Keyport. Then there is my brother, Billy. He now lives in Frenchtown. He is the one who graduated from college. He is an electrical engineer. He married a girl named Catherine Donaruma. They had a farm in Holmdel, the Donaruma Farm.    Interviewer: But your parents were not farmers?    Mr. Eastmond: No, my father grew up on a farm. He just couldn't take his father's ability to keep him in line, I guess.    Interviewer:  What did you kids do as teenagers?    Mr. Eastmond: I was busy working. (laughter)    Mrs. Eastmond: Well, we went swimming. Everybody could go swimming because it didn't cost anything. We swam in Maddy's Creek, and also down at the beachfront at the shore. We went roller skating down at Colicchio Roller Rink in Keansburg.    Interviewer: How did you get there?    Mrs. Eastmond: Well, there was a bus that went from Keansburg to Union Beach and Keyport, and it went into Perth Amboy.    Interviewer: You grew up in Union Beach also, Marian?    Mrs. Eastmond: I didn't move there until I was in seventh grade.    Interviewer: And you met Ed then?    Mrs. Eastmond: No, we did not meet until we were seniors in high school.    Interviewer: What was your job while you were a teenager?    Mr. Eastmond: I got a job when I was a sophomore in high school at the Keyport Greenhouses. I worked there after school, beginning at three o'clock. I worked until six o'clock and some nights even later, depending on the holiday season. Saturdays and Sundays, I worked there, also. And I worked there until I joined the Navy.    Interviewer: Was that for your personal money, or was that to give to the family?    Mr. Eastmond: To assist Mom and help feed the family.    Interviewer: Did your other siblings have jobs to help support the family?    Mr. Eastmond: Well, I guess mine was the most steady job in the household, except my Dad's. My brother Dave didn't work...he was in sports. My sister Joan did work, yes she did. And she paid room and board the same as I did once I started working.    Interviewer: Did you go down to the shore much? Tell us about the shore.    Mr. Eastmond: Occasionally we would go down to Sea Bright and go swimming. I went to the Fireman's Park down there, do you remember that one? We always had about five or six of us that would get into my friend's convertible, a 1952 Buick Convertible. It was a nice car. The man's name was Eddy Lanquist. We would help chip in for gas to go there and back, and it cost you a quarter to go swimming, I think.    Interviewer: And there was no parking fee or anything...you just paid a quarter and that was it?    Mr. Eastmond: You would pay for the parking, and I don't recall what that was. It was maybe a quarter to park there for a couple hours. And it cost you a quarter to go down to the beach.    Interviewer: Sea Bright was always a beautiful beach.    Mr. Eastmond: Oh yes, that was always fun.    Interviewer: Were there any other hobbies besides going to the beach? Did you watch movies?    Mr. Eastmond: No, not really. Once in awhile as a young child, I guess I was maybe six, my oldest sister would take those old enough to go to the movie in Keyport. My mother would give each of us a quarter...    Interviewer: And that's how much it cost?    Mr. Eastmond: No. It was fifteen cents to go to the movie, and it was ten cents to ride the bus. So you could ride the bus one way. You could either ride the bus to the movie, or you could ride the bus coming home. So we had our choice.    Mrs. Eastmond: Or they could walk both ways and then have money for candy or whatever. (laughter)    Mr. Eastmond: Once in awhile we would do that, maybe once a month.    Interviewer: What were your favorite movies?    Mr. Eastmond: I don't know, it used to be The Phantom, and Buster Crabb had that space flight or something like that to Mars.     Interviewer: There was a famous restaurant in Union Beach. Tell us about it.    Mr. Eastmond: Graziano's Italian Restaurant. My brother Dave used to date Esther Graziano, who is the younger of the two sisters. They were both in the same class.    Interviewer: But that's no longer there, is it?    Mr. Eastmond: No, that's gone.    Interviewer: Did you follow the political life in Union Beach?    Mr. Eastmond: Not until I got older and was able to vote. I do recall some of the older, now deceased mayors, like Ed Haug, Tom Hennessey, Mr. Scholer, and Carmine Stoppiello.    Interviewer: What were some of their accomplishments?    Mr. Eastmond: I think primarily just trying to keep the books balanced and running a town with no further debt than what it already had...to keep the debt where it was and keep everything on an even keel. At that time it was very tough when the town had been in debt and receivership, so there wasn't much they could do. Mr. Stoppiello, a more recent mayor, brought about many improvements in the town, especially in the beach front area and the school system.  He negotiated with Dr. Nogueira for Red Bank to accept our students to Red Bank High School.    Interviewer: Right. Were you there when they put the roads in? Can you tell us about that?    Mr. Eastmond: I can recall as a child of five or six, or even up to maybe ten years old, the town had a grader. We had dirt roads and at least once a summer, or every couple of months, they would come by and grade the road, so it was fairly smooth. Then they would pack it down again a little bit and go over it with sodium. They would put a layer of that on to keep the dust down.    Mrs. Eastmond: It was that way while I was living there, so even when I was in high school, they were still grading the roads.    Mr. Eastmond: The man that did the grading on the road was a qualified grader, and he was also the Police Chief.    Mrs. Eastmond: That was Richard Trembley.    Mr. Eastmond: Richard Trembley, Sr.    Interviewer: Well, how was crime in Union Beach?    Mr. Eastmond: Crime? I don't know.    Interviewer: If the Police Chief had the time to grade the roads, it couldn't have been too bad. (laughter)    Mrs. Eastmond: It was shocking when anything ever happened.    Mr. Eastmond: Yes, it really was. I don't recall any crime as a child in the town. I really don't. Of course I was a child.    Interviewer: Were you aware, though, of locking the doors and the car?    Mr. Eastmond: No.    Interviewer: You didn't lock your doors?      Marian Eastmond with her father  Mrs. Eastmond: You didn't lock the house. In fact if a neighbor came over and knocked on the door, if you didn't answer, they might open it and say, "Anybody home?" If nobody answered, they would just close the door and went on their way. We didn't lock the doors!    Interviewer: Sounds like a very close knit community.    Mr. Eastmond: A very, very good community to be raised in.    Mrs. Eastmond: Yes it was. My mother was a widow, and it was hard for her. I used to take care of my brothers during the summer. I would put them in a wagon and pull them down to the creek, and we would go swimming. And the dog would come, too. And nobody ever said anything...he was not leashed or anything like that. He would go swimming with us. (laughter) Then I would bring them back home, and  wash their clothes and put them on the line. Since I was in charge of the household during the day, I did the wash and everything, too. We had no hot water, so I heated all the hot water on the stove. I filled up the washer--we had the old, wringer type washer--and I'd wash the clothes. You started off with the white wash so that you did not have to change the water. You would wash and rinse that, run it through the wringer, and then put it on the line. And I remember because I had to climb on a chair in order to reach the line to hang up the sheets. I would have to redo sheets sometimes because they touched the ground...I could not manage. I was thirteen or fourteen years old at the time.    Interviewer: And also you were keeping track of the two siblings?    Mrs. Eastmond: And I was watching the two boys, yes.    Interviewer: And you did this while going to school, or was this during the summer?      Marion's parents, Mr. and Mrs. Rutherford    Mrs. Eastmond: During the summer. During school time, I was in charge of my one  brother, who was six years old. My other brother was younger. My mother was pregnant when my father died. He had a heart attack. So my brother had to be boarded...there was nobody to take care of him during the wintertime. He would come home on the weekends and then go back.    Interviewer: Where did your mother work?    Mrs. Eastmond: When we first moved down, she worked for Delco Battery in New Brunswick. She went to work in a carpool, and then she finally got a car and drove. She was a comptometer operator and a bookkeeper. And it was a long day for her. She would leave at six o'clock in the morning, and she would be lucky to come back at six o'clock at night for dinner. When we first moved to Union Beach, we lived in a converted garage. It had a stove that gave us the heat and the cooking. The side of the stove had oil burners, and I had to fill up a can and put it on the side of the stove so it would feed the fire. It was a kerosene stove.    Interviewer: How did you get the oil...was that your responsibility?    Mrs. Eastmond: They would come and fill the oil tank outside. But if we ran out, then I would take a five-gallon can and walk down to Leonard's. I would fill the can and then bring it back home. So that's how we would fill that.    Interviewer: How long was that walk?    Mrs. Eastmond: It wasn't too far, but the can was heavy coming home.    Mr. Eastmond: It would be easier going there.    Mrs. Eastmond: Yes. We had no indoor bathroom. We had a chemical toilet for the winter that had to be emptied into an outhouse. But we managed, you know.    Interviewer: It would seem as though you were cheerful through it. I perceive that in your personality.    Mrs. Eastmond: Yes, it was a wonderful place to grow up when you didn't have a lot. It was all there. I used to walk to the library, and I probably read every book in the library.    Interviewer: Did the bookmobile come to Union Beach?    Mrs. Eastmond: Not that I was aware of, no.    Interviewer: Where did you go to school?    Mrs. Eastmond: I went to St. Joseph's. I transferred from St. Steven's in Arlington, New Jersey, down to St. Joseph's when I came here.    Interviewer: When you ran out of books to read in the library, as avid readers do, was there any way you could ask the librarian to get you some other books?      Marian and Ed Eastmond  Mrs. Eastmond: I didn't know of any. Maybe I wasn't aware of it. My grandfather was an avid reader, also. He belonged to the Book-of-the-Month Club, and he used to give me books when he was finished with them. I always read beyond my grade level and everything. I went to Keyport High School. They required tuition to go to a Catholic high school, and we were not able to do that. So I went to a public high school, and then I went to Glassboro State Teacher's College.    Interviewer: And you became a teacher?    Mrs. Eastmond: Yes.    Interviewer: Do you remember the Studebaker Place?    Mrs. Eastmond: Yes, in Keyport. It was across the street from the high school. In fact, Ed's father was a friend with Mr. Washington.    Interviewer: His name was Washington?    Mr. Eastmond: He was a very nice person.    Interviewer: He was there a long time in the community.    Mr. Eastmond: Yes, his name was Percy Washington. My father was  good friends with him.    Mrs. Eastmond: He was at the house and everything, and he came to visit Ed's father in the hospital before he died. He always would come to the house and visit him.    Interviewer: Was there a large African American community in Union Beach or Keyport?    Mrs. Eastmond: No.    Mr. Eastmond: In Union Beach growing up, as I recall, I was told that they have "no Blacks allowed" in the deeds of the town. I don't know this for a fact, though.    Interviewer: That was not uncommon in Monmouth County.    Mr. Eastmond: No, but I had nothing to do with it. When we went to high school, we did have Black classmates. And we got along well with them.    Mrs. Eastmond: Yes.    Mr. Eastmond: We had a nice class in high school. We really did.    Interviewer: So there really wasn't an environment of racism?    Mrs. Eastmond: No, there weren't that many African Americans in each class, to be perfectly honest. I think in our graduating class, there were maybe two girls and three boys.    Interviewer: How large was your class?    Mrs. Eastmond: Over one hundred.    Interviewer: After you got out of Glassboro, what did you do?    Mrs. Eastmond: I taught my first year in Keyport, down in the Lockport section. It was a small, four-room school. It was pre-primary, and pre-primary went all day long. It was their first year of school, and they went full time. They had one and a half hours for lunch, though. So they walked home, and then they came back.    Interviewer: Was this day-long schedule controversial?    Mrs. Eastmond: No, everybody was in agreement with that, pretty much. I think everybody liked the fact that the children went to school. Toward the end of the year, my class had started to read. So because they had a full-time session, there was more that could be done. It was wonderful...it was wonderful for me as a teacher, because you had that break in the afternoon. I could prepare art lessons and things like that for them, and they did so many things.    Interviewer: What was your average size class?    Mrs. Eastmond: My first day of school, they just kept coming and coming... (laughter) Many of the parents hadn't enrolled them. Now I was supposed to have a class of thirty-three, and I wound up with a class of fifty-two, my first day of teaching.    Interviewer: Did you have helpers?    Mrs. Eastmond: No.    Interviewer: These were five-year olds?    Mrs. Eastmond: These were five-year old children, and the nurse came for awhile in the morning and took down the names of those students who had not been previously enrolled. And then she left. And when I went out on the play yard with my students, I had them in a circle and we were playing farmer-in-the-dell and typical, classical games. Then two other teachers decided to have their children come out on the playground at the same time. I was young, and when these children saw a teacher out there with an organized game, they joined my children...and I lost three children.    Interviewer: Oh no!    Mrs. Eastmond: Three mothers came walking down the street with their children. But there was never a problem.    Interviewer: The children had gone home?    Mrs. Eastmond: Yes, they went home. (laughter)    Interviewer: This wasn't the lunch hour?    Mrs. Eastmond: No, they went home. Well, that really taught me a lesson about needing to kind of ask the other teachers not to put their children out there at the same time. The school, upon realizing that I had such a large class, started to find another teacher. But by the time they found another teacher, my children were all used to having me as their teacher. And it made it very difficult when some children had to go to another teacher. It was very hard. So they put two pre-primary classes in that school and moved the third grade up to the other school.    Interviewer: Did they have enough schools and enough schoolrooms to accommodate all these students of yours? Did you think they did?    Mrs. Eastmond: Yes, because when they divided the class, I think I wound up with twenty-eight students. This was like heaven after fifty-two! (laughter)    Interviewer: Were these all children from Keyport?    Mrs. Eastmond: Oh yes. They could walk home, and so they were all from the neighborhood. This was very nice. The mothers came and dropped their children off...they walked them to school and walked them back and forth. Mothers were not all working then, as they are today. They were home. It was unusual to have a working mother.    Interviewer: Did Keyport have a large Hispanic population when you began teaching? Or when did that immigration happen?    Mrs. Eastmond: No, I only had three black children in my first class. The rest were all white. And there were no Hispanic children.    Interviewer: Would you care to comment on procedures when you began teaching and as you continued, and as they are now?    Mrs. Eastmond: Well, let's see. At the time, I really loved teaching. I enjoyed teaching. It was never a job, it just was a joy. The children needed an education and the parents backed the teacher, and I never had a problem. I never experienced any problems with teaching until I went back, and I taught middle school, I think.    Interviewer: What year? And how long were you out of teaching?    Mrs. Eastmond: I taught up until I had my first child, which was four and a half years, and then I substituted. After that I had a son who had seizure disorder. So I worked weekends at the hospital. I worked at Bayshore Hospital as a unit secretary in the Emergency Room.    Interviewer: What year did you stop teaching?    Mrs. Eastmond: I taught from September 1959 until 1965, when he was born. When Edward was about two years old, we had a strike in Union Beach. It was a teacher's strike.    Interviewer: That was 1967?    Mrs. Eastmond: Yes.    Interviewer: Please continue commenting on the teachers' organizations and your impressions of the educational process then and later when you resumed teaching.    Mrs. Eastmond: I taught my first year in Keyport. Then I taught my second year in Union Beach. From then on, I taught in Union Beach. I had applied at Union Beach in the beginning, because I felt that it was my town. I felt I was a good teacher, and I wanted to teach my children in my own community. At the time that I started in Union Beach, we were on split-sessions. There was not enough room at Union Beach for the number of children that we had, so they were in the process of building the school. I had thirty-eight children on a split-session in first grade in Union Beach during my first year there. That was difficult, too, because you did not have the access to your classroom all of the time. You taught one session from eight in the morning until  noon, and the next session ran from like twelve-thirty to four-thirty in the afternoon. We switched them halfway through the year so that one group would not in any way be discriminated against. I found it difficult because if I needed to work with any child who was having difficulty reading, there was no place in the school to go. What amounted to our school library was in the basement, and it would be used during the school time.  I even sat on the stairways with some of my children, in order to try and help them with their reading. And this was fine with the parents. I did this with the children who were having difficulties in order to bring them up to grade level. But that was hard, because my first year I wound up with five reading levels by the end of the year. It was very hard in a classroom trying to get all this accomplished.    Interviewer: Could you tell us a little bit more about Bayshore Community Hospital?    Mrs. Eastmond: When I had my first child, I left the school and only substituted. I stayed home to raise my children. When I had my third, I didn't work full-time either, because even though he was in school, he had medical problems. I went to work at Bayshore Hospital around 1977.    Interviewer: Would you comment on the controversies that occasionally surrounded Bayshore's activities?    Mrs. Eastmond: In what way?    Interviewer: Some people said that the Hospital was not appropriately outfitted to do what it had to do with emergencies, and that the doctors were not adequately trained. There was a lot of that in the press at the time. I am looking for substantiation of that, but frankly, I can't find it.    Mrs. Eastmond: When I started to work at Bayshore on the weekends, there were times that we were, I would say, extremely busy. And there were other times when we would go periods of time with no patients, especially on a Sunday morning. Now on a Sunday morning we had a doctor named Boudreau, who was affiliated with the Army, and he would work there. He would train staff, and he would give them extra training. What a wonderful doctor he was! And he included me in his training on Sunday mornings, if we were slow. Sunday morning usually amounted to some left over Saturday night activity. Then maybe at eleven o'clock in the morning, it would start picking up and we would get very busy.    Mr. Eastmond: The softball leagues broke their ankles.    Mrs. Eastmond: Or people got up and then decided they really didn't feel well, and they didn't think they would make it until Monday. So they thought they would go into the hospital. I think we had a very good staff. We had Dr. Scotti, who was in charge with the Emergency Room. He was excellent. He had quite a background. I would say sometimes, yes, we were short of staff. But I think it was hard to know how to staff a hospital that was starting off, also.    Interviewer: Let's talk about when you got back into teaching. Now you taught from 1959 to 1965. Can we talk about the Teacher's Union or lack of this?    Mrs. Eastmond: I wasn't really aware of a Teacher's Union. We had a teacher's organization or association, and it was a group for ourselves, really. We got together and raised money. I was involved in it, and we put on plays in Union Beach to raise money for different things. I became more aware of conflict in either 1967 or 1968, I am not sure. This is when Union Beach had a teacher's strike. I did a lot of substituting that year because many teachers were taking time off. I think that if they had accrued sick time, they were taking this time off. Teachers were angry...sometimes to the point where they involved the children, which was not right. They maybe would try to get the children on the side of the teaching staff. I am saying this as a precursor to what I did. I crossed the picket line. I had been in the classroom, and I had seen what was going on. They were upset because the contract of one of the teachers, and I guess he was the president of the teacher's association, was not being renewed. So this was one of the reasons that they were going out on strike. It is not my judgment as to whether his contract should have been renewed or not.    Interviewer: So this strike was regarding protecting one teacher, primarily?    Mrs. Eastmond: Yes. Or maybe the rest felt that this was an issue that they had to settle...that was the conflict between a board and the teacher's association.    Interviewer: When you went back to teaching in Red Bank, how did you find education then?    Mrs. Eastmond: Teaching changed. I went back as a basic skills teacher, part-time. I can't even remember what year that was. Maybe it was 1988.    Interviewer: What had changed?    Mrs. Eastmond: There was a big change. There was less respect for the teaching position, I think. Students were outspoken, and there was more disruption in the classroom. We never used to have that years ago. If you had a disruptive child, you could more or less speak to him or her quietly. And I found that was not the case in some instances then. It's hard for me to say. I figured that maybe it was me coming back into the profession, and that I had to make adjustments. As time went on, there was a barrier placed between the teacher and the student. There was no more hugging a student because they did a good job, and you couldn't put a hand on a student to console them or whatever. These things were frowned upon, and we were told not to touch the student because of the way it could be perceived. I think it really was a disservice to both of us, it really was. I had children who needed a hug that I could not give. And these were children who needed it more than any children that I had ever taught. They were children who came from backgrounds where some of them didn't even have their parents. I had one boy when I first started there who, when I put my arm around him, started to cry. And the teacher that I was in the classroom with said, "Mrs. Eastmond, I know it's time for you to leave, but please sit here and stay with him." And I found out later that this was the first breakthrough with the child because his mother had died of AIDS, and the children were not permitted to go see her before she died in the hospital. He had not been able to say goodbye, and they couldn't break through in counseling. And this was the first time...but you see, it was a human touch! And he was now in a family  that had combined the children from this family and the children from another family together. They were doing the very best that they could, but there was not a lot of time to go around. And now you were cutting off that other avenue to reach the child, which was the teaching avenue, by the rules and regulations that were being set up.    Interviewer: Why did you join the Navy, Mr. Eastmond?    Mr. Eastmond: I joined in 1955, and I had these grandiose ideas that I could help change the world by serving Uncle Sam. WWII was very vivid in my mind, and then Korea broke out in 1951. I was in the eighth grade and I had always wanted to be a sailor, so I decided I was going to join the Navy. When I turned eighteen, I enlisted.    Interviewer: Do you recall any influences that made you want to become a sailor? Your family maybe?    Mr. Eastmond: My uncle served in the Navy during WWII. So maybe I thought I'd get to travel and get to see the world. I did join also so I could get an education in the field of my enslavement later! (laughter)    Interviewer: What was your enslavement?    Mr. Eastmond: The electrical field. I was an electrician in the Navy, and then I went on to work for Jersey Central Power and Light Company, which is now GPU Energy. I retired as an Electrical Test Department Supervisor, working out of Wall Township.    Interviewer: You must have had a lot of business with all the houses going up?    Mr. Eastmond: The Power and Light Company did, but it didn't affect me as much. We were in the process of building and testing equipment going to substations. That's where you would take the high voltage, bring it into a substation, and step it down for usable power.    Interviewer: I can't resist asking you to comment on the services provided by Jersey Central Power and Light and GPU. There has been so much in the papers about GPU lately.    Mr. Eastmond: They can't get me now! Lord strike me dead, but we never lost power at my house with JCPL. Then I retired, and in less than a year we had three outages. It had nothing to do with me, but it had to do with the equipment getting older. Also, people were buying bigger air conditioners, and the transformer outside of our house said goodbye. So in the process of saying goodbye, it took us out of power three times.    Interviewer: Where do you live now?    Mr. Eastmond: The same place since I have been married, 206 West Street in Union Beach.    Interviewer: You still live in Union Beach?    Mr. Eastmond: Yes.    Interviewer: What year did you retire?    Mr. Eastmond: August 1, 1993.    Interviewer: Did you suggest to anyone about the future of these transformers...about what problems might occur?    Mr. Eastmond: When I was working there, the company had a planning department. It was well staffed by people who knew what was going on. They knew the demands for energy were going up all the time. They did plan as best they could for the future. Every year we would have a budget to replace certain transformers, not just the pole-type transformers, but also the substation transformers, which are bigger than this room. They would replace them with bigger, better, and more efficient ones. After awhile they had to cut back on the manpower. And as they did that, they would buy out people like myself and my brother. They just seemed to cut out the expertise that we had built up over the years. They just sliced it right off the top and got rid of it. Not that the younger people under us weren't qualified to take over, but they didn't have the field experience yet to fully take over. But they just said we were cut out, that was it, and we were gone. And the next guy was put in place to either swim or sink. In a way, and I'm not sure, but the outages that they had last year may have been part of some of that...you know, getting rid of all those people.    Mrs. Eastmond: Too many at one time.    Mr. Eastmond: Yes, too many at once. If you were fifty-five by a certain date, you were gone! They wouldn't guarantee your salary or your position.    Mrs. Eastmond: So you might as well retire. People who didn't really want to retire were not sure if they would have a job, or if they would have the job they were working in at that time. So most people took the retirement.    Interviewer: Were there any training sessions for the younger people who were going to take your jobs?    Mr. Eastmond: They decided that the engineering department they had in Morristown would be eliminated and transferred to Reading, Pennsylvania. That is quite a distance, and it's hard  when it's in a different state. Theoretically, it is not that the engineering couldn't be done by another company, but you wouldn't have the pulse of what was going on, that personal touch. I think that they could have maybe kept a skeleton crew of more experienced people, and gradually allowed them to go. But they didn't, they cut them all.    Mrs. Eastmond: There were more people coming in with book learning and degrees, but they didn't have the field experience. You really need a balance.    Interviewer: Before we leave the Navy, where did you serve?    Mr. Eastmond: I was on a destroyer.  I went to boot camp in Bainbridge, Maryland and went to school in Great Lakes, Illinois and learned electricity. Then I went aboard ship in Newport, Rhode Island, and then I was on a commissioning crew for a brand new ship out of Weston at that time. Then I was transferred to Mayport, Florida in 1958, and then I got out in 1959.    Interviewer: You were eligible for a lot of benefits, I hope?    Mr. Eastmond: No benefits.    Interviewer: How many ships did you serve on?    Mr. Eastmond: Two.    Interviewer: What were their names?    Mr. Eastmond: Jonas Ingram, which was a 938, and the Harverson, which is a 316. The Harverson was a DER, Destroyer Escort Radar, and its primary duty was to go up to 300 miles south of the Arctic Circle and go around in a circle. You would do that for thirty days, and then it would bring itself right back again to Newport, Rhode Island. Wonderful duty! The portholes looked like washing machines.    Interviewer:  Tell us about Union Beach today.    Mrs. Eastmond: It is beautiful now.    Mr. Eastmond: The State had a lot to do with funding the rebuilding. Town money was used to rebuild and bulkhead the waterfront along Union and Front Streets. They put in a nice, beautiful park and a nice, sloping beach. The sand goes right down into the water. Mayor Stoppiello had a great deal to do with applying for grants and matching funds.    Interviewer: The best kept secret in Monmouth County.    Mrs. Eastmond: Just about, but I think it's becoming better known because I came around there on the weekend, and you couldn't park any place. It's wonderful. There are umbrellas all out on the beach again now. I remember that when I first moved here we had a hurricane. The merry-go-round and stands at the beach were destroyed. And we never had them again after that. But that's where people would spend their time, and that's where they would take their children. You could go down to the beach and sit on the beach in the afternoon, and women would chat with other women and the children would play. The water wasn't real deep, and it was clean. On Pebble Beach you could see to the bottom of the water. It was really beautiful.    Interviewer: But now it has been restored somewhat?    Mrs. Eastmond: Oh yes. There were some older buildings that have been taken away. They had been damaged in more recent hurricanes. They had tried to have a restaurant or something. Jakeabob's Restaurant was previously the Sand Bar. Now they have a Fireman's Park that is down a little bit further. There is a continuation of a walk that goes along the beach and goes down to where the path is that goes over the old railroad tracks that kind of goes around through the beach and everything. The town itself, the houses, and everything, are being refurbished, and property values have been going up. Our oldest son lives two blocks away from us. As far as he is concerned, that is where he wants to live. The children go to the Union Beach School system, and they do very well in school. I am very pleased with the system and the reading ability and everything of my grandsons. Our other son, Paul, is home, and is looking for a home in Union Beach also. So I might wind up with the children close by. Ed's father was a volunteer fireman.    Mr. Eastmond: He was a volunteer fireman during the War years. He was the Fire Chief in 1943 in Union Beach. He did not serve in the Army or any military branch. At that time he was working building lifeboats for the Coast Guard and the Navy, working at Galbraith's.    Interviewer: Hammering the keels.      Ed Eastmond, Sr. served the Boro of Union Beach as Fire Chief in 1943  Mr. Eastmond: Yes  at that time the boats did not have a motor. They were all hand-powered lifeboats. After they built a boat, the Coast Guard would come in and tell them which boat they wanted. They told the workers to put it in the water, and they would test it. You would have to take that boat, take it out to the Bay, put it in the water and launch it, and then either two or four men would get on it with the rowing mechanism or the power mechanism that would drive the propeller to move the boat. And they had to get it to move at a certain rate of speed. But that's why my father didn't serve in the military, he was already in a government-type job, and needed at it. He was Fire Chief in 1943, and thirty years later to the day, I became Fire Chief in the same Fire Company. Of course the manpower at the time my father was Fire Chief was maybe twenty-five, because everybody else was in the service. But when I was Fire Chief, we had about 130 firemen, all volunteers. When he was Chief, there were maybe four fire trucks in town, and he couldn't get gas for them. But he had the trucks. When I was Chief, we had seven fire trucks. It was a nice experience.    Interviewer: I would guess your son is going to be a Fire Chief some day?    Mrs. Eastmond: No. Times have changed. Now with him working and everything. He doesn't have a steady eight-hour day. Today a lot of young people are working many more hours per day, and I don't think that leaves them time to do some of the volunteer work that maybe their parents did.    Mr. Eastmond: I used to go to work at eight o'clock in the morning and be home generally every day around five o'clock. My son goes to work now at seven in the morning and doesn't get home sometimes until seven or eight at night. My youngest son, Paul, drives a semi. And you don't know when he is going to be around or where he is driving.    Interviewer: I want to talk to Mrs. Eastmond a little more about the transformation in the environment between the teachers and students from 1965 and to 1988.  Do you have any comments about that?    Mrs. Eastmond: The children have a lot of anger, and children don't know how to handle anger. We've tried, and we've tried very hard. We brought different programs into the school system to diffuse children who we know are having problems and everything like that. But I think that so much has changed...there have been so many restrictions put on teachers as to what they can say, and what they can do, and so on and so forth. I don't know if that was such a good move. I could have children come and confide in me before. But when you put that barrier  that you are not supposed to cross over in either direction, I think it makes it harder. I have had children come to me and tell me they are pregnant, and they want to talk about things. There are children who maybe aren't being fed at home, and they have come and spoken to me. But they really don't want teachers to handle those things now. It is supposed to go through the nurse.    Interviewer: You have been very gracious in sharing your memories with us. If you were to have this archive read years from now, what would you like to say to the people in the next century? What would you like them to know about Monmouth County in the twentieth century? And is there any advice you would give to them?    Mrs. Eastmond: I hope that as time goes on, maybe people can get back to working a job that is an eight-hour day so that they have more time to spend with their families. Then maybe we won't have to rely on a lot of outside services to provide what the family should. I hope that Union Beach continues to be the type of town that it is today, where you have families and extended families in the same town. I think it's wonderful because my grandsons can come over after school, and if they need homework help or anything else, they are only two blocks away from me. And I know of other families in the Beach that are the same, whose children and grandchildren are still in the same town. We have always helped one another. And I hope that continues. I'd like to see somehow that the town could find maybe more broad-based tax, so that small communities, which don't have industry or whatever, are not burdened with the full load of the tax system for the town. What would you like to add, Ed?    Mr. Eastmond: Thinking back on what I did growing up, joining the Fire Department when I was sixteen and staying in it for close to thirty years, I would like to see the State and County not get so involved in those departments. I think they should be left volunteer departments and not paid workers. Volunteers have always been good people, and you can't get a more dedicated staff than a volunteer because they want to be there. The tax burden in each town now, and I don't care what town you talk about, is too high. In another hundred years, God bless them, I don't know what they'll do. I hope there is a better way. But volunteers are a good way of maintaining fire, first aid, emergency medical services, etc.    Mrs. Eastmond: And community.    Mr. Eastmond: And community help.    Mrs. Eastmond: Because that pulls the community together. It's your uncle that's on this thing, and it's your neighbor that's on that thing. They look out for the people that they are out to help. It's not somebody who is hired, comes in, and then goes home at the end of the day. I know when Ed would be out in the middle of the night for a fire or whatever,  newspapers would be calling me for information and everything else. So when he was out at a fire, the household was pretty much awake because of what was going on. These people always safeguarded everybody. Now you are not allowed to burn leaves and weeds  with pollution and all, but every year they used to burn back the weeds so that you wouldn't have a surprise fire maybe during the day, when many of the men were working. And they would safeguard all the houses that were anywhere near the edge of those marshes. Things change, you know, in the name of progress.    Interviewer:  What changes in Monmouth County have you seen that you really like?    Mrs. Eastmond: For one thing, the library system. I would have to say absolutely that. Even from the time that my children were maybe four or five we used to go down to Shrewsbury and go to the children's library there. They loved it, and that was their introduction to a big, main library. Everybody is so helpful, and then if I want a book or anything, I just have to ask. If they don't have it, they get it from a branch. So being networked the way they are today  is wonderful. And now with the system being on computer, we can go in and access things that way.    Interviewer: I cannot think of a happier note on which to conclude this interview, unless you have something you would like to add?    Mrs. Eastmond: I don't know, I didn't expect to do this today.    Interviewer: Could you just tell us about this bag and about the school blockwatch?    Mr. Eastmond: Well it was very good for the family. My mother made up a grocery bag out of canvas. My father sewed it at Galbraith's. He took it to the sail shop, and sewed this big, canvas bag together. Every morning my mother would give this to one of us children, on our way to school, and tell us to drop it off at Devon's Grocery Store. And in that bag would be a list of groceries we needed. So we would drop the bag off. On the way home, one of us was designated to go and pick the bag up from the grocery store and carry it home. At that time we were living on Park Avenue, and it's almost a half-mile from Devon's store to Park Avenue. You would carry this big bag, struggling home with the groceries for the day.    Interviewer: And was coal in there, too?     Mr. Eastmond: No. When we were living on Edmonds Avenue during the War, we only had one stove for heat. Of course you had to have a coupon for kerosene. Devon's had the kerosene distribution center. You would give her the coupon, pay for the kerosene, and they would pump out a gallon into the can you held up, and then you had to carry that home.    Interviewer: During the War, how did you handle the blackouts?    Mrs. Eastmond: Sometimes we went to sleep. (laughter) During that time I was in Arlington, New Jersey. The warden would come around and make sure everybody's shades were down and the lights were out. He would come around and check everything. We used to sit in the dark and talk if it was early enough. I remember the adults sitting around and everything. The raids came by surprise, of course, lots of times. So you might be visiting someone, and you couldn't leave then until the "all clear" sound was heard. So we children many times would fall asleep by the time the "all clear" happened. I can remember the adults would sit around, talk, or sometimes they would sing. We had a family that liked music. We would get together and our entertainment was one person playing the piano, somebody else playing another instrument, etc. That was on my grandmother's side. They always had a wonderful time, and she came from a family with thirteen children.    Mr. Eastmond: During blackouts we might be in the living room listening to radio programs. You would have your shades drawn, and we'd all sit there in the dark and listen to The Inner Sanctum and The Green Hornet and all those old shows. Then you'd hear the "all clear."    Interviewer: Thank you again, Mr. and Mrs. Eastmond.
MonmouthCounty;Ed and Jim Lang;1916;2000;Ed and Jim Lang, 1916, 2000        Remembering The 20th Century: An Oral History of Monmouth County    Date of Interview: September 24, 2000  Name of Interviewer: Ellen Williams  Premises of Interview: Ed Lang's home, Farmingdale, NJ  Birthdates of Subjects: Jim Lang, November 20, 1947                                                    Ed Lang, May 31, 1916                                                  Ms. Williams: Today we have a unique situation where father and son are being interviewed together. We have Mr. Ed Lang and his son, Mr. Jim Lang, and we will be doing a combined oral history with them. They both are very involved in civic programs and we will be hearing more about those. I think we might want to begin with the discussion with actually where Mr. Ed Lang lives. We were talking about Farmingdale and exactly what the post office is and where the Howell border is, and so maybe we might begin about that. What's the distinction about this?    Ed Lang: Well, to begin with, Farmingdale is roughly less than one square mile, and Howell Township is sixty-four square miles, roughly. First of all, our mail, going way back, used to come out of Farmingdale Post Office and was delivered into parts of Howell Township. We had to put our address down as Farmingdale, although we did not live in Farmingdale. And today it stands. This part of Howell gets all of its mail from Farmingdale from south of the Boro boundary line with Howell to the 195 overpass now, eastward to Wall Township and westward to within a mile of Highway 9. Even though these residents have to write "Farmingdale" as their address, they do not live in Farmingdale. Earlier, Farmingdale mail delivery extended even further across Highway 9 to the Jackson line. When I first moved here with my family around 1932, we heard how even earlier the part of Squankum that we lived in was called Lower Squankum, and that it had a post office with a Lower Squankum post mark and that Farmingdale, before it split off from Howell Township and was incorporated around 1909 or 1919, was called Upper Squankum. The roads in my earliest days here were pretty bad. They were unpaved and a lot of them were of poor construction. It was an adventure sometimes to travel between here and Lakewood whether you lived on this road, or were passing through here. It is interesting that Lakewood and Farmingdale still officially refer to this road as Squankum Road at either end as we residents did for as long as I can remember, but that the county calls it Lakewood-Farmingdale Road in the middle in between the two ends that are still known as Squankum. They also refer to it as County 524 and County 547. Not very descriptive. Now the post office and the police department refer to it as Lakewood- Farmingdale as well, since the adoption of the 911 emergency phone service which was installed as well a few years ago. This road is said to have been originally named after the area of Squankum which was where the Native-American Leni-Lenape Indians once lived. It was here, somewhere near the Manasquan River crossing that the braves left their women and children while they went on hunting expeditions for food. The old Quaker Burial Ground is still there as well. Much of the original road was said to be original Indian hunting paths and horse and later horse drawn roadway. The renaming of the middle section of the Squankum Road to that of Lakewood-Farmingdale Road and 524-547 seems to be another move away from the early origins of the area and everyone’s loss. During my earliest days here, Squankum Road had more business and traffic than the area that later became Route 9 in parts of Howell Township did in those times. There were hotels, restaurants, general stores, and taverns, and the Lower Squankum Post Office years ago, not to mention the General Store that housed the Post Office and the Squankum Inn, which was a little north of the Old Squankum Tavern and across from the Squankum Mill. The county developed the roads here then, and not the state. During the winters and springs, and sometimes during the often-rainy Novembers, the road would usually break up and become nearly impassable. This usually happened during the spring thaw. I remember down around Martin Nist’s farm along the Squankum Road in Howell past where the New Jersey Natural Gas Plant is today that the road would heave and be almost impassable. Travelers and locals alike would get their cars and trucks stuck right in the middle of Squankum Road going to and from Lakewood. A couple of farmers earned money pulling out these vehicles for around two dollars or two dollars and a half and the traveler knew that that was a cheap price to be back on the way so quickly. I remember it  we almost got stuck ourselves different times, and we’d have to get out and dig ourselves through. And that was only from the mud. Now the snowstorms were really something. I clearly remember that after snowstorms this road was a very bad road. Different times, the county couldn't reopen the road because their equipment at that time wasn't up to the five and six foot snow banks. Some places had heavy drifting of over five and six feet deep. They did not use snow fences then either, which probably allowed the drifts on the road to get much higher. On those occasions when it was at the worst he county asked many local farmers to come out and shovel the snow off of the road. This was during the Depression and the pay was fifty cents an hour for shoveling snow. That was good pay then. Even with hand shoveling, there were different places where we had to cut off of the road and cut a new road, onto private property, and ride on the land near the road instead. And you'd shovel and then drive maybe sometimes one hundred to two hundred fifty feet off of the road to avoid the worst drifts and to get to where it was higher ground and the wind blew, and the snow wasn't as deep, so you could get through. At that time, we were in the pig business, and it was hard to get into the driveways, hard to get into our own place, and it was a real struggle, and everywhere anyone did go, they used tire chains on the wheels. Today, you very seldom ever see tire chains used on the wheels. Most cars don’t even have the clearance underneath to use them if they wanted to use chains. It's gotten to the point now where we use snow tires, and, of course, we don't have the winters that we used to have, we don't get the snow that we used to get, and the roads and snow removal equipment are much better. Now, of course, the traffic on Route 9 and the sections out there exceed by far the amount of traffic on Squankum Road today. And now, of course, you can get to Lakewood in minutes, unless you get caught in a traffic jam on Route 9. Then you may wish that you had taken Squankum Road.    Ms. Williams: You know, it's interesting that you talk about the postal delivery, because your son, Jim, is involved in the postal system. So maybe he might want to reflect on that.    Jim Lang: Well, just to add onto what Dad just talked about, I was a part-time letter carrier in the Brielle post office in 1973. Brielle post office was and is still a very small office, and the likelihood at that time of advancing anytime soon from a part-timer to a regular employee was very low. There was a fellow ahead of me who did not become a regular employee until almost fifteen years after he was first employed because new regular positions just were not available. I had heard in the late fall of 1973 that they were going to open a Howell post office in the coming year. Since Howell was growing, besides moving my job to my own hometown, I would greatly improve my chances of becoming a regular employee by transferring my job to Howell. Before the June 23, 1974 opening of the Howell Post Office, Howell was delivered by Freehold Post Office in the northern section, Farmingdale Post Office in the Eastern and Central sections, and Lakewood in the southern portion of Howell Township. Adelphia, earlier known as Blue Ball, also has had a post office, but that's always been just post office boxes only and window service. There was no actual route delivery out of the Adelphia post office, nor is there even today. After an unfortunate survey was made of the public, the postal service opened the Howell post office on June 23 of 1974. I remember it well. The reason I call it unfortunate is that the survey caused a less than complete switch of service to all-Howell delivery. This decision was said to be based upon the response to a questionnaire or survey that was circulated. What happened was that the questionnaire basically asked: "Are you interested in there being a Howell post office? Would you like to be delivered by a Howell post office?" Well, the people in the Southern part of Howell were glad to have the opportunity because they were sick of writing Lakewood, New Jersey on their mail and knowing they were paying their taxes to Howell, and their emergency services came out of Howell, and they lived in Howell. A lot of people in Farmingdale delivery area were a bit wishy-washy about it. They were used to being called Farmingdale, even though, like my dad said, Farmingdale is just a little island, less than a square mile, in the middle of Howell. The people in the Adelphia area and in northern Howell were pretty well aligned with Freehold. They felt that, "Well, we are really almost in Freehold anyway, so we're more a part of Freehold than Howell." What the survey did not ask was: "If there's going to be a Howell post office anyway, would you like to be part of it and part of Howell delivery? Would you like to have a Howell address if others are going to have one anyway?" I think if they had asked that question, the people of northern and central Howell would have been close to unanimous in saying yes. So while the southern part of Howell was completely redesignated as Howell mailing, and certain areas of the central part of Howell were recognized as Howell, North Howell unfortunately remained "Freehold." North Howell is still delivered by Freehold, and much of the Eastern and Central part is still delivered by Farmingdale. So, I guess there was less confusion for some people. For a while there we had the Howell Police, Howell Municipal Court, and Howell Library not in "Howell," and today we have two of Howell’s schools plus the Board of Education, the Howell High School, and Howell Road still not in "Howell." These people must still answer the question of "Where do you live?" with another question: "Do you want to visit me, or do you want to write me a letter?"    Ms. Williams: That's great, yes. Well that explains a little bit why we get some confusion in the 4-H office, people who live in Farmingdale and Howell. Now that explains a little bit more why people say that they live one place, but mail me a letter somewhere else. What about the fire companies, how are they allocated here? Are there Howell and Farmingdale volunteer fire companies?    Ed Lang: You can talk about that. Farmingdale is an independent.    Jim Lang: Well, yes. The Adelphia Fire Company and the Southard Fire Company were established in the twenties and the thirties respectively. And that's Farmingdale's fire siren you can hear blowing right now in the background if that microphone can pick it up. And those three companies alone, Farmingdale from about the teens, and Adelphia from the 1920s, and Southard from the 1930s protected the whole sixty-four square miles of Howell Township. It was quite a haul for those old fire trucks to reach many parts of Howell and especially talking about some of the gravel and dirt roads that Dad was talking about riding over. During the period of 1948, 1949, and 1950, three new fire volunteer companies were started. The new people who moved into some of these areas, along with the people who had lived there all of their lives for years, felt that there was far too much exposure to fire danger. Life and property were too much at risk by their having to wait for the fire trucks to come such a long distance from either Southard, Adelphia, or Farmingdale to get to their emergency. Almost simultaneously these areas of Freewood Acres, Ramtown, and Squankum started to have meetings among the most interested local citizens of each area. Among these volunteers was, of course, my father, who is a charter member of the Camp Houseman Fire Company Incorporated (which in 1954 legally changed its name on the incorporation papers to the name Squankum Fire Company Inc.) My wife Judy’s father, Alfred Kleban, was a charter member of the Freewood Acres Fire Company Inc. Freewood Acres is the area north of Southard along the Route 9 corridor. It got Howell’s first housing development, which was built by Richard Windler in the area surrounding the northern end of Windler Road. Windler started building and selling houses in 1947, the year that I was born. The area was known as Freewood Acres and the new Fire Company took the same name. Alfred had purchased a home on Helen Avenue and moved there with his family in 1948. Judy was born in 1952. Southeastern Howell in the area once known as Brushy Neck started the Ramtown Fire Company Inc. This was also around the time of Ramtown’s first housing development. Of the three, Squankum was the only one that did not have a housing development going up, so it remained the most rural and is the most rural even to this day. Dad is the last living charter member that we know of, definitely the last one that's still active today, still attending the fire meetings and drills after fifty years. Squankum Fire Company was aided in its establishment by, I don't want to use words that are going to offend anybody, but you could say a few disaffected Farmingdale Fire Dept. members. These were fire department members who, at the time, decided to help some local Squankum people to establish a Squankum fire company, and they became members themselves for a short time. I don't know what their motives were, of course, but they were members long enough, at least, to get us established as a Squankum fire company. I believe that they were then given an ultimatum by the remaining members in Farmingdale to either remain a member of the new fire company or of the old department but not both.    Ed Lang: When, the Camp Houseman Fire Company started in 1949, and then when we changed the name in 1954 to Squankum Fire Company, we did not have a fire house. Instead we started over at the old Boy Scout camp off of Hurley Pond Road which is now state parkland. We started there and we had about twenty members, and it worked out pretty well.    Jim Lang: The Boy Scout camp was called Camp Houseman Boy Scout Camp and the Ranger at the Boy Scout camp: do you want to tell about him?    Ed Lang: Yes. He was one of the fellows that helped us, I just can't think of his name right now -    Jim Lang: Carl -    Ed Lang: Carl Thunnell. And he helped us to organize a fire company in the beginning and he was the Scout Master -    Jim Lang: The Scout Camp Ranger, I guess -    Ed Lang: The Scout Camp Ranger. He was in charge of the whole works over there.    Jim Lang: He was the Live-in Scout Camp Ranger.    Ed Lang: And he would record and supervise the different troops that would come down there and they'd stay in the woods. It was very nice place, and he was a very nice man to do business with. So now we still didn't have a building, but they had a building so we went over and talked to them and he said, "Okay, you can put it here for a while."    Jim Lang: First fire truck.    Ed Lang: And that was the first fire truck that we had, a 1949 Studebaker pick-up owned by the Boy Scouts. It had no top, and had single rear wheels and all we could carry on that was like five or six Indian tanks, and maybe one or two hand fire extinguishers that we could use. So this is how we started.    Jim Lang: For those who are not familiar with the fire service - Indian is a brand name of the backpack tank capable of carrying five gallons of water. It has a hand-operated pump and a hose attached that you can swing around from the side and hold in front of you. By using a pumping motion, you can direct a small stream of water at a fire. Most of them nowadays are higher tech, lighter weight, probably a little more efficient and are used now almost solely on grass and small light brush fires.    Ed Lang: So then after that we started, oh, we really got big then! We went for another truck. Now that truck that I just spoke about, we could carry roughly five Indian tanks and we had about four and five men, and that's all we could carry on that. That's it. And in the wintertime if there was any ice or snow on the ground, the wheels spun whenever we started and it was really rough going. Then we started to get into different other vehicles. We had a 1925 Ahrens-Fox. This was a true fire truck with a two or three stage piston pump capable of high such pressures. We had to be careful not to burst the hoses. We had another one that was a former fuel oil truck. This was a 1936 Dodge Brothers’ tank truck. This one carried more of the water that we needed so badly. It had a thousand-gallon tank and with the dual rear tires and extra weight, could travel under almost any conditions. But we still didn't have a firehouse of our own yet until after we left Camp Houseman in 1955.    Jim Lang: I was about seven years old then. Restrictions were much less. I can remember that when they were still at Camp Houseman I would accompany my Dad to the "Firehouse." I remember being able to look down between the joints of the floorboards (real wooden boards) of the fire truck and watch the pavement race by underneath the truck from where you would be sitting. Dad would get practice driving and checking everything out and filling the gas tank at either the Squankum Service Center, which was Chet Hayes’ gas station and welding shop or at Lou Poline’s general store, which was located at the old ending to Allaire Road (Atlantic Avenue). The store also had a gas pump.    Ed Lang: That's when we got the new name over here on Squankum. And we had to put the truck in different garages. We did not have a firehouse. Maybe it was over in this one, that one, oh, I know there were about five of them where we used to put the truck, and then we had problems: "Who do you call when you get a fire?" Then sometimes we would give certain firemen the number, but maybe they wouldn't be home. It was rough going. But after a while we got settled a little bit more. Then we built, as I say here, the firehouse in Squankum, and I think that was a three bay or -    Jim Lang: Two bays.    Ed Lang: That was two bays with a kitchen and all facilities.    Jim Lang: Uh, uh, uh, not at first.    Ed Lang: Well.    Jim Lang: It was just two bays.    Ed Lang: There was two bays and -    Jim Lang: A utility room.    Ed Lang: A utility room. So then, after a while, we had, well we had trouble with this truck or that truck, but as an example we had some old stuff. We would back the truck in the fire house and then sometimes we'd go to leave and maybe this tire was low and that tire was low, and we'd have to pump it up before we could leave. So then we got wise to ourselves, when we'd back the truck up, we put a jack under the bumper. The jack that was under the bumper took the weight off the truck tires. Then when enough weight was off of the tires they would continue to hold the air and you could get in the truck and drive off the jack and be on your way to the fire. And you'd have your air in your tires. You didn't have to look to see if you had a flat tire. So we did that for a while, and it worked pretty well. Then we'd come in, come off a fire, and we'd jack it up again and take the weight off the wheels. Now this is going back. And we had this for some time and then finally we started to get better equipment, and when we had our own firehouse with heat we no longer had to worry about trouble in freezing weather with some of the trucks freezing up. But we were always fortunate and we did pretty well, and the people were with us a lot. And we'd get this and get that, and we'd say, "Hey, we gotta get over here and work on this." And as I say, the Squankum Fire Company sure has advanced. We have practically everything that is needed, almost. Although as time goes on, there's always something else needed. We have a good group, we have a lot of them, they're all experienced now and they went to the classes and they're doing very good in the Fire Company. I think we're doing very well for what we started with. In this business with the boundary lines today, there are five companies in Howell Township plus the Boro. The way that things are organized today there are five fire districts. The six, as you know, are Adelphia, Freewood Acres, Southard, Ramtown, and Squankum and the Boro of Farmingdale. So we have our own boundary lines, we get along well, and we also have a system made up that when we get a call in the day time, two fire companies go out to ensure coverage and not be short-handed. So we give very good protection. And the fire companies do very well in getting to alarms. And we also have different procedures where our boundary lines are and we cooperate very well and we cooperate with one another, and if there's anything that comes up, we settle our little difficulties once in a while. But everything is working pretty well as far as the fire company in Squankum. Nobody gets paid for fighting fires. We are free, as far as getting this, or getting that -    Jim Lang: Volunteers.    Ed Lang: All volunteers. We do appreciate what the people do for us when we need help. The cooperation and the men are good, and it's got to the point now where the roads are good, and we're getting more hydrants in. We do have a tank that holds six thousand gallons, and whenever there is a structure fire, or a fire that's going to need heavy duty water, where there's no fire hydrants, we take that tanker. Sometimes, we take that even when there are fire hydrants because you can get to the fire immediately, you don't have to lay out a thousand feet of hose before you can get the water up there. We can make a quick fire knockdown.    Ms. Williams: You certainly have shown a lot of dedication in your own work with this, but also dedication seems to be a part of your whole family background. What about your dedication to farming in this county? Both of you have been involved in that, and that takes a lot of persistence and dedication. Do you want to talk about your history with farming in Monmouth County?    Ed Lang: I was always a farmer at heart. My father was, too. So we always had a big garden and if we didn't, sometimes we used other grounds that we would make a deal with the people, and they were only to glad that you could come in and plow up the ground and plant it. So with that there it increased the production in Monmouth County. And it was good because you couldn't always go to the store. You couldn't always go to the market easily because your main market was like Freehold and Asbury Park. Once in a while there was maybe a little road stand here and there. But as far as big stuff, you had to go to Freehold or Asbury Park. Now you know, in a lot of cases the distance was great, but today you can go anywhere and get almost the same thing quickly. In Farmingdale and in Howell Township, you have to remember, each year, as the time goes on, there are less farms and people are putting up more buildings. And the farming business is going out of New Jersey, if you ask me, it's going too fast. I'd hate to see some of these farms, fifteen, sixteen, seventy-five or a hundred acres, and less or more, being sold to developers. Let them go to a state where they need buildings. I think that New Jersey has enough of them as it is now. And on top of that, your taxes increase heavily, your schools are heavily taxed, it's big money. The impact is very unfair on the people who have been here to have the town provide service suddenly to hundreds of people. So I think if somebody wants to start a development, do us a favor, as far as I'm concerned, take it out of New Jersey and go where you like. But I think New Jersey's got enough of them now.    Ms. Williams: Do you echo that sentiment also, Jim?    Jim Lang: Well, I wouldn't exactly say echo, but I definitely understand and feel in a similar fashion about it. I think back especially to when as a kid, and I was going to school. I went to the brick Ardena School, when it was the only grammar school in Howell. It was built sometime around 1938, according to the cornerstone. On the school bus, you would mostly pass farms and a lot of them were chicken farms in Howell. There was a lot of produce grown as well. We grew lot of sweet corn and a lot of vegetables in this area. This soil was very rich and very good, especially in the northern part of the Township. When you see these developers now with their earth moving machines, they're cutting through sometimes twelve inches of top soil - big, heavy, rich top soil. Of course, they have their plans, and it's not called mining, but this top soil goes away, and when people buy their houses they end up with a couple of inches of top soil and that's their lawn. The very best soil and farmland in Monmouth County, perhaps in New Jersey, gets consumed by developers. I think a little planning to the future 30 years ago might have said, "You know, once we destroy, or change the character of our best growing ground in the county, it's going to be gone for good. "They’re not making any more of it", as Will Rogers said. Maybe, at least, they should have planned to dedicate a major portion of the poorly soiled areas to development. We should have tried to at least build on some of the ground that won't support vegetation or agriculture well anyway.    Ms. Williams: You had a pig business, you were mentioning before. How did that work?    Ed Lang: Before I get that, Jim was talking about the different things that took place here in the Squankum part of Howell Township. On the Squankum Road at the Manasquan River, the bridge was built, back in the Depression by the Civilian Conservation Corps, I remember that CCC engineers decided to put a little island in the river there sometime later. The island was like maybe, thirty foot wide, by a hundred feet long. And then they paid the CCC guys to go in there and plant shrubbery. You could row or canoe over to it and you could walk on it--until we got a heavy rain. Then the river just carried the whole island away with it. Not a trace was left. But it was nice until the first major rain.    Jim Lang: I think it's interesting  obviously some engineer in CCC or someplace thought this was a workable thing in the 1930s. Approximately forty years later, on the other side of town on the northwestern section, instead of learning from history, a developer was allowed, by hook or by crook, to build houses in the meanders of the Manasquan River. There's probably still litigation going on about this, so I won't name any names of the development or anything. People moved down here from New York and North Jersey and bought these houses, and I guess some of them must have come in the middle of the night or something or never were taught earth science in school. They could never really have looked at these houses, except to think that it was quaint to have the river so close. They did not know that the meanders of rivers occasionally overflow their banks when a river rises after a rain. The river takes a shortcut and goes through the meander. And, unfortunately, I think some of those houses even had to be purchased back by Howell Township afterwards, because they were not habitable, although the sites had been approved by engineers. I had a few thoughts when my dad was talking about the Fire Company. I don't come anywhere near the time that he's been a member, he's been a fireman for over fifty years, I've been one since I was eighteen years old and I'm fifty-two now, so that's about thirty-four years. But I did want to make a couple of observations. In Dad's fifty years he's been President of the fire company numerous times, he was Fire Chief for a couple of years, he was Assistant Chief, he was and is a Trustee, and has held quite a few other offices. He’s been Chief Engineer, keeping the trucks maintained and running for almost all of that fifty years. And he was a Fire Commissioner for -    Ed Lang: Twenty-eight years and one month.    Jim Lang: And just for people who may not be aware of how that Fire Commissioner thing is organized, as I mentioned to you, back around 1950, we finally had five fire companies in Howell. These are five non-profit, incorporated volunteer organizations. Each of them responsible at that time to raise their own money through donations, to purchase property, build a building on it, buy the fire trucks, buy the fire equipment, and put them in the fire house and keep enough heat in the place so that nothing would freeze. And this is, as you can imagine, a very tough thing to do, whether you're talking about the 1950s or today. It's an expensive thing to do. So from roughly -- well Adelphia was in the 1920s, Southard in the 1930s, through 1960, all five of these fire companies that would have at one point come into existence, were faced every year with very demanding financial needs. The volunteer members not only had to respond to all the emergencies, but also had to collect enough money from their neighbors to keep the Fire Company going. When Camp Houseman was established, of course I was only about three years old, so I don't have any specific recollections of the very first fundraising, but I probably have the advantage over Dad in the time after that. As a kid, things really impress you and stick in your mind, because they're new and fresh. And these impressions are of different proportions in a youngster’s mind than to an adult. As I said before I have some very specific recollections of Camp Houseman, of riding in a fire truck with wooden floorboards with my dad, the Chief Engineer, over macadam and more often, over the old concrete roads. These were, as I understand now, poured during the Depression. They had the washboard type of dividers for each section of concrete that was poured. I fondly remember riding along in those fire trucks with my dad. He was the chief engineer. He had to make sure the truck was running right and ready to respond to a fire. He had to make certain that everything was ready under the hood and that the fuel tank was full. I remember going to Chet Hayes's gas station in Squankum, which was called the Squankum Service Center. He was also a welder. The Fire Company had accounts with Chet Hayes and with another store, further down, which used to face on the old outlet from Allaire Road, which is also called Atlantic Avenue. At Atlantic and Squankum there used to be a blinker light and Lou Poline's Store which was called the Squankum General Store in the 1950s.    Ed Lang: Combination gasoline and eats.    Jim Lang: I can remember when the firehouse was being built in 1955. It's a concrete block structure. As a kid, this work was very impressive to me. The guys would come home from work, and they'd lay a couple courses of block, maybe before dark. In the summertime they ran little mortar mixer, a gasoline engine driven cement mixer, and they would mix little sections of the floor at one time and frame them out and pour into the forms. If you look at the old floor, even today, you can see how much of a section they could mix and pour at one time. I remember specifically they had, at that time, a really new looking truck. It was a 1942 Ford fire truck that they had bought from the town of Princeton. Princeton had bought it new and hardly used it at all. The firemen of Squankum used the tank and pump on that truck to drive the well which still tests out to have good water today at sixty-five feet. The way that they drove that well really impressed me as a kid. At that time I must have been about seven years old. They used a special nozzle that I believe that they made, attached it to the booster line hose and ran the pump. The pressure forced the water down through the center of the well casing and as the dirt would be washed out from under the well casing the well casing would lower itself into the ground. And they just kept doing that and attaching additional lengths of casing until they hit water. Then they ran a pump on that strata of water for at least, it must have been at least twenty-four hours, I know it was quite a few hours, to see how it would continue to run clear and steadily. Then they know that they had a good source. And like I said, we had the water tested even a year ago and it's still better than most of the bottled water that you buy today. I didn't understand that these things were going on as a kid of course, but I know now that they organized the fire districts in Howell in 1960. I have heard from different old timers that at one time or another almost every fire company in Howell took the opportunity to reject the proposal to organize fire districts in Howell. The way that the state law is set up, the fire district is a voting district that represents the people within that district. The taxpayers of the district pay, as part of their property tax, a fire tax. The initial establishment of fire districts where existing fire companies already exist pretty much has to be unanimous within all of the fire companies of the town or township. All the fire companies involved have to agree that they want to form into fire districts. So each of the other fire companies seemed to feel that they might be in danger of losing some autonomy in the process of establishing fire districts. To an extent this is true. Finally though, due to financial burdens, which were becoming unbearable, all five agreed, and in 1960 the fire districts were established. What is significant about this is that for the first time, no longer was one hundred percent of the monies that paid for the building and maintenance of the firehouse itself, the fire trucks, all the equipment, the fuel utilities etc coming from public donation sources. Now the burden would be shared more with all of those who benefited from the volunteers extinguishing fires and responding to emergencies. And, little by little, a larger percentage would come from property tax, the fire tax portion of property owner's property tax. A smaller percentage would come from donations. And just to give you a little insight into that, our old minutes of fire company meetings show that sometimes the members had to pass a hat around at the fire meeting. They would have to collect a few dollars so that they could put some oil in the heating oil tank so that the fire house wouldn't freeze up between meetings. They would pass the hat and collect two or three dollars or five dollars amongst the guys and buy some more heating oil.    Ed Lang: I'll interrupt for a minute right here. I remember on one occasion we had our insurance to make sure guys were covered and we had to have this insurance because you know you can always get hurt and killed or something and of course liability even then and there was no Good Samaritan laws then. This time we had the insurance bill come in to us when we were just starting. The bill was due in two weeks. Well, it got to the point where we only had some of the money. I think we needed thirteen dollars more. This was on a Friday and the insurance expired on Monday. So we passed the hat that night in the fire company and we got enough to carry on for another year. And still today I am very proud that we are all volunteer and are able to save the district money and provide the service to the town and district.    Jim Lang: I think that we should mention the impact of Cold War on Howell firefighting. The Cold War, of course, had some terrible effects on many people. You have to look hard to find a positive here. The Cold War did offer a bright spot to the volunteer fire companies of Howell Township in the fifties. This was before the time of fire pagers and home alert systems. Instead dispatching was done by a combination of audible sirens and phone chains started by the members wives who lived closest to the sirens and could hear them the best. Married women who were not strictly homemakers in those days were the exception rather than the rule. If they had jobs outside the home, that was more the exception. So they could be counted on to usually be home. And if somebody would get the phone message about a fire and get on the phone chain and several women would be calling all the rest of the firemen, "You have a fire." When the fire district was formed, suddenly there was a little bit of money to do something. Difficult decisions had to be made. Would it be money towards a new fire truck bond or a new siren or other equipment? So I remember specifically that the fire commissioners were looking to buy a used siren and they had a fellow in our fire district named Harry Mills who was in the construction business. He had a crane and a business called Mill's Crane Service. The fire commissioners were considering buying this twelve horsepower siren and hadn't figured out exactly if they would or would not buy it. Harry Mills and his brother came over with the crane and they lifted this twelve horsepower siren and they put it on the corner of the new firehouse, which as I said to you, was a new masonry firehouse. And they temporarily wired it up, and the salesman was there. Well when they turned it on, this thing shook the fire house so much that little pieces of masonry plaster started falling on our heads, and we were worried that it was going to start cracking the joints in the cement blocks. And the fire commissioners wisely decided not to buy that siren. Right after that, the Township Clerk, John R. Miller, heard about a federal program whereby all the fire companies had an opportunity to get a civil defense siren for free from the federal government. These had a pretty loud tone. It is a very characteristic twin tone. And of course the purpose of these sirens was to warn of an impending air raid from the Soviet Union. All five township fire companies got them and used them for official air raid drills that were held for a couple of years. We are still using that siren today here in Squankum for fire calls during the day. The motor has had to be rebuilt only one time in forty years.    Ed Lang: The next improvement came when we got a tavern halfway between Farmingdale and the firehouse to take our fire calls for us over the phone. It was called the Farmdale Inn. Later it was known as Kiefer’s Inn, and now and presently it is Mulligan's. The proprietor there, Joe I can’t remember his last name now, also lived there. He could take fire calls 24 hours per day. This was HIS volunteer work. We had a phone installed at the firehouse and Joe had a button at the Inn that would set off the siren at the firehouse (which the phone company charged to rent the phone line for). If Joe got the call in the middle of the night, or any time that there was a fire, he would press the button, which would blow the siren at the firehouse through the phone line and a relay. The first man to get to the fire house had to pick up the phone, dial Joe, or sometimes, I think later on they had it where Joe had dialed the fire house and he just let the phone keep ringing until the first fireman arrived at the firehouse. The first guy there would pick up the phone, Joe was on the other end, hopefully, and he would say, "The fire is at such and such." The fireman would then write it down on the blackboard and off he'd go with the crew on the fire truck. And of course it got interesting the very first time that we had rented the fire house for a small party for someone and a fire call came in. The phone was ringing, and one of the people at the party picked it up and didn't know what was going on, and shouldn't have picked it up, but didn’t know any better. After that we put a sign on the phone - Do Not Pick Up The Phone If The Siren Blows. Then, of course, as we got more modern, and as technology developed, we ended up with home alerts. These came in the 1970s after the Howell Police Department was established and the State Police barracks was closed. Personal pagers. The police had the capability of transmitting a tone that would turn on your radio and then they would speak over the radio and tell you that there was a fire call and the location. These things had a battery back up and were later made the size of a pager, which we have today.    Ms. Williams: I think anyone reading this transcript is going to have a fuller appreciation of what the fire department has gone through to be available to the public. I think it's taken for granted sometimes all that's gone into that, so we've given a very full picture of that. You had another unique experience besides the fire department: digging graves. What was that story about?    Jim Lang: What was that like in general?    Ed Lang: Oh, yes, every once in a while when I was a teenager in the early 1930s, they would, at the cemetery, ask if someone might go over and help dig a grave for this one or that one -    Jim Lang: Was that the Quaker Cemetery by Squankum Road and the Manasquan River or the one further up on Squankum?    Ed Lang: Yes, right near the Manasquan River. And that was interesting, sometimes you would dig a grave and you'd get into it and you'd have a hard job and you'd say, "Gee." You'd hit maybe pieces of iron, and maybe sometimes there would be bones in the ground. In the old days they often used wooden markers or field stone, so there was often nothing left of the markers. You would get a little funny feeling sometimes when you'd do that, but we used to help out to dig them because sometimes the people didn't have the money.    Ms. Williams: Did the families ask you, or the churches?    Ed Lang: The undertaker would take it. So everybody cooperated pretty well. There's different stories that could be told-- once we found a Civil War soldier buried in his uniform, but we replaced the earth to leave him there undisturbed -- but we're not going to go into that - that's a little deep. Also, the time of the year and the time of when we had to dig sometimes made very hard going. You never knew when you could get up to the gravesite. If there was snow on the ground, you had to clear the snow first and get in there. We almost always knew where the old graves were and we tried to make sure that there was no mistake of where the stone should have been or anything like that. The problem of an unmarked grave was due to the fact that they used fieldstone in the 1700s and the weather just wore them away.    Ms. Williams: And was this all Howell townspeople?    Ed Lang: Yes, all Howell's people.    Jim Lang: The cemetery he's talking about has been really dwarfed by time, by changes. I-195 came through Howell around 1978 I think, and what they tried to do is have the other roads be overpasses over 195. They tried to make 195 straight and as flat as they could. So there's two overpasses at Squankum and 195, you know one is northbound and the other is southbound. And these things just kind of surround this little cemetery now, go around it and so it's like skirted on all sides either by the overpasses, the ramps themselves, or 195 and of course the remains of the 1930s concrete Squankum at the Manasquan Bridge. If you don't know enough, you might not even know to look down to see this old cemetery with graves in it or the remains of the old bridge. You see the bridge was dismantled when they built the overpasses. I guess, what’s left there from the early 1700s on up, is just surrounded by the future now.    Ms. Williams: That's kind of a contrast of the old and the new.    Jim Lang: Yes. Really.    Ms. Williams: Your stories have all been so rich and bold, and I think that they've been enhanced by the fact that you've been able to talk father to son over the generations. We have about ten minutes more in our tape, and I wanted to make sure that we've had enough time to include any other stories that you might want to make sure are included.    Ed Lang: I would like to add at this time a couple minutes more, because by this time you're probably getting sick of hearing us. To begin with, when we got the first truck that had a draft, that was one major improvement. Before this we had to fill tanks either from a well pump or from a two cylinder gasoline engine driven portable pump that was hand carried by the firemen, through the mud sometimes. In other words now we would go up to the brook with the truck, and draw water from the brook through the suction made by the fire pump to fill up the truck tank. If you had enough hose (several hundred feet at least) you could now feed the water directly to the fire through the hoses. Today’s Squankum fire trucks (by contrast) carry 1000 to 1200 feet of large diameter supply hose alone on each pumper. Then, we always had to worry about clogging the suction hose strainer with mud, leaves or other debris from the pond or brook. Today most of our water supply is relayed to the pumper at the fire either from the 6000 gallon tanker that we use or from the closest available high water flow hydrant, which could be up to a mile away for a major fire like the Collingwood Auction fire. We’ve gone from using wells, cisterns, ponds, swimming pools, and brooks as our water sources to high flow pressurized hydrants or tankers.    Jim Lang: I guess the last thing I should say about any of this is there's a few people in our area who are interested in history and have probably a very rich and colorful family history of their own, including the Ira Matthews family that lives on Asbury Road. They apparently had relatives who were buried in the Revolutionary War cemetery. I know that there's a Captain Matthews buried in one Revolutionary War cemetery in town. The Matthews family has always had an appreciation for history. They were the ones that renovated the old Tennent church years ago. They restore things in the most accurate way possible, while adding to the structural strength and the integrity of the historical buildings that they work on. I know that a couple years ago they were working on a church on, I think it's on Sycamore, in Shrewsbury, or right in that area. They had to remove some rotted wooden beams and they were going to slide in and install replacement beams and they also had to do something with the steeple. While completing the work they discovered that one of the additions to the church had been built over an eighteenth century portion of the cemetery. There are no records of these graves being there. The were verified as being from the earliest era of the church and the remains were moved from under the building and laid to rest in another part of the cemetery, followed by a memorial ceremony. If anyone from this library oral history project has an opportunity to talk to members of the Matthews, including Ira Matthews Jr., and Ira Matthews III, father and son, I think you can get a wealth of information from them about the different facets of Monmouth County history. Another person that you should talk to is Isabel Kittleson, who moved from Squankum to Allenwood and still lives there today. She has some great recollections as well and lived in Squankum during some of the same periods that my father talks about. Another thing I had thought of was that, if we have time, Dad was around during the time, before and after they poured the concrete for Squankum Road and for Highway 9. I'm not clear myself which one was done first. My time in this area, my lifetime, I remember Squankum Road being concrete sections and Highway 9 was single lane concrete sections as well. So I don't know if you remember when they poured the concrete for that.    Ed Lang: I don't remember the years, but I do remember this - that Squankum Road was sometimes busier than Route 9, and I also remember, too, that after they developed Route 9, of course, that took the load off of Squankum Road. But on Squankum Road, as I mentioned before, it was common that certain times you could get stuck between here and Lakewood before they paved it because the road was so poor and the road was down as low as the brooks were. There are several little brooks going between here and Lakewood, and when you got a heavy rain it froze and the roads broke up. It was rough going. And also, when they put in the electric utilities, sometimes the electric was out for a couple of days. But anyway, we'd be out of electric for a while. This is going back when electric was new in the area. But I'll tell you this, the Squankum Road today is very busy, and of course, Route 9 is very busy. And all the roads are getting pretty heavy. And they're paved pretty well. They continue to make improvements. Farmingdale just did quite an improvement on their main street to the town. And it makes it nicer when you go in and out and the roads are better. I think it helps business a lot, and people have a better feeling towards the town when they see that the roads are halfway decent.    Ms. Williams: Well, we certainly want to thank you for giving the time to this project because your stories have really added a lot to the knowledge of Monmouth County and particularly of the post office and the fire companies, and I know the readers and listeners will really benefit from your recollections. And also particularly that you were able to speak about these as father and son, which is really a very unique and special perspective, so thank you for your time.    Jim Lang: You're welcome.    
MonmouthCounty;Dorothy Young;1909;1999;Dorothy Young, 1909, 1999                 Remembering the 20th Century: An Oral History of Monmouth County      Ms. Dorothy Young in her home in Ocean Grove, 1999  Date of Interview:  April 6, 2000  Name of Interviewer:  Ms. Rhoda Newman   Premises of Interviewer:  Ms. Young's home, Ocean Grove, NJ  Birth date of Subject:  May 3, 1909    Ms. Newman: Now you've had an extraordinary life, Ms. Young. Could you tell us something about it and how long you have been in Ocean Grove?    Ms. Young: Well, I came to Ocean Grove the first time when I was three years old. My father was a Methodist minister, in fact, he was a fifth generation Methodist minister  and we would come here for the holidays. My earliest memory of Ocean Grove was my father lifting me up at Beersheba to have a drink of water.    Ms. Newman: That's Beersheba fountain.    Ms. Young: Yes. I had a brother and two sisters: Sherman, Roberta, and Helen. We went over to a shoe store where now the Shell Beauty Salon is, and my father was getting shoes for all of us. My sisters got the proverbial Oxfords. They were Oxfords with stockings. But, I always was a little different than the family. I often thought when I was growing up, I might have been exchanged at the hospital because I was completely different in my thoughts than my sisters. I didn't want to wear Oxfords, or stockings, I wanted to wear Little Mary Janes, the socks. So, my father always complied with my wishes. I was always Daddy's little girl until the very end of his life. I remember my mother and father were going to the afternoon concert at the Convention Auditorium, and we were all dressed for dinner. My older sister, Roberta, said, "Oh, we want to stay and be down at the ocean while you go to the concert." She promised my mother that, of course, that we wouldn't get wet. As you can imagine, by the time my mother and father returned, we were soaking wet. The waves would come up higher and higher. But my parents were never one to punish us for anything like that.    Ms. Newman: Where did you live during the winters?    Ms. Young: Where my father was pastor, where ever he was. And when I was about one or two, my father acquired the Elim Cottage at 5 Main Avenue from the Association, and it was his dream to be able to have ministers and missionaries come there free for two weeks every summer. And until it was paid, he used to spend most of his retirement paying for the people who couldn't afford to pay. It was a big lovely sprawling house. Now, there are six cottages where the Elim used to be. The name Elim came from the Old Testament. If you recall, when Moses led the people out of bondage of Egypt, they took so many over fifty years and more. And one time they were destitute on the desert. No food no water, and the people were getting really very upset with Moses. And they saw this beautiful oasis in the middle of the desert with the palm trees and a spring. And, it was called The Elim, which means Haven. It was a very beautiful thought of my father, a dream of his. And later in life, I had written a book, and I was going to donate all the proceeds to The Elim, but unfortunately my father died before that materialized. The whole family would come there. My sister was married. Both of them were married. I was married. So, the whole family would spend their summers there, and it was a very, very happy time and lovely memories for me. We continued to stay at The Elim until my father died.    Ms. Newman: When did he die?    Ms. Young: He was seventy-eight when he died. He was the first one in the family to die. Many years ago, when I was a child, I used to love to go to my Auntie Norton's house, where my father had a pastorate. And, some how or other, we got out of touch with her through the years. And, one day, my father came to The Elim and said, "Guess who is down on 5 Main Avenue?" I said I didn't know. And he said, "Your Auntie Norton." So, I came up here right away and that started a wonderful, wonderful friendship. She reminisced about many things I had forgotten  sitting on her knee when I would visit, and her spaniel had to be on the other knee. And, she was the only one that I would ever visit in my childhood. And, one fall I called her. Her family hadn't helped her in praying to get close to God, and I filled in that gap for her. The last time I saw her was when she was at the Grove. But, I had promised to go up to visit her at her home in Middletown where I used to visit as a child. But somehow or other, before I went to Florida with my mother, I wasn't able to go. But as soon as I came back, I called her. A nurse, or housekeeper with her. And she said, "I'm sorry, your aunt won't be able to come to the phone. She is very, very ill." And I said, "Would you please tell her I called, and I will call again." And I hung up. Then something inner prompted me to call back. And the nurse said, "I am so thankful you called back, because she was heart broken not to be able to talk to you. Wait a minute and I will carry her to the phone." So, we had a lovely, lovely chat. Before I hung up, I prayed with her. And I said, "I will be out the first thing in the morning to see you." I went out and when I knocked on the door, Albert, her oldest son, answered and he had a dark suit on. And I said, "I'm Dorothy Young." I hadn't seen him since I was a child. I said, "I'm Dorothy Young, and I came to see your mother." And he said, "She died last night." And I said, "I talked to her yesterday and promised to come out." And he said, "I don't see how you could have because she was so very, very ill." So, later he got in touch with me and he said, "The house had so many, many happy memories. We have had so many weddings here and birthdays all through the years. It is necessary for us to sell the house because I have two daughters who are pregnant, and we will have to help with some money. So," he said, "I know my mother would hate to have this get out of the family, but I know if we have to sell it, my mother would love you to have it more than anyone." So, I gave them a check.    Ms. Newman: Were you married at the time?    Ms. Young: Yes, I was married. And my husband did not approve of my getting the house because he was used to very large spacious homes. He said, "You know I can't stand small houses. You know I can't stand low ceilings." And, it was a shame. Albert sent back $500.00 because he said we didn't have an agent. So, since my husband didn't want it, I had a little on the side. He told his lawyer about it. And he said, "Dorothy has never asked you for anything. That's the least you could do." So we bought it. There was an older man here named Doc who was working for me. He was very happy to get the work, and he and I spent a month scrapping and caulking the living room downstairs and painting it. And then when my husband saw it he said, "We'll renovate it." Well it's a pity, because our house had original hand made gingerbread. It was beautiful. I have a picture of it. So anyway, we had it all redone, and as you can see, the rooms are large, very spacious for Ocean Grove. And, then when my husband passed on in 1992, we were living in New York City, and I had to chose whether to remain there or come down here to live. And I chose Ocean Grove, and that was the best decision I had ever made in my life. I am so happy here. I belong to everything. I do charitable work. I am a member of Saint Paul's. I was on the Board of the Mental Health  at Fitkin Hospital for thirty years, until it merged with three other hospitals. And, I am an Eastern Star, and a DAR. I belong to the Women's Club, and I go faithfully to church, Saint Paul's. It is a wonderful, wonderful church. That is my story more or less of Ocean Grove, personally.    Ms. Newman: You had an unique experience in your teens. Can you tell us about that?    Ms. Young: Well, my father was a minister, and it is strange how God works in our lives. All my brother and my sisters were brilliant, brilliant students. But sometimes when father would change churches I skipped two grades, very, very important grades, the second, and the sixth. Since I was the last of the family, somehow or another, they didn't help me make up the work, so therefore, I didn't enjoy school. I did the eight grades in the six years, and the high school in three. Even though I really wasn't good at school and did not enjoy it, I was going to Beaver College Prep School.    Ms. Newman: Which high school did you graduate from?    Ms. Young: Beaver, Pennsylvania. I went to Beaver for a semester. It was necessary for us to go to a concert for up to four credits, and I saw the great Anna Pavlova, Russian ballet dancer, and I knew then, I had to be a ballet dancer. And my father, as I said, I was very close to him, and I guess he understood the plight. And at that time in my life, my father was retired, and really couldn't afford to send me to ballet school, and my grades weren't good enough to have any help from the college. But when I saw Anna Pavlova, and told my father I had to be a dancer, he arranged for me to take ballet lessons. I never was a ballerina, but I took ballet and knew ballet. My father always believed that children should work in the summer to help pay for their college. I was too young to work, so I took ballet lessons at a place called Ned Wafturn in New York. It's funny, in one of my interviews, this is many, many years ago, I mentioned him in my interview, and he wrote me, sending a wire. It said, "Thank you so much for remembering me." So, my father would take us all to New York to check us in at the YWCA, called Laura Spellman, down I think on 12th or 13th Street. And, he got the girls jobs at General Electric, which was around the corner, and I would take my lessons. Well, I would look at Variety, and when I was sixteen, I answered a call at Earl Carroll Vanities. He was the one who took the place of Ziegfeld, and I went and was chosen with the girls, and we went up on the roof and took movies. There are pictures of us dancing and Earl Carroll signing up pictures of six of the beauties. When my father came to take us home, I told him about this, and he said, "No way, no way." So, I went back to Beaver. Then, the next year when we went, I answered another ad in Variety. And it said, "Girl dancer wanted for Broadway show and tour of the United States." Well, I went. That surprised me because, I was sort of a timid little girl.    Ms. Newman: And you were how old at this point?      Dorothy Young  Ms. Young: Seventeen. And, I went to the Longacre Theatre up at 48th Street and Broadway, and when I arrived the stage was full of girls auditioning. I saw two men down in the Orchestra viewing the audition. I had no idea who they were. One was Houdini and the other was his manager, Mr. Smith.  I was about the last one to audition. I did a Charleston. And they chose me right away and took me over to their lawyer over on 44th Street. I called Mrs. Houdini "Mrs. H." Sometimes an interviewer would say to me, "When you are so close, why do you call her Mrs. H?" I said a seventeen year old girl is not about to call a mature woman by her first name. So, she was always Mrs. H. to me. She took me over to choose material to make my outfit, my costume, and then I signed the contract. I dashed to my father and said, "I'm going to dance on Broadway," and he said, "No way."  I went to Houdini. They must have been flabbergasted because they were to open in one week, and they had gone through these auditions. Anyway, I told them my father and mother wouldn't allow me to. They asked to speak to them, and they convinced my parents that they would look after me as their very own daughter, which they did. It was a wonderful, wonderful year. Mrs. H. was a second mother to me. She taught me how to sew and put on makeup. We spent our days together. I've done five documentaries about Houdini. One thing they never put in is that I say Houdini was a very kind, compassionate man. They liked to picture him as egotistical and temperamental. And, my year with them was really, really wonderful. Another thing they never put in: he had been famous for about thirty years, but his dream, his project dream was to always star in his own production on Broadway, and this was his dream come true. Well, we opened, and my father arranged for me to live with a widow with two daughters for the week I would be in New York, before leaving to break in the show at Hartford, Connecticut. And, one of the daughters said, "Oh I'm going to a party tonight, and would you like to go?" I said, "Surely." I remember it was the day I had my costume fitted up at 103rd Street at Houdini's home.    Ms. Newman: Can you describe the costume?    Ms. Young: Oh, I have pictures of them. They were very, very scanty. I'll show you a picture of them later. And, Mrs. H., who was a wonderful designer, always made all of hers.    Ms. Newman: Where they silk? And what colors?    Ms. Young: Oh, beautiful bouquets and metallic. So, after I had my costume fitted, I jumped in a taxi at 103rd Street. A young girl and I went down to The Village where the party was to be. The girl introduced me around. We danced in a club. I met this man. He seemed very, very sophisticated to me. I guess he was around thirty. He said, "Oh you are so young to be in New York all by yourself. You need a big brother to take care of you." I didn't care for him. So, he was smart enough not to ask for my phone number, but he asked the girl I was staying with for her phone number. And he called up the next day and took us both to lunch. For the whole week, he took me to all the best places in New York City. And during the whole year I was with Houdini, he called me once a week. On the way to Hartford, I still didn't know who Houdini was. They had a drawing room and I had the parlor. Houdini came out with a deck of cards and he did all of his card tricks for me. And then he proceeded to tell me a lot about his childhood, which was very interesting. Well, when we arrived at Hartford, it was on a Sunday night. And Rachmaninoff had a concert there, and we went directly to the theatre to unpack. I remember I stood in the wings and listened. And I was so thrilled. And when he came out, I guess he wondered why a young girl like that would just be standing there listening the whole time. It is a very happy memory having had a visit with Rachmaninoff. He was very tall and slender. I remember when he said goodbye, he patted my head. After I fulfilled my year contract, of course, Houdini wanted me to stay on.    Ms. Newman: What did you do as part of the Houdini act?    Ms. Young: At first they had a very beautiful curtain made of mementos of things they had been given in Europe, and this curtain was very beautiful. Mrs. H. was dressed as Marie Antoinette, and I her escort. Mrs. H came out on one side and I the other. We joined in the center and did a little minuet, and pulled back the curtains. Then a big stage was there, and a black back drop and Houdini came out in his magnificent entrance. Two years ago, Harvey Cartel, an actor, I didn't know who he was, he was doing an impersonation of Houdini, and he sent his limo down for me to go up and have dinner with him, and I did Houdini's entrance for him about twenty times, and he studied the mannerisms. Houdini was not a tall man. He was very muscular, and the way he carried himself, you didn't think of height. He was dressed in full dress, immaculate. And the jacket was designed that he could remove the sleeves from the elbow down so that while he worked, you could see that he wasn't concealing anything. Well, the show opened with the proverbial magic thing with the scarves and the birds and all that. Then Mrs. H. had her famous, famous trunk trick. It's now called "Metamorphosis." Houdini purchased it when they were young in Coney Island for $25.00 from a retiring magician, and now that has become so famous. And Mrs. H. must have been almost, I bet she was, no she must have been at least fifty or fifty-two, but from the back of the stage she looked like sixteen, the way she was made up in her little gown. She kept herself beautiful. My first number was a Radio Girl. Collins and Vickory, his two assistances, would bring out a large table.  Houdini would go in back and show nothing underneath the table, no mirrors or anything like that. Then Collins and Vickory would bring out a big radio. And Houdini would open the doors, would prop them back and show there was nothing inside. He'd lift out a panel like tubes and things. Then he would close it up and tune in like, for instance, Pittsburgh would be KDKA, and it's say, "KDKA, Ms. Dorothy Young doing the Charleston." And, that was my cue to put my foot out, then the other foot, then I'd kick them together, jump up and do a curtsey.    Ms. Newman: You were inside the radio?    Ms. Young: Yes. Then Houdini would take me by the waist and lift me down, and I would go into a Charleston. And, my other number was called the "Slave Girl." The big stage was empty and there was just a pole in the middle of the big stage. And Collins would bring me out with my hands tied behind me. And I had a little skimpy burlap costume. And, Houdini would say, she has been a naughty girl, so I have to tie her up. So they tied me up to the pole from my throat down to my ankles. And then Houdini said, she has been naughty, so we will have to put her in darkness. He would press a button, and the curtain would fall to the floor. And I would come out in a beautiful butterfly costume on my toes and do a ballet number. And then another number I did: there was a big cabinet, and Houdini would walk through it and turn it around to show it was absolutely empty. Then, he would say presto, and Mrs. H. in a very beautiful elaborate costume, and myself, and Julia, his secretary, in an elaborate costume, and Kosher, in an elaborate costume, would all came out. And once in a while when Mr. Smith's wife would be there, we would add her to it. And, then the very, very exciting thing was Water Torture Cell. I think it was sad the way they made the movie about him dying in the water. The whole movie was terrible. Houdini would turn over in his grave. It was terrible. Well, Mrs. H. always stood in the wings. They had this large cabinet and Houdini would come out in swim trunks. They'd lift him up by his feet and lower him head first with his hands tied behind him and lower him in the tank. And then, to make it more dramatic, the orchestra would play, "Asleep In the Deep," which made it very dramatic. I stood with Mrs. H. often, and she said only once in their life, did he have to give the signal to be taken out. And, when I appeared at any magicians' conventions they always want to know what the secret was, of course. I would tell them I was sworn to secrecy.    Ms. Newman: You were aware of the secret, but were sworn to secrecy?    Ms. Young: Yes. The last half of his act was devoted completely to exposing spiritualism. He felt spiritualism was wicked  it preyed on poor people who'd spend their last dollar to hear the voice of their loved ones. And, he had a person we called the Reva woman who would visit the entire spiritualist, the mediums, and card people in the city before we would play. And then she would come to report to Houdini. We never could eat dinner before the show because we had to be as thin as possible. So, we always, Mrs. H., Kosher, and Julia, and Mr. Smith, Houdini, and I always had dinner after the show. And, in all those years, I never remember once Houdini showing any anger or anything. Mrs. H. was a real cut up. She was a lot of fun, and she, when we were playing Buffalo, she suggested that we go to rent a limo and go over to Canada. We went through the Mist and everything.    Ms. Newman: Niagara Falls?    Ms. Young: Yes. She was a lot of fun. And just before we left the border, she said, "Let's get a bottle of liquor and see if we could smuggle it in." Well, that night at dinner, somehow we joked about it.    Ms. Newman: This was during prohibition?    Ms. Young: Oh yes, and Houdini snapped, "Do you realized the publicity we would have had if they had caught you bringing liquor in?" And that is the only time I ever heard him express anger. He was just the most wonderful compassionate person to work for. The last act involved a very famous medium called Marjorie. He dressed up, he put on a wig and a cane, and dressed up as an old man, and went to Marjorie and told them to get in touch with the spirit of a loved one. And he copied her séance completely in the last act of the show. He would ask people to come up who would invariably be interested in spiritualism. And, they would sit at a table, and they would ask to speak with a loved one. And then, Houdini would go through the seance, and it really was weird to see. And then after he did it, he broke it apart to show the whole audience how it was done.    Ms. Newman: He would show that it was a fraud.    Ms. Young: Yes. Houdini was like a father to me, but never personal, you know. Before I left the show he said to me, "Dorothy, did you ever wonder why you were chosen over 200 girls?" I said, "No." He said, "Mr. Smith and I are opposite personalities, and you appealed to both of us. And we knew you were the one that we wanted." As I look back, I think it might have been in the first place all of those girls were typical Broadway girls, and they weren't going to have someone like that travel with them closely. It was a close unit. That is one thing, and the other thing, I was shorter than Houdini, and most of them were taller. That was my experience with Houdini.    Ms. Newman: So you had a year's contract and that was the end?    Ms. Young: Yes. And he died two months after. Two young boys were visiting him backstage. They had seen the show, and Houdini had had a pain and the doctor didn't diagnosis it right. His appendix was in the center rather than at the side. He had appendicitis, but the doctors didn't diagnose it that way. And then, one of the boys said, "You mean you could withstand a punch with all my might?" And Houdini said, "Yes." What the boy didn't realize was that Houdini had to prepare himself first, and the boy struck him, and his appendix burst. So, they rushed him to the hospital, but it was too late. He fought for a whole week. He thought he could lick it, but he couldn't, and finally he had to give up.    Ms. Newman: Did your father ever see you perform?    Ms. Young: Oh, yes, when we were in Pittsburgh, my father was in the audience, and Houdini asked him to stand up. And when I was in Chicago, my Grandmother Caldwell was there, and we were sold out. I don't know. Somehow or another, he got her a seat in the first row center. And when I took her back stage to meet Houdini, Houdini kissed her forehead and said, "Now I know where Dorothy gets her charm." (Laughs)    Ms. Newman: He does sound like a dear man. Were there other people traveling?    Ms. Young: No. We were a close unit. Collins was his main assistant, and Victory was his helper. Mrs. H., Houdini, Julia, Kosher, Mr. Smith, and I. That was our entourage.    Ms. Newman: And you went across the country.    Ms. Young: Oh, yes. And we played Broadway twice.    Ms. Newman: Were these one night stands?    Ms. Young: Oh, no, I think we played Chicago four weeks.    Ms. Newman: And you traveled by train?    Ms. Young: Yes, by train. I'd spend my day with Mrs. H. I don't remember what salary I had, but it must have been plenty, because I always stayed right in the next room to them, and I always had my breakfast sent in my room and I felt so sophisticated. I remember I had a black satin negligee with white marabous. And in those days, eating breakfast for one, they would wheel it in on a whole table. Now days if you had breakfast for one, they'd just bring it on a tray. I remember I would drape myself and feel so grown up.    Ms. Newman: What year was this?    Ms. Young: 1925 and 1926. So, that was my story with Houdini.    Ms. Newman: Was it a let down to come back?    Ms. Young: Well no, this Robert Perkins kept calling me all year.    Ms. Newman: The man you met down in the Village.    Ms. Young: I didn't want to get married because I wanted a career. But he kept at me and kept at me and convinced me I was in love with him. I was, I guess, and then I married him. My brothers came in. My father was in Florida, so my brother came in. He was a professor at Drew University, and he came in and married us.    Ms. Newman: That was right after you got back?    Ms. Young: Yes, and we lived in the very lovely, brand-new 5th Avenue Hotel.    Ms. Newman: Oh, yes, I know it.    Ms. Young: Then we'd spend our summer and naturally my son was conceived there. Mr. Perkins was with the FBI, and it was a very, very hectic year for me because he was transferred from one place to another. Since I was pregnant, he asked my sister Helen if she would take a sabbatical year and be with me. And we would no sooner be at one place than he would be transferred to another. And I remember the very last time. It was the beginning of the ninth month. He was in Florida and thought he was going to be there for awhile. I had had a very hectic time the whole time of pregnancy. I remember my doctor said, "If you go, you must stay." Two weeks and he was transferred back, and so Helen and I came back and we were in New York and we were going to the theatre and we were hailing a taxi. And we took a taxi, and we were in an accident. Helen called the doctor right a way. And the doctor said, "Take her on down to the Infirmary." So, I had a very, very, bad time. I almost died. And he almost died. It was very traumatic.    Ms. Newman: Was this the New York Women's Infirmary?    Ms. Young: Yes. I had a woman doctor. My father got her. I think if he hadn't gotten a woman doctor, I would have had it without a doctor. So, anyway, at that time, it was time to come down to The Elim.     Ms. Newman: So the baby was born in New York and he was healthy?    Ms. Young: Well, yes. I mean he gained his birth weight in due time. He was a skinny little thing.    Ms. Newman: So was he premature?    Ms. Young: Yes. I had a caesarean. I almost died. And, I had to have transfusions and everything. And I didn't know how sick I was, but I remember my father kissing me good night at the hospital, and I had forgotten what he said. But anyway, during the night, I went through what they call, "The Valley of the Shadow of Death." I can remember it as though it was yesterday. Anyway, I pulled through. I was not well, and I guess not happy. My father had befriended a very famous actor named Richard Bennett. He was very famous, but then his daughters, Constance and Joan, became more famous. He was down visiting us. The doctor said, "You know, it would be good for you to work." I had never worked in anything outside of show business. So, the doctor said it would be good if I had something to do to get my mind off my problems. Mr. Bennett said, "Well, I'm booking, casting for my show to be opened in September, and there is a part in it for Dots." He called me Dots. So, I went. Bob was very generous. He made a lot of money. He knew Andrew Mellon's secretary. Kentuckians stay together sort of like Texans. And, this man's name was Mr. Sicksmith. He used to give Mr. Perkins tips on the stock market, so he was very successful in the stock market, and he was very, very generous to me. So, I bought a house in Allenhurst with my mother. It was ideal, because I couldn't have done it without my mother. Father had retired on a very small pension, and he really always used the pension. Otherwise, I couldn't have done it because I wouldn't have left my son with anyone outside of my family.  I had a nice part to play in Jarnegan. It was also at the Longacre Theatres.    Ms. Newman: So you have the theatre in your blood by that time?    Ms. Young: Yes, by that time. And I did a lot of work in the daytime doing modeling, and doubling to earn extra money. I doubled for Gloria Swanson's legs. There was a picture, Peter Pan, and Betty Bronson was the star. And, she had a beautiful tiny little figure and she wore boots, but her ankles were bad. So, I did doubling for the ankles. I remember going to a trunk and getting things out. At the time, Gloria Swanson was the big, big star. She had just married The Marque, and they were showing them around. And I remember there was a big, big ball scene downstairs, and they just walked through. But when they came to the room where I was, they stayed quite a while and we chatted. It was very nice.    Ms. Newman: And your husband kept on traveling?    Ms. Young: Yes, he kept on traveling. The marriage never really had a chance. He died of cirrhosis of the liver. And in the meantime, I didn't want to go on the road with the show when it left in January, because of Bob, my baby, and so, they were having a big farewell dinner on the stage, catered you know. At the time when dance teams were very popular, only they were very Spanish. They were always Spanish. Mr. Bennett said, "It's funny. Dots has known me all her life, and she still calls me Mr. Bennett. And people know me ten minutes and they call me Dick." But, I always did, since very young. I had invited a friend, Mildred Miller, and she brought her date, and also an extra man. His name was Gilbert Kiamie. And, Mr. Bennett said, "You two would make an unusual dance team, you're opposites. And no one is like that." So, we tried and, it was good. He was a playboy. In the meantime, there was a manhole, and I stepped in the manhole and tore a ligament in my leg, and got water on my knee, and the other. And as I said, I still wasn't strong. The doctor said, "You know, if you could afford to go to a warm climate, it would do you good." So, Bob was all for it, and so my mother, baby, and I went down to Florida. And I spent the winter there. And, when I came back, I was having a hat made at 57th Street and 6th Avenue. When I came out, I ran into Gilbert. I hadn't gotten in touch with him the whole time. He was the son of a what is called the Silk King. His father was very, very wealthy. His father had just died, in Europe. They were all inexperienced because in Lebanese, one man always ruled over a business. So, none of them really knew much about it, so the bank came and asked for the payment. They didn't have it, so they asked for the mortgage, took it and confiscated the busness. It was thirty years before it was settled. The only thing out of it came the Kiamie Lien Law of New York State, which means, you cannot evict the person without the proper procedure. He had been brought up a wealthy family, and he was spoiled, good looking, and the women flocked around him. So, I didn't contact him. But when I came back, as I said, I came out of the hat shop, and there he just happened to be. So, we started rehearsing again. We had very good choreographers and orchestration. We worked very, very hard and became very, very successful.    Ms. Newman: What was your stage name?    Ms. Young: Dorothy and Gilbert. We made a big success.     Ms. Newman: Did you specialize in a certain kind of dancing?    Ms. Young: Oh, yes, a beautiful style, not like you see on television now. It was very beautiful. It had a ballet foundation. Very beautiful, artistic, nice. It was sort of like the Fred Astaire type. My gowns were gorgeous. The War was on and Gilbert knew he would be drafted, so he decided to enlist. And, so he was stationed here. First he went to boot camp and everything. And I had never worked except in the theater. I got a job at Fort Monmouth. I didn't know how to make a resume or anything, and anyway, I got the lowest salary. I got a job in crystals. I had to learn to cut the crystal on the XYZ axis, like a diamond. Gilbert was down at Camp Edison, but I happened to know a Colonel at Fort Monmouth, so he got Gilbert transferred to Fort Monmouth. And, Gilbert had a citation selling the most War Bonds of any person in the United States. I remember I didn't like cutting the crystals. I wore a lab coat and everything. So somehow I got the Army bus and went up to Red Bank. They had the headquarters there. God was with me again. I went to the Army Navy Headquarters. It was the creme d' la creme of Army, the Services. And luckily, the personnel man liked me very much and he arranged for me to have equivalent of a college degree through my extensive traveling, and I was able to take two courses. I took them when Rutgers would send their professors down twice a week. I took a course in electrical engineering, of all things, and I liked it so much. I took a course in Personnel Management. I liked that very much. But then I was assigned to shock absorbers. And, I have a friend, very active in the Houdini thing. He said, "Dorothy, all the things that you've done!" I wrote specifications for the shock absorbers of the Army, Navy, and Air Force. When I would go to the big meetings, of course, I would have a General on one side, and something on the other. And, I only knew my project. I had my book, you know, and I had my project. Of course, they knew everything. But, I remember Gilbert never wanted anything more than a Corporal. He didn't want to go to Officer's Training. He was able to have his own hut. He became friendly with the general's wife. He'd have breakfast over there. Anyway, he was able to have his own hut. When he called for me one time, someone said, "You going out with a corporal?" I said, "Yes, but you don't know this corporal." And, so, anyway it was a year before he was what you called separated from the Army. We got married.    Ms. Newman: What year was that?    Ms. Young: 1945. We had an apartment at Twin Gates in Red Bank. We stayed there and I continued working until he was separated from the Army. And, then we moved up to Pelham Manor. And in the meantime, his uncle had died and left him a lot of money, he and his three brothers. He asked, "Should we put it in a string of dancing schools? (which were popular then) or in the family business?" Of course, I would have just enjoyed the dancing schools, but I knew it wouldn't make a man of him. It would be the worst thing on earth. So, he put it in the family business.    Ms. Newman: This is the silk business?    Ms. Young: Yes, silk lingerie, and real estate. And this brother was very jealous of Gilbert. He was a very good-looking fellow, the brother, but he was short and stocky, and Gilbert was tall and handsome. He had another brother, Sam, but Fred never would like them do anything. He wanted to make all the decisions like the father had done. But Gilbert would spend his time at the stockbroker and learn as much as he could and all that. And Fred was doing very wonderfully, amazing in real estate. They had closed the lingerie business and the lawyer came. It was such a big thing, that lawyer. They had a lawyer all the time on the premise. I remember he only had $2,000.00 or $3,000.00 when he came to the firm. But some how or other, Fred finagled into one of the best buildings as a Logan Park owner. Well, he was reported.    Ms. Newman: Where was the building?    Ms. Young: Oh, the buildings were 95 Madison Avenue.    Ms. Newman: Oh, in New York City.    Ms. Young: In the meantime, they had eleven buildings, big, big buildings. Very, very successful. And so someone reported Fred to the FBI and the IRS, internal revenue, and anyway, he ended up in the Country Club of Jails up in Westchester. But in the meantime, this lawyer thought those two nincompoops, the playboy and the other one, wouldn't be able to do anything, and he would take it from under their feet. But instead, Gilbert had grown into an astute businessman, and Gilbert proudly showed the check. He bought Marvin out for one million dollars, when a million was a lot of money. And Gilbert became Chairman, President, and Executive at Large. And, worked very hard. I was very, very proud of him. We lived up in Pelham Manor.    Ms. Newman: Was your son from your first marriage with you?    Ms. Young: He was attending University of Virginia after the war.    Ms. Newman: And your parents?    Ms. Young: My parents lived most of the time in Palm Beach. And, my father was able to buy a place there through a very good friend and gave it to them for practically nothing.    Ms. Newman: And your son, Bob?    Ms. Young: And my son, Bob, was always so very, very close. I went through so much to have him, I guess had almost an abnormal love for him. He went to school in Allenhurst, and graduated from high school when he was sixteen. They promised the mothers that if the mothers would sign for the boys when they were seventeen, they wouldn't send them overseas. He was in college at sixteen, and his birthday was in December 26. And, all the boys were in the services. So you'd think the world would come to an end if he didn't get in. So, I told him, if he would finish one semester at Rutgers, be a full-fledged fraternity man with good grades, that I would sign for him. Well, they promised the parents they wouldn't go over seas until they were eighteen. And you know, he was in boot camp for six weeks instead of eight and he was shipped over to the Philippines in the middle of the big push. You can imagine how hard that was on me. So, I never thought of marrying Gilbert because number one he was a playboy, number two, he didn't care for children. And I didn't want him to have any jurisdiction over Bob. So, during the War, I lived with Helen on Rumson Road, and she was principal of the school, Sea Bright School. And she was well loved and one-in-a-million principal. She helped. In the summer time, Seabright is an affluent community, but in the winter, it is full of divorced people and drunkards, and what not. They loved Helen very, very much. Bob and I lived with them until he went into the Navy. And it was hard worrying about him. It was terrible him being over there in the Philippines. They talked about Hiroshima. Well, if it hadn't been for that, I wouldn't have a son. Another young boy and Bob had signed up to go into Japan, and they would never have come back.    Ms. Newman: So he saw combat in the Pacific?    Ms. Young: Yes, in the Navy. So I received a letter from Bob, and I still have it, when he wrote, "Mother, you're always thinking of other people. And if you think you want to marry Gilbert, I want you to marry him." So, I married Gilbert while he was in the Army. And we lived in Pelham, and he would commute. Anyway we were married for forty-nine years.    Ms. Newman: So it lasted?    Ms. Young: Yes, it lasted.    Ms. Newman: Now, did you have any further theatrical experience?    Ms. Young: Just after my dancing, no. Oh, well, God works in my life every time. When we moved to Pelham, Gilbert was engrossed in his business. A friend said to me, "I am going up to take an art lesson from a wonderful French woman. Why don't you come with me?" So, I went and I started taking lessons, and I took lessons straight for fifteen years.    Ms. Newman: Were these painting lessons?    Ms. Young: Yes. All of this work here is my art. She had a very professional studio with lights and everything. And people who knew me, all of her students, would come back and ask me questions if she was busy. The teacher asked me if I would join her and own half of the studio. And I said, "No, I'm married, and I just want to paint when I can." Well, I painted, as I said, four days a week for forty years, no thirty. I became one of the Fifty American Artists, which was a prestigious group. Winston Churchill and Eisenhower were honorary members. And you had to paint at a certain price and get a certain price for certain quality in order to show. And this person, Margaret McDonald Phillips, who was president said, "Dorothy, you're ready to be launched in a big way. I will do it at cost because it will be good for the Fifty American Artists." So I told Gilbert, and he said he wouldn't do it. It was such a measly two thousand dollars, and he wouldn't do it. And still he was so proud. And he was proud of the DAR, and proud of my painting. People say he was proud of me, but he didn't want me to be too big.    Ms. Newman: He didn't want you to be a star.    Ms. Young: So, then I was, just sort of. The irony of it, I met Nathan Strause, who was Housing Administrator under Roosevelt, who was on one of our trips once, and he loved my dancing. And then I was going to New York to meet Gilbert for dinner. We went to all the best places all the time, you know, and I won't go into the other side. And, then I was going downtown to have dinner with Gilbert, and Nathan Strause was on the train. I saw him, but I went two aisles further. He saw me and he came up and sat. And he said, "What have you been doing?" And I said, "Art and so on." And he said, "When you are ready to be launched, let me know." But you know what that meant. So I never did anything about it. After I decided to be here, it was the best decision I ever made.    Ms. Newman: When did you come back to Ocean Grove?    Ms. Young: When Gilbert passed on in 1992.    Ms. Newman: Is Bob in the area? Do you see him?    Ms. Young: Bob was a vice president of Young and Rubicon Advertising Agency, and he became very successful. We are very close.    Ms. Newman: Now does he enjoy Ocean Grove with you?    Ms. Young: Oh, yes. He lives with me six months of the year and he lives in Florida the other six months.  All of my four grandchildren and my eight great grandchildren love Ocean Grove. This is home to them.    Ms. Newman: Well you certainly have had a very remarkable life with so much creativity in so many areas.    Ms. Young: Yes, it has been a very full, happy life.    Ms. Newman: Well thank you, thank you very, very much. I really appreciate it.    Ms. Young: It was a pleasure.          
MonmouthCounty;Donald D. Warner;1933;2000;Donald D. Warner, 1933, 2000        Remembering The 20th Century: An Oral History of Monmouth County      Donald D. Warner, present day  Date of Interview: August 31, 2000  Name of Interviewer: June West  Premises of Interview: Monmouth County Library Eastern Branch, Shrewsbury, NJ  Birthdate of Subject: March 1, 1933    Ms. West: Hello, Dr. Warner. Thank you very much for participating in our oral history project. First of all, can you tell us where you are from?    Mr. Warner: I am glad to be here, thank you. I am from Crestmont, Pennsylvania, an interesting small town on the outskirts north of Philadelphia. Interesting in that there are, I guess, approximately three thousand citizens. The largest municipality there is called Abington Township, which is a very wealthy district. Crestmont itself was primarily an African American community. We had one Italian family living in the community  one of the children was one of my boyhood friends. I remember the name specifically, but I won't mention it.    Ms. West: Okay, please continue.    Mr. Warner: I was born one of eight children and I would be number five actually. My mother was from Newport News, Virginia, and my father was born in Hatboro, Pennsylvania. My mother and most of her family members are very well educated persons from Newport News. My father only went through grade three. During most of my life he was never employed. Most of the men in Crestmont worked at odd jobs, except in times when the WPA and several other federally sponsored governmental programs were in vogue during my early years.    Ms. West: Would you tell us what the WPA stands for?    Mr. Warner: Works Progress Administration. That was a program that came out of the early governmental area along with the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) camps etc., that were utilized to hire youth. During that particular time, I was never part of that because I was too young. But, what's very interesting in the hometown is that it was very difficult for African American men to find jobs. Most of our mothers worked as domestics, even though my mother, along with many others, was well educated. She spent all of her life working for wealthy women and families in the greater Abington area taking in washing and ironing, scrubbing floors, and the like. And on weekends other persons from the Abington area would bring in their washing and ironing to be done in our home also. I attended the Park Elementary School which was ninety-nine percent African American, with the exception of the one family that I mentioned earlier. In Park Elementary School I was a very, very good student. It was very interesting that upon entering junior high school, I found out that as good as I was, I dropped from an A student to immediately becoming a C and D student, based on the information I had acquired. One of the things I had to do was to learn how to read and write at the level of other students. The junior high school  was an integrated high school, and many of the students there were from the wealthy areas of Ridal, Pennsylvania, Abington, Pennsylvania. I learned to write by copying from a girl named Joy who sat in front of me in most of my classes, and she wrote very beautifully, with large circular letters.  I just copied her writing and learned to write that way. It was very interesting: in elementary school, where my grades were very, very good, I would, on report card day,  have to run home, because other students would want to beat me up, simply because my grades were that good. And then to go from that atmosphere to a junior high school where one's grades evidently were not good enough, based on the learning that I had acquired, but also based on what I believed happens to be some sophistications of racism in America about expectations for young Black men at that time, which continues even today in some sophisticated areas. I graduated from junior high school and attended Abington Senior High School. The graduating classes were very small during that time  there may have been one hundred and fifty students graduating from prestigious Abington High School. After Abington High School, I was employed by Strawbridge and Clothier as a stock boy for a short period of time. Then I was employed by a building contractor. From there I joined the United States Marine Corps. In 1951, as an enlistee, I saw service in Korea on front lines. I returned from Korea, met a sailor in Portsmouth, Virginia and asked him if he knew of any colleges that I could attend in Pennsylvania. He directed me to Temple University. I attended Temple University from 1954 to 1958. My mission there was interesting in that I talked to the bursar and asked if I could take an entrance examination. They allowed me to take an examination, and I entered Temple University.    Ms. West: Let's regress a little to your youth before we get too far on.  You say that you were a good student  did you do a lot of reading then as a youngster?    Mr. Warner: I read primarily for school, and outside readings were slim because there were always a lot of chores to be done. These were considered manly chores at the time:  white washing fences and white washing rocks, cleaning the yard and  the outhouse, things that we don't have to do today, thank goodness.    Ms. West: Thank goodness is right!    Mr. Warner: But there were loads of chores. We also picked coal on the tracks for warmth during the winters. We grew a very large garden, and one of the things my father would do was to trade vegetables for soft coal from the engineers on the freight trains. We would stand at the railroad tracks, because the home that we lived in in Crestmont was adjacent to the railroad tracks. We would wave the freight trains down, they would stop, we would trade vegetables, and they would give us soft coal, or coke, not the kind of coke that's associated with cocaine today, but soft coal.    Ms. West: What a horrible way to have to think and differentiate!    Mr. Warner: Yes!    Ms. West: Did you have any heroes when you were growing up  heroes or heroines?    Mr. Warner: Most of our heroes during that particular day, were really people within the community. Most of them were religious, ministers, or Mrs. Armstead, my Sunday school teacher, who was a very, very devout religious person, who, in fact, I had bless all of my children when they were born. These were our heroes. It was a time when you were responsible to every member in the community. You could receive a spanking from Mrs. Armstead, and once she told your parents what had occurred, you would receive another spanking, without question, whether or not you were right or wrong. There were no questions to be asked. Also the same thing occurred at school  whenever a parent was contacted by the school, I was immediately spanked. There was no question about "What did you do, etc, etc.?" The school was always right. I'm very happy that that has changed today, because I know the school is not always right - in terms of today's times.    Ms. West: What was the first movie that you saw, do you recall?    Mr. Warner: When we first went to movies we used to have to walk the railroad tracks to attend a movie theater. That was usually a twenty, twenty-five minute walk, and most of the movies that we saw were, we called them serials at the time,  would be of the Tom Mix caliber: westerns where the good guys wore white hats and the bad guys wore black hats, black clothing. They would be the earliest movies that I recall.    Ms. West: What type of music did you listen to as a youngster?    Mr. Warner: As a youngster, I don't remember music per se, except the recordings that we played on a Victrola for my older sisters who were allowed to go through the courting nuances in the living room. I would sit on top of the stairs and wind the victrola for them, whatever stock, but I don't recall the music as much as I recall running up and down the stairs to wind that victrola when it stopped. I personally guess most of our music at the time was really religious  my mother spent a lot of time, an exceedingly amount of time, in church. That means three times on Sundays, plus any activity that occurred during the week. We were always asked to accompany her to church, so we, too, spent a lot of time in religious activities.  I'm very thankful for this because of the things that happened to me at Temple University: I took a course in dramatics, and the only drama I knew happened to be the church plays that Mrs. Armstead had us involved in at church. So it's from those plays that I can write about choreography and characterizations, etc. All thanks to Mrs. Armstead.    Ms. West: Did you listen to the radio much?    Mr. Warner: The radio was the only instrument at the time, and what I primarily remember is World War II and Gabriel Heater, who was a commentator on the War. He had a very ominous voice. Everything was death and dying and the end of the world kind of approach for Gabriel Heatter. Other than that, I do recall the Amos and Andy radio programs. I'd have to think a little harder to remember beyond that.    Ms. West: What newspaper headlines stand out in your mind as a young adult?    Mr. Warner: Newspaper headlines would be primarily associated again with the War.    Ms. West: And with the War, I'm assuming that you mean World War II?    Mr. Warner: World War II. Because my brother, my oldest brother, was involved in the War, so I was paying attention at that particular time. So most of the headlines that I would recall would speak to the German front or our adventures with Japan, etc.     Ms. West: Do you recall President Roosevelt?    Mr. Warner: Well, I'm especially attuned to Franklin Delano Roosevelt, simply because I was named after him with my middle name. He was seen in the community, especially from my parents' eyes, as somewhat of a hero at the time, even though programmatically I guess we were into welfare lines and all this kind of thing in terms of making a living. But he was viewed as a hero.    Ms. West: As a boy, what games did you play?    Mr. Warner: Games? Games were very simple. We spent a lot of time in the cellar of one of my friends named Charlie Miles. It was a dirt cellar with a stream running through it. And in that stream we had tadpoles and frogs and we spent a lot of time playing there in that little pool of water in the cellar. We also spent a lot of time in blackberry patches and raspberry patches just picking berries. These kinds of activities became our games. We had what we called bunks, that we would build adjacent to the railroad tracks. We had sledding. One of the phenomenal activities was sledding down Rockway Avenue and jumping the railroad track with your sled. The railroad tracks led right into my back yard. But we did some roller-skating, and I had some friends, the Jones, two older women who taught me to play small, organized card games. But that was primarily the extent of games - there was always work to be done. But we did have time to play. We raised chickens for example, so you had to feed chickens, and one of the difficult things coming up was learning to wring the head of a chicken. It was not a game, but it was an activity that had to occur because we were broke. Also, when it was time to clean the well, I was usually lowered into the well on a rope to clean out any dirt that would be in the well. So games were sort of interspersed with whatever activities you had to do.    Ms. West: Was Crestmont  a rural area?    Mr. Warner: Yes. Not really rural, but suburban. But when it comes to rural, I worked on a farm as a youngster.    Ms. West: Yes.    Mr. Warner: That was rural. That was in Hatboro which was ten miles North of Crestmont. That area would be considered rural.    Ms. West: What were the fads when you were coming up? What kinds of clothes did the teenagers wear?    Mr. Warner: I'm trying to think. We wore knickers most of the time. Hand-me-downs were the order of the day. As the fourth boy I would wear whatever was handed down to me from the other boys. Most of our clothing would have been given to us by primarily Mrs. Wagner, for whom my mother worked. And I would have the third wearing of the knickers. We also wore brogans - these are big shoes. Actually the kids today are wearing what I would call brogans, only we had cleats on the bottom of them. We were not allowed to wear our brogans on the way to elementary school  we'd tie them around our necks and put them on at the schoolhouse door so they would last longer. But they also were good soccer boots for playing soccer in school. But long socks and knickers I recall because if you had a hole in your pocket, which we often had, then your marbles would fall down into the knickers to be caught.    Ms. West: Did the boys and girls play pretty much the same games?     Mr. Warner: Oh, actually I don't recall many of the girls' games with the exception of jump rope, because we used to turn rope for the girls once in a while and jump double-dutch on an occasion when they would allow us.    Ms. West: Okay, now we'll get back to your college days.    Mr. Warner: I attended Temple University on the GI bill. That was my opportunity to go to college. My statement in the high school yearbook simply says that I wanted to be somebody, I didn't know what I wanted to become, because the professionals that were available for us to emulate were very few. We had in my community an undertaker, or funeral director, a pharmacist, Dr. Woolfolk, one physician, Dr. Pinkny, and the minister. So these were the professions that you would know.    Ms. West: Right.    Mr. Warner: And of course your elementary school teachers who lived in the community at the time. So these would be the professionals. After an honorable discharge from the United States Marine Corps for my  participation in the Korean War, I attended Temple University where I majored in English for my undergraduate years.    Ms. West: In what year was this?    Mr. Warner: That would be from 1954 to 1958. I graduated from Temple University and I took the examinations for teaching in an urban school system, and I taught at Fitzsimmons Junior High School during the day, which is in North Philadelphia, and I worked at Morlan Recreation in the evenings for a period of time and attended night school for some ten to fifteen years working on certification in reading. I left Temple University where I was attending graduate school to attend a special program at Pennsylvania State University, where I earned my masters and doctorate. I graduated from Pennsylvania State University with a Doctorate in Education in 1972. During that period I went on sabbatical leave from John Bartram Senior High School, which is in Southwest Philadelphia, to attend Pennsylvania State University.     Ms. West: When did you become interested in teaching? When did you realize that this was going to be your vocation?    Mr. Warner: Well, because teaching was the only profession that I really knew, given my experiences with the few people that I could emulate in the community. I decided that I could become a teacher, and become a good teacher. And then I became a motivation director, a vice-principal, and a principal, and finally a superintendent.  My principalship occurred when I applied for a position in Willingboro, New Jersey.    Ms. West: When did you first move to New Jersey?     Mr. Warner: 1970. We moved to New Jersey, and I served as Principal of Willingboro High School and John F. Kennedy High School, in Willingboro, New Jersey until about 1974, when I became acting Superintendent of the Willingboro Schools. And from there, in 1975, I took a position here, in Little Silver, as superintendent of the schools, and I worked there from 1975 to 1997, when I retired.    Ms. West: I understand that you were the first Black superintendent of the Red Bank Regional High School District.      Donald Warner, former superintendent at Red Bank Regional High School, with students Mike Korba and Stephanie McCarter  Mr. Warner: Yes, I was the first Black superintendent there.  I was also the first Black principal in Willingboro, and also the first Black acting Superintendent in Willingboro at the time. One of the things that I think helped me propel forward was the fact that in Willingboro we were on what was called a dual shift, a double shift, and they perceived themselves as having quite a bit of problems, etceteras, but those problems were very miniscule in terms of what I had already been through in the Philadelphia areas where I had served at the senior and the junior high level. While completing my doctorate, I spent two to three years working with gangs, and my doctoral dissertation deals with the gang family that I actually lived with for about a year and a half. So the problems in Willingboro were miniscule as compared to what I had knowledge of in Philadelphia. And the Little Silver  Red Bank Regional High School was the smallest district that I had ever worked in, and it was somewhat an academy as far as I was concerned.    Ms. West: Right. And how did you secure this position?    Mr. Warner: I interviewed along with, I guess, one hundred and fifty other candidates. In fact I was one of the last persons to be interviewed. Interestingly enough, a person now deceased, Dr. Larry Kaplan, had recommended me for this position, and had asked me if I would apply for this position. Larry Kaplan worked for Rutgers University, and I had met him through one of the programs that we had at Willingboro High School. But the person in Monmouth County who I think was most influential in terms of bringing me here, was Dr. Parker, Dr. Alvin Parker, because he drove board members to Willingboro to see my performance there. And from there I became the school superintendent here, after a series of interviews.    Ms. West: Dr. Parker, is this Dr. Parker, Sr.?    Mr. Warner: Senior - no, no..    Ms. West: Or was it a different Dr. Parker?    Mr. Warner: Well, Dr. Parker Sr. would be his father. This is Dr. Alvin Parker, who would be Junior. Right now we're dedicating the Parker Family Health Center after him. That's the Parker I'm talking about. Dr. Alvin Parker, Jr.    Ms. West: Okay. I say it like that because you know we have other tapes with Dr. Parker being referred to, and I just want to make sure that people understand when they see this Dr. Parker's name coming up to whom we are referring.     Mr. Warner: Dr. Parker, Sr. I have never met. He was deceased before my coming into the area. But I did live in his house for two or three months while my home was being built. So I'm sort of familiar from that standpoint.    Ms. West: Right. He had quite an influence on a lot of African American lives, not just in Red Bank, but in the Monmouth County.    Mr. Warner: Correct.    Ms. West: Now you say there were about a hundred people who were interviewing for this position  were there any other Blacks besides yourself?    Mr. Warner: I really don't know. I don't have that information. I never asked, actually. I only know that I was one of the last persons to be interviewed.    Ms. West: How were you received in the educational book by the Board of Education in Red Bank when you got this position?    Mr. Warner: Well, it was very interesting in that the night of my hire here, five of the board members from Willingboro came here to support me in the hiring process. That made quite an impression. And I was received very, very well here and in Little Silver. Now the high school itself is, or was at the time, eighty to eighty five percent Caucasian, ten- percent minority, and five percent other. It was an excellent position, a rare position, here in New Jersey simply because there are some six hundred plus superintendents in the State of New Jersey, and only a few of us were, and continue to be, African Americans.    Ms. West: And you held this position until your retirement?    Mr. Warner: Yes. I was there close to twenty-five years. It was a very successful superintendency. I see many of my students no matter where I go. In fact, as I walked into the Library today, I was watching a young man sweeping outside and I was wondering if he had been one of my students. I didn't stop to speak with him, but I see former students all over in all kinds of professions. It's a great community to work in.    Ms. West: If you could describe your life as a road map, how would you depict it - smooth, rough, up and down, rocky?    Mr. Warner: Actually, it was a little bit of all of those things. I just finished reading a book by Hunard, I think her name is, who talks about hind feet and the preparation. She looks at antelopes and mountain goats and their ability to develop hind feet. As an African American in this country, one has to develop those hind feet. You have to be over prepared in everything, you have to be more knowledgeable in most things, and you have to present yourself in almost a perfect manner. For example, many of the superintendents could, for example, go to the local Molly Pitcher Hotel and sit up at the bar and have cocktails, etc., and nothing would be said about them. I was never able to do that, and I knew I couldn't do that because any incident that could cause negative comments would reflect against me, the school district, and the community, and myself as an African American. I had to be very, very careful in all matters. I had to exercise social distance most of the time. I had to be available, but not available at the same time. So it's a very difficult line, a very thin line, that you walk in terms of being successful. And most of my life has sort of prepared me for that. One of the more interesting things that happened to me happened in high school when an English instructor asked me to read "When Malindy Sings," one of Paul Lawrence Dunbar's poems. That poem is in dialect, and is very difficult to read. It's very interesting that my mother could recite it backwards and forwards. But as a young man coming up, I didn't have that opportunity, and the moment she asked me to read, I knew I couldn't read the dialect. But she, as a white instructor, expected me, as the only Black member in that English class, to be able to read that dialect. I couldn't do it. I've had similar situations throughout life, but I especially remember that. I can read it now, quite well, but at the time, I could not. And it's those little subtleties that begin to smash at what we are as Black Americans. We're always a hyphenated American. And one of the things that you have to remember is that no matter who you are or what you become, no matter how successful you are, you're still a hyphenated American, and people perceive me in that way, and no matter what, you can't change that. It's always very negative in a country that we have established in terms of equality for all, etc. Equality just does not exist at this time.    Ms. West: What would you say is your greatest achievement?    Mr. Warner: My greatest achievement has been, and continues to be, just communicating with individuals. I'm available, approachable, able to -- most of the time -- able to communicate with people. People want to be heard, but are not necessarily seeking answers, because there are many problems that no one can answer. Only God can answer. And so, if one is just available to listen, to be concerned, this is most helpful to persons. There have been other achievements, such as establishing the Performing Arts School at Red Bank Regional High School, this kind of thing.    Ms. West: Tell us about this Performing Arts School at Red Bank Regional High School.    Mr. Warner: Well, the Performing Arts School at Red Bank Regional was new to the County, and we had to go to the court to be sanctioned to have it,  because many districts were against our becoming a performing arts school. But the courts sanctioned us. It was a difficult battle, but it provided an opportunity for Red Bank Regional: for example, the district now has students from at least twenty-five outside districts attending that high school because of the Performing Arts School, and because we offer other vocational programming that a comprehensive high school wouldn't normally offer. So that was a landmark decision here in Monmouth County.    Ms. West: So that's a program that you're responsible for having here.    Mr. Warner: Yes, but that was one item. The most difficult thing with Red Bank Regional is the perception of students from a Little Silver or Shrewsbury wealthy, well to do community, that I'm sure you're very familiar with, against or versus  Red Bank public students. These students mesh all of a sudden and one has to manipulate and make that work, so that on the one hand, the underachiever is achieving and pulling himself or herself forward, and at the same time those who are already achieving can obtain their objectives with relative ease. That's very difficult, but we managed to do it very well.    Ms. West: What would you say is the most unusual thing about yourself?    Mr. Warner: Most unusual….I don't know that I necessarily have anything that's most unusual. I don't know. Most of what I like about me presently has to do with my ability to internalize the greater fears of mankind and somehow or other be able to at this point deal with them effectively. And here I'm talking about areas of pain, death, dying, and the greater issues that we hide and don't spend enough time talking about. These are issues of great concern, and these are the issues that I think I'm able to deal with now. It's interesting because during the years of my time in the United States Marine Corps, 1951 to 1954 on the front lines, as a young person, I never looked at death in terms of it ever happening to me, and yet it was happening all around me.    Ms. West: And now that you're older you see your mortality?    Mr. Warner: But now that you've had those experiences, you can piggyback on those experiences, and deal with what is now. It's not a matter of "becoming" anymore, you revert back to "being." So it becomes interesting.    Ms. West: So when you see your life today, and in your quiet time or whatever, do you reflect back as "dear youth" or what have you, and how different times have become?    Mr. Warner: The times, or me?    Ms. West: Well, say with you. Say when you were a youngster, one of your parent's friends or other said to you, "Donald, what would you want to be when you grow up?" And maybe you weren't prepared for the question, but the average,  I guess there was a fireman, a policeman, and then as you were going on, you might see say a mason, or whatever, and maybe you'd like to be a bricklayer, whatever. Did you ever dream that you'd be in this position?    Mr. Warner: I never dreamed that I'd be in any position. It was interesting to note that I said I wanted to "be somebody,"  yet I didn't know what that somebody was all about. I had absolutely no idea. I never thought I'd have an opportunity to go to college, but then the GI bill came about because of my service in the Marine Corps, so that gave me an opportunity to attend college, and it was after I'd met so many different people in the Marine Corps that I realized that I had to do something that was unique, something that would set me aside from all the others, and that is when I really began to pursue a higher education. I did not necessarily know what I was going to do or become. And I'm still striving to become as it were, because I'm now a full time student at Princeton Theological Seminary.    Ms. West: Now looking at you are still studying, so I assume there is something you still are likely to accomplish.    Mr. Warner: Well, I spent, as I said earlier, from the earliest of days until now, quite a bit of time in religious institutions and churches, and I teach an adult Sunday school class on Sunday mornings. Now I'm pursuing a degree in the ministry, so that this may be my final step. I'm not sure, hopefully there'll be many more after this, but it's very interesting that when I was a young boy, my mother had said to me at one point when one of her brothers died, there was a scholarship for me if I wanted to take it, to go into the ministry. The money would be left by her brother, Eldridge. And at the time I said, "Mom, that is the last thing I want to do." And it's very interesting that this is the last thing that I'm doing. So I'm pursuing that particular vocation right now. I have some other things I wish to do, such as publishing a volume of poetry, and perhaps writing a book that I could do in the next two years. I did a poetry presentation about six months ago. I have already written over two hundred and fifty poems, so it's just a matter of organizing them and having them presented.    Ms. West: Has anything been published yet?    Mr. Warner: The Asbury Park Press did a couple of them, and there are a couple in a couple of poetry books. But I haven't compiled them yet.    Ms. West: Is there any other writing that you've done?    Mr. Warner: Well, I've written research articles for the American Administrative Association, and a few articles of that nature along the way, and I've presented in my professional field several times.    Ms. West: Does the public have privy to this?    Mr. Warner: Yes.    Ms. West: One of the things we haven't mentioned though, is your family - you're married?    Mr. Warner: Yes,  we just celebrated our forty-third wedding anniversary July 27th. I'm married to Mercedes Roney Warner. She's originally from South Philadelphia. She is now a retired elementary school teacher. She just retired last year. We have three children, all of whom are successful: successful means out of the house and working. We have Dr. Beth Warner, who is a clinical psychologist  Nicholas Warner, a lawyer  and Thomas Warner, a computer and mechanical engineer.    Ms. West: Okay, besides Dr. Parker, is there any one else in Monmouth County who might have had a profound influence on your life?    Mr. Warner: Besides Dr. Parker, well there were Flo and Chet Apy and those earlier people I had spoken about in terms of Mrs. Dorothy Armstead and the community of Crestmont. And I had mentioned earlier that when I was coming up, you are really raised by the community . And it's very interesting that even while I was attending Temple University, people in the community kept a donation can in the beer garden (we used to call taverns "beer gardens"), and people would put change in there for my education. I would go in each Friday to pick up the can,  and I used that money to purchase books and to give me transportation from Crestmont to Temple University, which was in Philadelphia. So when I say I was raised by the community, I mean it in a sincere sense. People of all types, from all walks of life helped me to get where I am today, and I have been doing everything I possibly can to help others to reach their goals.    Ms. West: Then you are really giving back, as they say.    Mr. Warner: Well, I'm trying to give back in terms of advice and counseling, and to those in need. I try to help youngsters who are in school in terms of seeing that they have their spending change, etc. Spending change is very important. I remember one instance at Temple University when I was darn near starving and on Columbia Avenue, which is Cecil B. Moore Avenue now, named after Cecil B. Moore. There was a tavern we would go to every noon period for lunch, and sometimes we would just go in there to smell the food, not having any money. One day I walked in and someone at the bar dropped five dollars, folded, onto the floor, and I got up out of the booth where I was seated with my other two buddies and went over to the floor and I stood on top of that five dollars. Now, actually, I should have picked up the money and given it back to the person who dropped it - I know that. But, I was so hungry, we were all so hungry, that we used the five dollars improperly, I have to keep emphasizing that, improperly, and we bought soup where we were at the bar.    Ms. West: Well, you had to sustain yourself. The reason you did what you did was self-preservation.    Mr. Warner: Yes, you can rationalize it, but it was still the incorrect thing to do.    Ms. West: Oh, right, right. What are the milestones in your life?    Mr. Warner: Milestones. Do you mean milestones as the important posts where changes and differences were made in your life?    Ms. West: Right, such as when you were graduating, or the first job that you got after that, your marriage, and whatever.    Mr. Warner: I could point out some of those milestones. Completing high school was a very important milestone.  I'm trying to think if any one else graduated in my family. I think one other, my younger brother, who received a GED diploma because he followed me into the Marine Corps, and one other sister graduated. So out of eight of us, only three of us actually graduated from high school. The other milestone was, of course, graduating from college the first time. But then receiving a Doctorate from Pennsylvania State University was a huge, huge milestone. Not only for me, but for anybody who graduates. And it was difficult for me -- more of a milestone for me because of  how old I was - I'm trying to think of how old I was at that point. And because most of the people graduating with me were very young. But I had gone into the Marine Corps, worked a few years, then attended college. So, it was a very huge milestone. My marriage has been a significant milestone in that I was fortunate in being able to marry my pen pal. My wife Mercedes was my pen pal while I was in the Marine Corps overseas. So I married her and we've had, I think, a wonderful life together - I think that's a milestone. And then each position that came along became a milestone: moving from teacher to motivation director, to vice principal, to principal. One of the more interesting people in my life that I did not mention is Cecil B. Moore, who was a Black attorney in Philadelphia. There is, in Philadelphia, a home rule charter provision, which allows the City Board of Education to appoint five percent of its personnel into Administrative positions without certification. And because of the protestations and actions of Cecil B. Moore, there were four of us who became Administrators without certification. Now, when that occurred, and after that occurred, we then entered into our respective doctoral programs at Penn State University. We took sabbaticals. That's when we became certified. But we were allowed to work in a position prior to that because of the home rule charter and because of Cecil Moore, an activist for us back in those days. So that was a milestone. The other couple of milestones, believe it or not, and this is going to be a weird kind of milestone for you, was participating in the Civil Rights movement. We did many, many things in Philadelphia back in the days when Rizzo was police chief there. We marched around Gerard College day after day after day. And one of the more interesting things that happened to me just with Gerard College alone was the fact that a representative came to Red Bank Regional High School from Gerard College to give a Black student a scholarship. That was interesting because Gerard College was a school for orphaned white boys. And to have many moons later, many years later, someone from Gerard College where I picketed every day along with other groups, to come there was one of the more outstanding things to happen. The second milestone associated with the Civil Rights movement was to attend the Washington march in 1963 and then go back to the Million Man march. The difference, though, was that this time I'm marching with my kids, my own kids. And that was one of the saddest moments in my life. Because when we marched in 1963 we were marching to end everything, and now here I am marching again, only this time my kids are grown. But that was a kind of sad milestone for me in terms of our growth as African Americans in this country. So that was a milestone, too. I have a lot of different kinds of milestones.    Ms. West: Speaking of the marches and things there, what concerns you the most about the state of the world today?    Mr. Warner: Well, what concerns me most is that I've lived a lifetime, I'm sixty-seven now, and the world hasn't changed enough in terms of the acceptance of all human beings as human beings. We're still somewhat running rampant with degrees of prejudice, discrimination, and it's everyplace. I'm studying at Princeton Theological Seminary, and sometimes when we discuss some of the great issues, you would be surprised at some of the Caucasian students who are going into the ministry under this great commission of love, but who actually have nuances of hatred in their heart that they can't seem to realize. You see, because one of the things that they will be able to do is, once they graduate, given our segregated system of churches, not have to deal with people like me again unless I appear there as a congregational member through some miracle. And so they can take their attitudes and move from where they are now in terms of their utilization of the scriptures to keep people in their places and move into their own little communities with those same attitudes. It's very disturbing that we have not been able to make the changes that need to be made in that particular area. I heard Geraldo Rivera, that news commentator -    Ms. West: Geraldo Rivera?    Mr. Warner: Yes, Geraldo Rivera - mentioning that he's thinking about running for mayor of New York on the platform of the equality of the races. Now, that's great that he would be thinking of that, but the fact that equality of the races has to be a platform is disturbing, and it needs to be a platform given the present mayor of New York City and his pronouncements, no question about that, but I doubt very seriously that he would be able to win on such a platform.    Ms. West: I doubt it also. Well, tell me is there any part of your life that you would like to relive?    Mr. Warner: Well, it would be very easy to say that at this stage in the game, at my age, I should want to relive all of it. But that is not the case. I've had some very, very good moments and all of the moments have been meaningful but, there's no moment that I want to relive - even the moment of the greatest joy, I don't want to relive.    Ms. West: What legacy will you be leaving your family?    Mr. Warner: I hope the legacy that I leave my family will be a sense of family. Period. If they can have a sense of family and love with their fellow human beings, I'd be very thrilled. But I was disturbed as I watched the hip-hop awards just last night or the night before. There must have been about five thousand people out there in Pasadena at that particular performance. It lasted two hours, and I watched these awards purposefully. As I listened to each person receive an award, I watched the crowd and I thought about the fact that these five thousand persons must all have gone to and graduated from somebody's high school somewhere, and yet the utilization of their language would set us back fifty years - and that disturbs me. I wish we could somehow or other find a way to recognize hip-hopping, gangster rap as a legitimate source within the music world, but at the same time have it not influence our young people in such a way that it ends up being a negative mechanism that is existing within their lives. I'm very concerned about that. I understand that, and given all the time that I've spent in the cities of America, and working with gangs, I understand  that life, and that there must be some way to express all those particular concerns. But when you place on top of that recognition layers of glorification, gold in terms of chains, and big automobiles that are non-existent for most of us, etc., it becomes very negative for me.    Ms. West: Well, along the lines like that, what would you say are your deepest values?    Mr. Warner: I don't know that there are any values beyond love and family. Love is the greatest of all expressions that leaps from heart to heart, from human being to human being. You can't top that. You know when I talk about family, I'm not talking about the nuclear family, relative to father, mother, siblings, I'm talking about however the family is. Because my father, for example, died at a very young age. And my mother raised all of us, and so I never allow anyone to put down a single parent, especially the single woman who is raising kids. Because I know it can work. But sometimes we use that as an excuse.    Ms. West: Oh, yes.    Mr. Warner: To not have things work.    Ms. West: Well, with all your experiences with people and what have you, what would you say is your personal strength?    Mr. Warner: I guess my personal strength emanates from those experiences and being able to predict, not only conversations, but behaviors, so that I'd begin to develop a sense for what's going to come next. And you begin to understand the dynamics of groups and group behavior, and learn how to utilize those strengths and weaknesses to, as it were, dig a path, a path on which you can follow your energy and keep moving and have people advance.    Ms. West: What advice could you give future generations?    Mr. Warner: Well, the only real advice is, number one, you have to know who you are. And for most of us the only thing we have, and I've thought about this a lot, is our names. And that name is very important, and if you can somehow or other manage to maintain your name and all that goes with it, in a way that's meaningful. People who don't even know you can say, "Oh, there goes the Warner boy,"  and will know or the Warner boy, or the Jones girl - and will want to be somehow or other like them. If you can do that, then,  I think you've managed all you need to manage.    Ms. West:  Prior to January one, we were inundated with so much talk about entering this new Millennium, and how things should be, and what we would like to see. What would like to see change? What could you add to create the perfection of a better time than what we just left?    Mr. Warner: You know I have to think about it. You know that we're going to be in an increasingly technological world, and as technology moves forward, it makes for more and more depersonalization of that which is human, and I'm concerned about that.  We have these advances of technology and I'm looking forward to them because I'm hoping that there'll be a time when those young people out there, for example, won't have to sit in a college classroom, they can sit at home at their desks and have everything that's available to them in terms of interactive video and the whole business. And yet, that lack of human intervention and the ability to reach out and touch someone is going to be missing and that's what frightens me about technology, if anything frightens me about the future as I perceive it. Because we still have to get to a point where we can reach out and touch individuals to make a difference. It's the dynamics of the heart that's missing. Whatever that is.    Ms. West: Right. Whatever that is. It makes you think. It's making me think. Is there anything else you would like to tell us about yourself?    Mr. Warner: Well, I have a thousand stories, but I don't know what you mean.    Ms. West: Well, you see, we're recording now, as you know, for history, so if one hundred, two hundred, three hundred or better years from today somebody gets to the computer and pulls up Monmouth County and are scrolling and they come to you…    Mr. Warner: Well, Monmouth County itself is a fantastic community to live in, and we're going to see, I'm sure, a complete mushrooming of population here. But along with that mushrooming we're going to see a more diversified population, and Monmouth County is going to have to deal with that. Monmouth County is going to have to look back at all the negative nuances that are still existing. Even in the midst of this great affluence, we still have housing patterns, employment patterns, and college admissions patterns that work against segments of the population, and no town, no county, no America is going to advance until we come to grips with those problems. They don't go away, and we don't spend enough time or money, primarily money, dealing with those issues. Everything is economics and money for us here, let's face it, and until we begin to put the resources, especially the financial resources, into making things happen, they don't happen.     Ms. West: How do you perceive Monmouth County, then, as a place to live years down the pike?    Mr. Warner: Having lived in several other areas, I can say that this will still be the better of other places to live, unless, for example, the urban centers become totally revitalized, re-energized, in fact, reinvented, and that's never going to happen. I don't know that resources are going to be there to allow it to happen. We live in a searching and seeking world, and people will continue to look for Nirvana, and Nirvana will continue to be in those rural areas that you were talking about early on in the interview. People think that there is that untainted space where they can be alone and be with their families and whatever it is that they own. And unfortunately, that kind of Nirvana takes us away from dealing with one another, and being the nation that we need to be, or the county that we need to be.    Ms. West: So you've lived in Monmouth County twenty-five years?    Mr. Warner: Yes. And five years in Burlington County.    Ms. West: Why did your children leave the county?    Mr. Warner: Employment opportunities.    Ms. West: And when they come back to visit, when they come home, do they kind of wish they could be still residing here in the county?    Mr. Warner: I don't think so. And that's good, because they have no real sense of the demographic other than this is home, this is where Mom and Dad live. But their world is their world, and that's technology, and that's the way it should be. And I want that to continue for them, because their world should be their world. For example, my son, my youngest son, Thomas the engineer, is getting ready to fly to Brazil for his company. That's great. That's the way it should be. So they're not limited. My daughter is getting ready to present over in Paris next year. That's the world today, that's the way it should be. I don't want them necessarily to identify with any particular place other than the fact that this is where they were raised and this is where Mom and Dad existed for a while.    Ms. West: Then your children didn't even get any education here in Monmouth County?    Mr. Warner: Yes, they did. They're graduates of the high school here, Monmouth Regional.    Ms. West: All three of them?    Mr. Warner: Yes.    Ms. West: And are they satisfied with the type of education that they received here in the county?    Mr. Warner: They are, but I don't know that I was necessarily happy with all aspects of the education they received because they had to go through all the same subtleties and sophistications I had to go through as a young person. I am hoping that those young people out there now will not have to go through that. But I know darn well they will. That's why I said it's important that we know who we are, and what our name stands for. So that when we run into these incidences of discrimination and racial defamation, we can deal with ourselves and still survive.    Ms. West: Well, I just hope that whoever listens to this tape, or reads the transcript, has actually heard just what you've said. It makes you think, it makes me think. I'm very grateful that you've given me almost two hours of your time. It was very interesting, most inspiring.    Mr. Warner: Thank you. I was happy to do it.    Ms. West: And every time that I do this, I hope that people are listening or reading. I sincerely hope so.    Mr. Warner: The thing about young minds is that they can do two or three things at one time and still get the point.    Ms. West: Well, I know the library thanks you. You brought a little book with you, is there something in that book that you wanted to refer to?    Mr. Warner: Oh, no, no, I just thought that in case you were late, I was just going to continue reading.    Ms. West: Oh, okay.    Mr. Warner: I'm reading Socrates, Buddha, Confucius, and Jesus.    Ms. West: Oh, my heavens. Well, thank you again, Mr. Warner.
MonmouthCounty;David Engebretson;1932;2000;David Engebretson, 1932, 2000            Remembering The 20th Century: An Oral History of Monmouth County    Date of Interview: August 15, 2000   Name of Interviewer: Douglas Aumack  Premises of Interview: Mr. Engebretson's home, Colts Neck, NJ  Birth date of subject: June 10, 1932    Mr. Aumack:  What year did you come to Monmouth County? And did your parents bring you? Just describe how you came here, please.      Morganville School Picture, 1941    Mr. Engebretson: Well, when I was about two or three years old, I had scarlet fever and double mastoids. This is a really serious illness: you can die from diseases like that. Where we lived at that time was in Bay Ridge, in Brooklyn. My mother took care of me, and stayed in the hospital with me, because she was a practical nurse. She stayed in the hospital with me day and night. I have a brother, Edward, and she couldn't really take care of him because she was with me. I had tubes all over the place, in my ears and nose, mouth, etc. My brother was sent up to Calicoon Center, to mom's parents' house. They were farmers there. When I got well enough to come back home, my parents heard about a farm here in Monmouth County that they could move to and get fresh air, etc. for me.  My father worked as a steelworker in New York City. They moved here, and he still continued doing steelwork and later worked as a rigger in the Brooklyn Navy Yard. They moved up to Beacon Hill. There were 500 apple trees on this farm owed by a family named Valenti. We were the caretakers on the farm, this was now at the start of the Depression. We stayed there rent free, but we had to mow the lawns and take care of the place. We could have the crops from the apple trees. My father learned how to prune and spray the trees, which he had never done before in Norway. Things went pretty well, and we started to attend school. My brother was six years older than myself. We went to the Morganville School, and at that time it had five rooms. There was a teacher for every two grades, and I still remember the names of all the teachers. One of the teachers became a college professor, and her name was Susan Partridge. You had kindergarten and first grade together with one teacher. There weren't many children at this school because there weren't that many children in the school district. To give an example of the size of Marlboro Township: when I went to school and graduated in 1947, there were fifteen children graduating from Morganville School. That was half of Marlboro Township, twenty-two square miles. The other half of Marlboro Township school children went to the Marlboro Village School. That was roughly the same size, about fifteen students.    Mr. Aumack: Was this in grammar school?    Mr. Engebretson:  Kindergarten through eighth grade. We were a receiving school for the Robertsville School.  Robertsville School had one teacher who taught grades K through 5. Once those children reached the sixth grade, they would come to our school. We were a receiving school from that one-room schoolhouse. The children would be bussed in from Robertsville School, which is located on Tennent Road. Our school itself was quite interesting. We had outdoor toilets. There was one for the girls and one for the boys. During the summer it was so smelly, you just wanted to do what you had to do as fast as you could and get back inside. And in the wintertime, it was so cold you didn't hang around  they came back to the class right away. We had one custodian. Our rooms were heated with gratings on the floor. We did not have forced air, but gravity-fed air. The heat would rise from the floor vents. The school had one great, big furnace which heated the entire building. The custodian used to shovel coal into the furnace. His name was Theodore (Dory) Keiler, he was quite a character. He chewed tobacco, and you could always tell when he was ready to bank the fire in the morning. He would open up the door, shake the grates, throw on the coal, and then give a big blob of spit on top of the hot coals. And they would sizzle. Only then it was ready to be banked for the day.    Mr. Aumack: Could you smell the tobacco on the smoke or in the heat?    Mr. Engebretson: No. In the basement we had coal delivered, and he really didn't want to go out in the hot or cold weather, so he would relieve himself on the coal in the coal bin. This created quite an odor in the basement!    Mr. Aumack: Oh! I hope you didn't smell that.    Mr. Engebretson: Whenever anybody was asked to go down to the basement and get the custodian, there were few volunteers. In the morning he had a ritual. He would shake the grates, and that would be just at the time when the principal and the other teachers would be saying The Lord's Prayer and the flag salute. As he would shake the grates, the principal would just stand there and wait for him to get through, and then we would continue the morning exercises. We walked two miles to school on dirt roads  they weren't really paved until the late 1950s. So during the late spring and autumn, it was fine and we could walk down the dusty roads. In the spring you would sink up to your knees in mud. In the winter, of course they didn't plow these roads. You walked through the snow, and it was up to your knees. Of course in those days, maybe my knees were a little bit shorter than they are today. We would walk down the road to school past one house where they had bad dogs. That always really frightened me because I always wondered if they would come out charging and would bite me. They were Dobermans, and they were bad news. That pretty much took care of school, except during the War. During World War II they would have collections for pots and pans at the school. You would take the tin foil off the gum wrappers, roll it up, and then bring that in, too. They would use it for the War effort.    Mr. Aumack: Do you know what they used those for? Do you have any idea?    Mr. Engebretson: No, I am not sure. About the tin foil, it may have been used at that time for something to do with radar. The aluminum was used to manufacture airplanes. We sold seeds for Victory Gardens, too. They came in green boxes, and they were usually contained vegetable seeds, for Victory Gardens which was part of the War effort.  What else did we do? We brought in tin cans, flattened out, and brought them to school. We used to buy War stamps at school. There were so many stamps you would put in a book, and then you would trade them in at the post office for a War Bond. These were called Victory Bonds. As we walked home from school, we would pass by some windows in homes, and there would be a little flag in the window with a star. That represented a family member that was in the Service.    Mr. Aumack: So if you had four stars on a flag, you had four people in the Service.    Mr. Engebretson: Yes. And if there was a gold star, it meant that the serviceman in the home had died in action.    Mr. Aumack: Did they have to pay for these flags?    Mr. Engebretson: No, I think they were given to the parents by the government. At this time, we had rationing.  I am sure you have been told about rationing.    Mr. Aumack: Yes, but tell us more about it, please.    Mr. Engebretson: Being a farmer, my father had one type of stamp that he could use which would allow him to buy gasoline for his tractors. There was another type of stamp that was used for cars. Actually there were three, an "A," "B," and "C" stamp. I am doing some research on it right now using the OPA, or the Office of Price Administration, which regulated all rationing. You had different stamps for different uses, and that was based on how many gallons of gasoline you needed and the type of work you did. Sugar was rationed. Your shoes were rationed, too. Meat was rationed  we would render the fat from our two hogs and bring that to the butcher shop to be used for the War effort, too. They probably made soap or grease out of it. Those are the sort of things that you had during the War. It is foreign to the people today to realize that there was actually rationing. Our family had only one car. The car headlights in those days used bulbs--this was before sealed beam headlights. You had two bulbs for each headlight. One bulb was dim, and the bright lights were when both bulbs were on. In the early Model A Ford, you had no heaters. You had what was called a manifold heater, and that was right along the side of the manifold where it went out to the muffler. If you sat in traffic, you got no heat. But the faster you went, the more heat came through the manifold heater.    Mr. Aumack: And that heated your body.    Mr. Engebretson: Yes. Well, when you were going faster, the air scoop would come through and bring that heat into the cab of the car.    Mr. Aumack: I was lucky enough to drive a Model A. These things had a top speed of maybe sixty or eighty? I got it up to forty mph! (laughter)    Mr. Engebretson: Well, at eighty mph you may as well whistle "I'm Coming Home" (Heaven). The top speed you should have traveled was fifty-five or sixty mph.    Mr. Aumack: What was the speed you could go on the kind of roads back then?    Mr. Engebretson: Usually about forty or forty-five mph in the Model A Ford. Nobody was in a big hurry, and the roads were not that great in those days, especially if you went the back roads. They were all dirt. I don't know if you ever listened to the old radios in those cars, but you turned it on and after a fashion, you would hear a loud crackle or buzz. We only had a few stations back then, but the noise you would hear would be your engine running because there were no noise suppressors on the spark plugs in those days so you could hear all this static in the background. The faster you went, the more static occurred, and you couldn't hear the radio. So if you pulled over at the side of the road when your spark plugs were giving off less static, because the engine would be running slower and you could then finish listening to the program. Now the other interesting thing they had in the cars when you were driving down the road and if it was raining, you would turn on your windshield wipers. They were operated on vacuum from the carburetor. So that meant if you were going uphill or going fast to pass somebody, the vacuum was being taken to draw more gasoline into the carburetor, and your wiper would slow down or stop. Then when you let up on the gas, the wipers would go faster. There was a failsafe-- if for some reason that vacuum line coming from the carburetor to the wiper broke, you could use a little handle and operate the wiper by hand.    Mr. Aumack: Oh, manually!    Mr. Engebretson: Yes.    Mr. Aumack: Now was there one wiper or two?    Mr. Engebretson: One wiper. The passenger side didn't get a wiper.    Mr. Aumack: Oh, I guess that was tough for them, right? And these were on the Model A Ford, right?    Mr. Engebretson: The Ford Model As.      Mr. Engebretson's father with his enormous truck  Mr. Aumack: Now did these come out in 1930?    Mr. Engebretson: We had a 1932, and they may have come out a little earlier. They had a Model B, also. But you had your choice of tires, too. You could get sixteen inch tires and seventeen inch tires. For the pickup trucks, they had nineteen inch tires. The reason for this was because the roads were so muddy that the bottom of your truck would scrape if your tires weren't high enough.    Mr. Aumack: Now when you say sixteen inches, do you mean wide?    Mr. Engebretson: No, sixteen inches would be the measurement of the inside of the tire bead to bead or how it fits on the rim. There was only one church nearby, and that was the Methodist church in Morganville. I went there. My parents are Lutheran, but you either had to go way over into Keyport to get to the closest Lutheran church. In Matawan they had the Baptist church, the Methodist church, and the Episcopalian church. Then going the other way toward Marlboro, about another six miles, there was a Reformed church. Robertsville had a Baptist church. So if you wanted to go to a church nearby, you went to the Methodist church in Morganville. On the farm, everybody really worked for seven days a week, so you didn't really go to church much. Mainly my parents were just trying to make a living, because those were the Depression days. We had a hired man on the farm, and he was paid a dollar a day and room and board.    Mr. Aumack: Was that considered a lot of money for a hired hand?      Mr. Engebretson's father and farm hands working  Mr. Engebretson: That was a good wage, with room and board. Then there was another fellow that lived maybe a mile away, and he used to cut wood and brush for the farmers. That's all he did for a living. His name was Dan Garan. He moved over to Keyport. If you wanted anything cut along the headlands, he would do that. That was pretty much what we had in the way of labor in those days. During the War, we had migrant laborers come up from the South. They usually came in a bus, and there would be around twenty or twenty-five of them on a bus. We picked the tomatoes that my father planted. There were fifty thousand tomato plants. They would pick the tomatoes, and during the War, a lot of people came from town to help you, because it was part of the War effort. It meant food for the war effort, so they would come and help us. I don't think they even charged us anything but they received food for their help. We had a big table on which we would put out sweet corn, tomatoes and other foods for them to eat. Everybody pitched in during the War, and even Norwegian sailors. They came from Bay Ridge when they were off the merchant ships for a week or two, to help on the farm.    Mr. Aumack: Is Norwegian your family background?     Mr. Engebretson: Yes, both sides of my family. My father came over from Tonsberg, near Oslo, and was here about a year when he was drafted into the Army. He was about seventeen years old and he served for three years.    Mr. Aumack: The American Army?    Mr. Engebretson: Yes. Then during World War II, my brother couldn't join the Navy because he had poor eyesight. So he went into the Merchant Marine and sailed across to Poland and other countries in Europe when the Germans had the U-boats going. And then I joined the Korean War, and I was in the Seabees. I just wanted to say a little bit about what went on in the homes. From the 1930s all the way up until the time I graduated, we had a range, a stove range. Actually it used wood for the fuel. It was one of those black ones that you lift up the lid and put the wood in.    Mr. Aumack: So you would add wood to the range.      Engebretson family in the apple orchard    Mr. Engebretson: It had four tops. And then over on the side was a warming area to keep the food warm. And then the other part was where the firing of the wood took place. So that was my job, to fill up the wood box. Remember I said we had orchards? My father would trim all the trees, and sometimes we would have some pretty big limbs. In the fall, we would cut those into wood the size to fit the stove. And OSHA would probably go nuts if they ever saw it, but we had what was called a buzz saw. It was three feet wide, and operated by a pulley from the tractor. My job was to grab the wood as it was being cut and throw it in a pile. My father would push this wood against the saw frame, and it would be pushed against the saw. What was scary about it was that you could hear this thing. It was sharp as a razor. It had to be sharp to cut the wood. And all you could hear was a whirring sound. Picture me standing there, at twelve or thirteen years old, and throwing the wood in a pile.    Mr. Aumack: So you were face to face staring at this three-foot wide, big saw?    Mr. Engebretson: Yes.    Mr. Aumack: How close did you get to this saw?    Mr. Engebretson: (laughter) Well the wood would come out as an eighteen inch piece, so I would usually grab it at the end. That meant I was eighteen inches away from it.    Mr. Aumack: Whew! You were only a little more than a foot away from a thing that could cut you in half.    Mr. Engebretson: Oh easily, yes. But this is what farm kids did. Now we also had to spray the trees.      Mr. Engebretson's father on tractor spraying trees  Mr. Aumack: Describe that.    Mr. Engebretson: Well my father had a sprayer, and it was called a one-gun sprayer. It developed about 700 pounds of pressure. You had to reach up to the top of the trees, which were maybe forty-five feet high. You sprayed with arsenic of lead, DDT, and lime sulfur. When you sprayed, you didn't use a mask. There were no masks around. The instructions on the spraying material read "Do Not Ingest," which means "don't eat it."    Mr. Aumack: Did it say anything about inhaling it?    Mr. Engebretson: No. We would spray all day long, I would take time off from school to do that. When we were done at the end of the day, we were white with arsenic of lead. It was all over our face, clothes, and everything else. And it was the same thing with the lime sulfur. We would be yellow after spraying that. But it never really effected us.    Mr. Aumack: Now you came to Monmouth County because you were sick, so you came here for fresh air, right?    Mr. Engebretson: Yes.    Mr. Aumack: And now you are spraying these chemicals, and did your father even think about what it might do to you?    Mr. Engebretson: After the sickness, I was pretty healthy then. I was big and strapping, you know. And it looked like I could eat poison and live! And it never bothered any of the other farmer's kids, because they sprayed also. It was just a fact of life that you went out and helped your father. I helped him go down to Lakewood, and we used to clean out chicken houses, and get the chicken manure. They would pay you to clean the chicken houses, and then you kept the manure. Then you would put the manure on the field, usually in the wintertime, because that was a farmer's downtime. And you would have these big piles of manure, and it looked like Mount Fuji! Smoke would be coming up, and it was really steam from the ammonia in the manure that was cooking. Farther out from the center, if we had a snowfall, the snow would be on the sides, but not at the top of the pile because it was so hot. And it did two things. It killed all of the seeds, because the seeds pass through the chicken's digestive system. By the time spring came, it was pretty good fertilizer. Then we could put it in a spreader and put it over the field. But you know there are a lot of things that we did on a farm that today you would think it was gross. But we did it for a living. You just worked hard and did what you had to do.    Mr. Aumack: Let me ask you a quick question, but I don't want you to lose your place. You mentioned that you took time off from school to work on the farm. Where did you live when you were young?      Eating out on Beacon Hill during World War II    Mr. Engebretson: Beacon Hill.    Mr. Aumack: Where is that near?    Mr. Engebretson: If you travel Route 79 from Matawan, you will go past Tennent Road on the right-hand side. Go about one and a half miles, and on the left is Beacon Hill Road. Go about two miles and our farm was on the left side. Also on the left side of Route 9 was the Morganville School. They added on to it, and I think Coastal Learning Center is operating out of there now.    Mr. Aumack: So it is near Morganville.    Mr. Engebretson: Everybody took time off from school. You had farm work, and you did it, especially during planting season. The teachers understood it, and they gave you homework. That was just part of life then.    Mr. Aumack: Out of your class, who else was a farmer's daughter or son?    Mr. Engebretson: Let me see. Tom Smith, who has the florist in Matawan, he worked for Becker's Greenhouses. They are since long gone. There were probably about three of us all together who were farmer's children. Richard Guth and the Ronson children also lived on a farm.    Mr. Aumack: Out of a class of how many?    Mr. Engebretson: Thirteen.    Mr. Aumack: Now this was thirteen students from K through eight?    Mr. Engebretson: No, thirteen students graduating from the eighth grade. You have to figure that Marlboro Township is forty-three square miles, so a graduating class of thirteen students in the eighth grade represented twenty-two square miles. So that is pretty sparse. There was one other fellow who was a farmer, but he came in later on in the year. His name was Bob Niveson, and he is a Transportation Coordinator in the Freehold Regional School District. That was about it in my class, about three farmers altogether. We did trapping, and my brother, Ed, was a really good trapper. Now you may say that is cruel or awful, but they really encouraged trapping in those days for the furs to be used by all the people in the service.    Mr. Aumack: Now what do you mean by "they"?    Mr. Engebretson: The government. The servicemen needed the furs for the cold climate. It was sort of strange the way it all came about. Teenagers like my brother, he would be maybe twelve or thirteen years old, would run a trap line. You would take those animals out of your traps, and you would skin them. Then you would put them on a stretching board, which would either be made of wood or metal. Then you would scrape all the meat and fat off, and you would let it sit there for about a week. When you got all your pelts together, you could send them to Sears Roebuck or Montgomery Ward, and they would send you back money for them. You never knew what you were going to get, but they were always pretty fair. Then there was another man who made a living this way, and he came from Englishtown. His name was David Shermal. He had a little Chevy coupe with a rumble seat, and he would drive around to all the high school kid's and teenager's homes and buy their pelts. And he would give them the money right on the spot.    Mr. Aumack: Now what kind of animals did you trap?      David Engebretson with his dogs, Teddy and Prince    Mr. Engebretson: They would buy squirrel furs, but they weren't nearly that valuable. There was raccoon, possum was fairly good, mink, and muskrat. Those were pretty good pelts to sell. Rabbit was ok, but it wasn't that much because it had a very thin skin. The interesting thing about trapping is that you just don't go out and set traps out. You first have to know what you are trapping. My brother used to scope out all the area along the banks of the creeks.    Mr. Aumack: Which creeks, do you know the name of them?    Mr. Engebretson: His trap line ran in the back of Colliers. It ran all along down there and almost to the creek at The Marlboro State Hospital.    Mr. Aumack: Marlboro State Hospital, the psychiatric center?    Mr. Engebretson: Yes.    Mr. Aumack: Wow!    Mr. Engebretson: Later, when he was eleven, sometimes he would take his bike and park it halfway, and then he would work it both ways. Once you found out what type of animals you were going to trap, you just didn't take a stake and put your trap down. You had to boil the traps.    Mr. Aumack: Boil them?    Mr. Engebretson: Yes. You would boil them with tannin log chips, with little chips from tannin bark, and paraffin. Now you might wonder why you had to do that. When you boil it with the chips, it would take away the scent of a human being. The traps were made of steel, and the paraffin gave it a nice coating and kept it from rusting. Then you would go out and set your traps.    Mr. Aumack: So the tannin took away the human smell that the animals would pick up, and the paraffin kept it from rusting.    Mr. Engebretson: Right. When you laid your trap, you always put a little bit of leaves over it. This way the animal wouldn't see the trap and would step on it. Looking back on it, it was pretty cruel to the animals. Leg-hold traps are cruel.    Mr. Aumack: These were leg-hold traps?    Mr. Engebretson: Yes. But that is all they had in those days. Trapping was a source of income, and a lot of the teenagers in Marlboro Township would do this if they were interested in trapping. And that is the way teenagers made their money. There was something else interesting during the War. Remember I told you we only had one car? Gas was limited and rationed. There was a fellow that would come around to all the farms, and he had a big van. In the van was bread, milk, butter, cheeses, and everything you would want for your house. And it was called Dick's Rolling Store, and his name was Dick Schumacher. His garage is still there on Route 34 right across the street from Red Roof Tavern. He would drive up to your driveway and stop and ask if you had anything you wanted to buy. This saved people from having to go to the store, because you just didn't go down these roads with your car to buy a quart of milk or something like that. Of course we had a cow anyway, so we didn't buy milk. But we bought bread, pectin for jelly, salt, spices, and condiments.    Mr. Aumack: So you didn't bake your own bread, you went and bought it?    Mr. Engebretson: Yes, most of the time we bought it. We had chickens, and we used to take the eggs and candle them. Candling would make sure that they didn't have any spots of blood on the inside. Once in awhile you get chickens that when they lay an egg, the yolk would have some blood in it. And of course, nobody wants to buy an egg like that. Then we would gather the eggs, and about once a week we would go down to A & P in Matawan and trade the eggs in for money to buy groceries. So that was sort of like a barter system that we had. A lot of times the egg shells got very weak. If you handled the egg, it would break. So the answer to that was to go buy some oyster shells and feed it to the chickens, and then their shells would be nice and strong.    Mr. Aumack: They would eat the oyster shells?    Mr. Engebretson: Yes, and the calcium from that would be transferred to the egg.    Mr. Aumack: Was this your father's idea, or was he told this?    Mr. Engebretson: No, this was something that all the farmers did. Do you know Englishtown?    Mr. Aumack: Yes.    Mr. Engebretson: Englishtown, during the 1930s when he moved up here, had an auction. You auctioned everything off. They had a livestock portion where you could buy calves and shoats, which are young pigs. My father bought a shoat. Actually there were two of them. One had a hernia, and the nearest veterinarian was like fifteen miles away. We didn't have money for a vet anyway. So he took a razor blade, cut it open, took a needle and thread, and sewed him up, and made a mixture of Lysol, water, and motor oil. And he put that on the outside. This helped them to heal. In order to raise pigs, especially if they are boars, you want to have them castrated, because otherwise they get big, tough, and nasty. So my father flipped the pig over, cut his testicles out, and put on some Lysol/motor oil mixture. And other farmers thought he was pretty damn good at that, and they asked my father if he would do their hogs, too. So he used to go around and cut all the farmer's hogs. (laughter)    Mr. Aumack: Did they give him some money for doing this?    Mr. Engebretson: Yes, they usually paid him for that.    Mr. Aumack: I have another question, because I am so curious about it. What would he do with the non-used body parts?    Mr. Engebretson: He would just throw them away! (laughter) And I have another interesting story. When you butcher a hog, you really have to know what you are doing. You can shoot him through the head or slit his throat, but to cut him up and do it right, you really should have someone who is an expert. Well there was a colored man, and I am old fashioned so I say "colored." His name was Baltimore, and that's all they called him. He lived in Marlboro Township. My father got in touch with him and told him he had two hogs to kill and butcher. So Baltimore had a truck, and he had a scalder and a tri-pod.    Mr. Aumack: What is a scalder?    Mr. Engebretson: It is a great, big cauldron. It is about six feet long and three and a half feet wide. He had cement blocks that he put this cauldron on, fill it with water and build a fire under it. He would sit and talk, and the fire would really be cooking, and the water would start to boil. Before he was all ready, he would take his killing knives out. They were in a wooden box wrapped in white linen. He was really theatrical. Baltimore was like 350 pounds, and he was all muscle. He would sharpen the knives until they could cut a page from a newspaper.    Mr. Aumack: Was he like six feet five or something like that?    Mr. Engebretson: He must have been about six feet tall. He had a tri-pod, a block-and-tackle, and he had what is called spreaders. You would put the spreaders into the Achilles heels once you kill the animal. You just hoisted them up and dropped them into the scalder and let them sit there for a minute.    Mr. Aumack: Was that to kill him?    Mr. Engebretson: No, that was to get the hair off. But I jumped ahead there. Well, Baltimore had his killing knives. He opened up the box, and it was all white linen. He unwrapped it, very ceremoniously. Then he got out his steel, which looks like a rod and is roughly shaped. He took his knife and went back and forth over this steel, like you may have seen butchers do. Then he said, "Boy, I think this is sharp enough. Do you have a piece of paper?" So I went and got him a newspaper. And he held up the newspaper and slit it in half just like a razorblade, and my eyeballs almost dropped out of my head!    Mr. Aumack: You saw this happen?    Mr. Engebretson: Oh yes, sure. Now the next thing he said was, "I got to have you hold the hog." When you kill a hog, you stick them in the jugular vein. And he had a special knife for that one, and that was the one that was so sharp. My brother was not around, so Baltimore said, "Boy, do you want to hold that hog?" My father was working, so it was up to us, and my brother was not around. He looked at me and said, "Ok, boy, how about you? Are you ready?" And I thought, "Sure, why not?" (laughter)    Mr. Aumack: How old were you?    Mr. Engebretson: About twelve years old.    Mr. Aumack: Oh my gosh! How big was the hog?    Mr. Engebretson: About 150 pounds, easily.    Mr. Aumack: Now how big were you?    Mr. Engebretson: I was probably about 100 pounds. I was a good size.    Mr. Aumack: How tall were you, like four feet?    Mr. Engebretson: No, I was probably closer to five feet.    Mr. Aumack: But still, this thing is quite a bit bigger than you, right?    Mr. Engebretson: Oh yes. Of course I fed them, and they were sort of used to me. I was sort of like their friend, you know.    Mr. Aumack: Oh no! (laughter)    Mr. Engebretson: With friends like that, who needs enemies? (laughter) So I straddled his neck, and I pulled back on his ears. And now his throat was cut.    Mr. Aumack: And he was on his back?    Mr. Engebretson: No, he is standing up. When Baltimore stuck his knife in his jugular vein, it really didn't hurt him. And then the pig walked toward the scalder, Baltimore had a pointed stick he was poking the pig with. When the pig got maybe twenty feet away from the scalder, the hog died. Then Baltimore dragged the hog over to the scalder, put the spreader through the Achilles tendons, hoisted him up, then lowered it down into the scalder, soon it would be hoisted up. Then Baltimore took all the hair off with a curry comb. He curry-combed all the hair off because it was loose after being in the scalder. Then he hoisted the hog up again, and he cut him down the middle. And then with all the entrails spilled out, he was ready to cut the hams and other parts. Baltimore got the head and the guts, which they call chitlins when they are cleaned and fried. I have had them, but I really don't care for them.    Mr. Aumack: What do they taste like?    Mr. Engebretson: Truthfully, they taste exactly like what's inside of them.    Mr. Aumack: Ooh!    Mr. Engebretson: Did you ever eat kidneys? Kidney pie?    Mr. Aumack: No, I haven't.    Mr. Engebretson: If you have kidney pie or eat kidneys, it smells like urine. Anyway, Baltimore got the lights, which are the lungs, the kidneys, the guts to make chitlins, he'd take all the entrails and take everything out to cook it. He also go the head. We got the rest in a week or so if you cut the hog down and cut up the hams, you would bring the hams down to one of our neighbors the Ronsons who had a smokehouse, and Mr. Ronson would smoke the hams for us. The rest of it, all the chops and other parts, we brought down to the Keansburg Cold Storage Locker, because nobody had any kind of freezer in their house. We just didn't have them in those days. You brought the food down to a frozen food locker, and usually they had fish down there, too. So that took care of the killing of the hogs. One of the sports we had…maybe three or four of us would get together, and we all had 22-rifles in those days. That's what you had because you were farmers, and if you saw a woodchuck out there, you shot him.    Mr. Aumack: Now before you get into the rifle games, well actually go ahead and tell me about the games, and then you can tell me about hunting stories, if there are any.    Mr. Engebretson: You had a rifle you always took with you, and we had pistols on the farm, too.    Mr. Aumack: What kind of pistol?    Mr. Engebretson: 22s and 32s. We would go down to any store, anywhere, and tell them we wanted boxes of bullets. And they would say sure and sell them to you.    Mr. Aumack: Now this is when you are thirteen years old?    Mr. Engebretson: Yes- actually, the stores were in villages.    Mr. Aumack: So here you are walking into a general store, and you're thirteen, and you ask him for bullets. Now this is in a town where he knows who you are, right?    Mr. Engebretson: Yes.    Mr. Aumack: Now he knows you like, "Oh, you are so and so's son," right? And you say you want these bullets, and he hands them over to you?    Mr. Engebretson: Sure! Well, you buy them.    Mr. Aumack: Of course.    Mr. Engebretson: You could walk down along the road during gunning season with your shotgun cradled in your arm, and nobody would say a word. Today if you do that, you'll have 36,000 police after you! But everybody owned a rifle, everybody. You graduated from a twenty-two, to a 410, to a twenty gauge, or you jumped right into a sixteen or twelve gauge shotgun. They were usually single barrel, because you couldn't afford the double-barreled shotguns.  But anyway, you could go on any farm and see all the rifles stacked up. Kids didn't shoot each other. During the 1940s, we would go down to Asbury Park. They had the amusement park there. And they had a shooting gallery, where they had tin ducks attached to a moving endless chain. You had a twenty-two pumpgun, which held seventeen shots. It shot live ammunition, and nobody would even think of turning a gun on a crowd and shooting people.    Mr. Aumack: Why not?    Mr. Engebretson: Because you had a different type of person then than you do now. They had very little exposure to violence. You also had a father and mother to give you guidance and discipline.    Mr. Aumack: Now there is all this school violence. So a young kid twelve years old could buy bullets to a gun, and he could buy a gun, right?    Mr. Engebretson: Sure.    Mr. Aumack: Was it expensive for a gun?    Mr. Engebretson: I think at that time, guns were about ten dollars for a single shot 22 rifle.    Mr. Aumack: Now what would that be like today?    Mr. Engebretson: You would probably pay somewhere around seventy-five dollars for the same type of gun.    Mr. Aumack: Would you have your own gun as a child? And your father would have his guns? Or would it be the family's guns?    Mr. Engebretson: No, you would have your own gun. Actually it was my brother who showed me how to use a gun, because my father was always working. He could shoot, because he was in the Army. But either your father or an older brother showed you how to shoot. Once he thought you were sensible enough, you got your own gun. Twelve or thirteen years old.    Mr. Aumack: See that wouldn't happen today. And there are cases where children use guns against each other. Now why was the personality different then?    Mr. Engebretson: Well, I think there are a couple of things. My feeling is that one, you have TV and all the violent games. It shows violence, and you have all these violent games that the kids play, after awhile they get immune to it. They don't realize that it is killing because it is so easy. On a farm, when you shot an animal, you saw it suffer. You saw the blood come out, and you knew it was serious. If you ever shot something that was eating your crop, you shot it so it would be killed immediately. I had a dog that had distemper. We didn't have the money to take him down to the vet.    Mr. Aumack: To be put to sleep?    Mr. Engebretson: Yes. I took my shotgun, patted him on the head, and blew him away.    Mr. Aumack: Did you like your dog?    Mr. Engebretson: Oh, I loved him. And I cried and cried.    Mr. Aumack: Did your father tell you to take the dog out back and shoot him?    Mr. Engebretson: No, Dad told me the dog was very sick. Dad told me he didn't know what I wanted to do, but that he would never let any animal suffer. So I shot the dog, buried him, and put up a cross. You knew what suffering was, and you shot it because you needed to put it out of its misery. Today kids get their thrills by going up and taking a gun out and shooting a person. They have no responsibility. The other factor is when you have your mother and father both out of the house working, there is nobody there when you need them to tell you what to do. There is no guidance. I'll tell you my take on things. Today the mother and father have to work. And why do they have to work? Because fifty percent of our income is taxed. When you have income taxed at fifty percent, you have to scale down your living until the children are born. Then the mother goes out to work for that nicer car or whatever. We need to stop taxing people at fifty-percent and let the mother be at home. I also think you can't have five fathers in a family. You have got to have one father, and not five. If you have five, usually none of them are there at all to give you any kind of guidance. And then you look at your mother, and you think what a mess this is, and you wonder if you are ever going to get out of this. I have been in schools where kids have so-called alternative education for high school students, where you have kids that are bad news. There would be five of them in a class, the teacher would read the newspaper, and the kids would be talking with each other. The teacher gets paid sixty thousand dollars a year, and the kids learn nothing. Now they get out of high school and get ready for a job. But they don't have any skills, and they can't read or do any kind of mathematics. And what happens is you get a kid who doesn't even like himself. If you don't like yourself, you're not going to like any other person. If you have no respect, you will walk up to this other person, and tell him to give you his money. And if he looks at you cross-eyed, you have such a low opinion of yourself,  that you will blow him away. This whole thing has to change. It has to get back to the point where people have skills, and they are proud of themselves, and they know things. One other thing is we have a President that is a disgrace. We want people to look up to the President and be like him. Reagan was one that you could look at and know he was really an example of what a President should be. When he went into the Oval Office, he had his suit coat on with a tie. When our current President came into the office, the first thing he did was lower his pants and have Monica Lewinsky do a job on him. How can you look up to him or have respect? How can you say that is the type of person I want to be? You can't. Actually, I think it really came in about the 1960s, when I was teaching. We used to read from the Bible. We used to have the flag salute. When I taught in 1961, you came in with a jacket. You came in with a tie. If you wanted a beer, you went to another town so that no parent or child would see you walking out of the bar. You didn't strike because you were a professional. Today you look at some of the teachers, and the way some of them dress is a disgrace. When you act like a union member and you strike, how can anybody have respect for you? There has to be a big change in America. Our one hope is that we have a lot of people coming in who are immigrants, who are now doing the lousy, dirty work that none of our kids will do. The Mexicans and Asians are a few of those immigrants. They come in not even knowing the language, and they work their butts off to get ahead. They are good citizens. Part of our present population wants reparations for something that happened 300 years ago. It is an "I want something for nothing" mindset. Why not seek reparation from the African chieftains who sold the natives into slavery?    Mr. Aumack: Are you talking about the slaves?    Mr. Engebretson: Yes.    Mr. Aumack: Let's go back to education because there is a very strong contrast between farm kids taking off school to spray the orchards, and buying bullets and guns at twelve years old. You were talking about your education career. Tell me about what you think of the Colts Neck education system, or the system you were involved in, now as opposed to what it is was like then?    Mr. Engebretson: When I went to school, it was rather interesting. You had the three major subjects: reading, writing, and arithmetic. We didn't have much in the way of science but then we were on a farm, and we learned about birth, seeds growing, and protection of the environment.    Mr. Aumack: Well you learned about birth firsthand with the cows, right?    Mr. Engebretson: Sure, they were born right in front of you. It was my job once a year to get the cow serviced (bred). We had one cow, and I would go down to our neighbor's farm, who had a bull. I had to walk my cow about three miles down, get her serviced, and then come back.    Mr. Aumack: Serviced by the bull?    Mr. Engebretson: Yes. About seven months later, she had a calf. You would watch her to make sure that the calf came out right. My father usually was there, and my mother was always there. And you learned about those type of things even though you didn't have formal science classes. I can tell you, by the time we got out of eighth grade, we knew math upside down. We were ready for high school math. The advantage of being in a class where you had two grades was that if you were younger and got through with your lesson early, you could listen to the next grade up recite their lesson. The teacher would say you could listen as long as you did your work. By the time you got through graduating from the lower grade to that one class to the upper grade, you were well prepared academically.    Mr. Aumack: So in a way, you could set up your own little schedule. If you were happy at the pace you were going, that was fine, and you weren't discouraged or anything. But if you worked ahead, it was even better. Now what about those that lagged behind, what did they do about those children?    Mr. Engebretson: Usually the kids who were a little slower got a lot of help from the teacher or from other students.    Mr. Aumack: So it was good, personal help that was meaningful.    Mr. Engebretson: Oh yes, definitely. We were all avid readers, and that is one of the things we had. You didn't really read comic books, but we had what was called the Big Little Books. They were books that were about two inches thick. You could buy those down in the stationery stores. Everybody used to read, and loved to talk about the stories. Today you don't see a whole lot of that, except for Harry Potter. Now that, to me, is really great where you have an author who can turn the kids on to reading. But in those days, you especially read the newspapers, too, because this was during the War. We read about what was happening in Asia and Europe. We were interested in it.    Mr. Aumack: So you were encouraged by your teachers to read about what was going on in the world?    Mr. Engebretson: Yes. And this was pretty much what happened in school. You had your basics, and you didn't have foreign languages, shop, or home economics. You got that in high school.    Mr. Aumack: Did you get history in grammar school?    Mr. Engebretson: Yes.    Mr. Aumack: What else did you read?    Mr. Engebretson: Geography, biographies, and stories.    Mr. Aumack: What stories?    Mr. Engebretson: One would be Tarzan, and there were stories about other persons that you could read. Once in awhile, you would get a comic book. But your parents really didn't want you to read comic books.    Mr. Aumack: Why? Was that looked upon then like some people now think about television?    Mr. Engebretson: It had a lot of pictures. They wanted us to read words and not spend most of our time looking at the pictures.    Mr. Aumack: So you could use your own mind and imagination.    Mr. Engebretson: Yes. Then we had radio. Radio was good because you had programs like "The Inner Sanctum,"  which were mysteries.    Mr. Aumack: What was it about?    Mr. Engebretson: Usually it was about a murder or other crimes, and they were catching the people who did it. The bad guy always got caught. They had "The Green Hornet," on the radio, and that was the same thing. It was never anybody shooting and gasping for breath. The criminals were always were caught.    Mr. Aumack: So there weren't any shootings in the stories?    Mr. Engebretson: Well there was some in "The Lone Ranger." He would ride after the bad guys and shoot them, but usually it was in the leg.    Mr. Aumack: So the criminal would say something like, "Oh no, I have been shot in the leg" or something like that?    Mr. Engebretson: Yes, that's how it went. "Good work, Tonto!" (laughter)    Mr. Aumack: There is a comedy routine by Bill Cosby that says every time the Lone Ranger asked Tonto to go into town, Tonto would always get beat up. Now tell us about that.    Mr. Engebretson: Most of the time he would say, "Tonto, we need some supplies." So Tonto would say, "Ok, Kemo Sabe. I am going to town." And Tonto would come back and you couldn't tell that he was all beat up, but the Lone Ranger would say, "Tonto, what happened to you?" And Tonto would say, "Three men jumped me, Kemo Sabe." (laughter)    Mr. Aumack: Did this occur in every episode, where he got beat up?    Mr. Engebretson: Not every one, they sort of spaced them out or else the poor guy wouldn't be able to ride his horse very much. (laughter) But all of the programs had the same theme. The good guys came out best and you didn't have everybody shot through the head or anything like that. They shot in the arm or leg, and they captured them and tied them up. They never really went into a routine of people being hanged, so there was no death involved. You could use your own imagination though, but the programs all had a moral value, as did your schoolbooks. McGuffey's Readers, which were used from the 1860s to about 1900, all had a moral. It was all patriotic, and the good guys always came out best and the bad guys lost. And we seem to have lost that type of story in the schools today, too.    Mr. Aumack: Why have we, in your opinion?    Mr. Engebretson: Again, I think that the people who write the books have a responsibility, and they haven't lived up to it. They have changed history, some of the books written about World War II. They seem to put us in the place of killers of women and children in Hiroshima. They don't say that we gave them three days notice to leave because we were going to destroy their city. And then when it happened, it was devastating. The authors try to place the blame on us. It seems like if you read the social studies books, it really downplays the Japanese who attacked Pearl Harbor for no reason.    Mr. Aumack: You mean it really gives them a break?    Mr. Engebretson: Yes. During the 1930s, the Japanese were buying scrap metal by the tons, by the shiploads. And they weren't making toys out of it. They were building their Army, Navy, and Air Force. Nothing is ever mentioned in the history books about this. When you look at some of the books used in our schools today, the morals are not spelled out. I think that there has to be something done with them instilling patriotism and morals in these school books, and also accurately portraying what has happened with our history.    Mr. Aumack: What in your mind has been inaccurately portrayed?    Mr. Engebretson: Well especially Hiroshima. We were pictured as heartless and cruel, like we just dropped the bomb with all the people there, and we just maimed and killed them. That is not right. They should get their facts straight. And they should also mention that we didn't start the War. The Japanese started the War. There was no warning when they came and bombed Pearl Harbor.    Mr. Aumack: That's true.    Mr. Engebretson: And I resent that. Very little is printed on those facts. Do you ever read in your history books about the Bataan Death March?    Mr. Aumack: No.    Mr. Engebretson: No. Thousands of American soldiers, sailors, and nurses died. But you don't read about that. It happened though. And yet you hear about Hiroshima time and time again.    Mr. Aumack: Yes, I remember about Hiroshima but don't know about the Death March.    Mr. Engebretson: The Japanese had a method of torture during the Death March. It was to sharpen a bamboo sapling that was growing in the ground. They would just cut the sapling, and they would set a prisoner on that stake by their rectum. They would do that to whomever they didn't like. And nobody ever tells about that. Did they ever mention that they would pull out their fingernails?    Mr. Aumack: And where have you learned this?    Mr. Engebretson: During the War in the newspapers.    Mr. Aumack: So people read this in the newspaper?    Mr. Engebretson: Sure. And truthfully, there was hatred. And probably propaganda was meant to create that hatred.    Mr. Aumack: Do you know of any propaganda or anything that was said that was false against the Japanese, that we know now is untrue?    Mr. Engebretson: It is hard to prove.    Mr. Aumack: So not to play Devil's Advocate on purpose, but would this staking people on bamboo be true?    Mr. Engebretson: This is first-hand accounts from the men who came back, so it is true.    Mr. Aumack: So these men were in the Death March and managed to live, and they would tell you what happened to some of the other men.    Mr. Engebretson: Yes. People are cruel to each other. We are cruel today to each other. I inspect schools for safety, and I saw something happen in East Orange. I was parked at a stop sign, and I heard all this shouting and cursing. I looked over, and there was a group of maybe a half-dozen black people. They were cursing at each other, and one guy smacked the other in the mouth. In my day if you smacked somebody in the mouth, they would go down, and you would walk away. Or maybe you would say, "Do you want another one?" But this guy walked over to him and with his feet, he stomped the guy's face. And the other people were cheering. I just looked and thought, "Oh God, what is this world coming to?" In my day, if you acted smart, you got a smack in the mouth, and maybe you got a couple of teeth knocked out. But you probably deserved it, and the other guy took pity on you and would walk away. It's not that way today. When people grow up and watch television and see all this violence, they just become immune to it.    Mr. Aumack: Some people see Vietnam soldiers with their wounded and their cries, and they are immune to it. Is this because they have played video games and think it's like the same thing?    Mr. Engebretson: A good part of it is, yes. They think death is just another event. They see it on television. They see a guy during a war blow somebody's brains out in front of the camera, and they think it's not a big deal. They don't have a good concept about what life and death is, and it's a shame.    Mr. Aumack: Let's get to your Korean War experiences. I have seen numerous memoirs lately, because Korea is having a fifty-year anniversary. So tell me how you got into that War.    Mr. Engebretson: As I said, my father was in World War I, and my brother was in World War II. And the Korean War came along, and I thought this was something that I should do for my country. So I joined.    Mr. Aumack: So you enlisted?    Mr. Engebretson: Yes. I was in for four years, but I didn't get over to Korea. I was in the Seebees on the East Coast, and we were attached to the Second Marines. I was in ACB2.    Mr. Aumack: What is a CB and an ACB?    Mr. Engebretson: ACB is an amphibious CB. And a CB is a Construction Battalion. And probably I got into that because I was a farmer and I knew mechanics, etc. I wound up as a mechanic on a jeep and a duck.    Mr. Aumack: What is a duck?    Mr. Engebretson: A duck is the one that goes out into the water, and it can go on land, also. It has a little propeller in the back, and it would go down the beach. It is just a big vehicle with tires and a propeller in the back, and it's shaped like a bathtub. You would go from the beach right into the water, and the propellers started working, and away you would go like a boat. Now that was fun. So I was a mechanic for four years. One of my friends I went to school with, he was just the nicest guy. His name was Henry Bratigaum. I read about it in the paper that he was in one of the landings, and he got it right in the head. He wasn't on the shore any amount of time at all. And I thought, "What a tragedy!" Here was a guy who wouldn't hurt a fly, and he was drafted in the Army, and he got it.    Mr. Aumack: Did he enlist?    Mr. Engebretson: No, he was drafted.    Mr. Aumack: Now what landing was this?    Mr. Engebretson: I am not sure what landing that was in the Korean War. But I read about it, and it was really sad. He was a nice guy, and he had a nice family. The thing that bothers me the most is that we never learn. We had World War I, and we were going to have a League of Nations that was going to be the answer. We had World War II, and that was the United Nations that was going to be the answer. And that was going to be the end of all wars. And then we had the Korean War. When I was with my wife out in the Elder Hostel for the Church of Latter Day Saints tracing our ancestors, there was one class that was talking about memoirs. I said I would probably do something about my days in the Korean War. And the instructor said that wasn't really a war. And I said, "Let me tell you something." And there were a bunch of people there about my age. I said, "Tell that to the 56,000 people who were killed!" I said, "Tell them it wasn't a war!" He said I was right.    Mr. Aumack: I am not defending them, but people say that because they technically are calling it more of a police action. And that's what I learned. They don't call it a "war" because a war wasn't "officially declared." But I agree with you, sir.    Mr. Engebretson: Any war you have where you kill people, it is a war. I think the people are so tired of unnecessary wars that when the people from Vietnam came back home, people were just fed up with it. They didn't want any war. We haven't learned our lesson. The President is a draft dodger. And what he did was to send our airplanes, not our troops, to Kosovo. There we bombed women and children…for peace. You read the papers today, and tell me if there is any peace there. There is not.    Mr. Aumack: What do you think he should have done, sent troops?    Mr. Engebretson: I think he should have left it to the Europeans because that is in their backyard. Are we going to accept people coming from Europe over to here and tell us how we are going to handle our riots? No, you let those people take care of it. And that is unless the European community asks us to come in. But thank God he is going, so we don't have to have something like that again. But we didn't have any wars with Reagan, did we?    Mr. Aumack: No, not to my knowledge. Let's discuss more about the education system. What else can we get into?    Mr. Engebretson: Well, I can tell you about my education system. My brother was six years older than I. By the time I got into high school, he was a very good student. He was perfect in everything, and I am sort of sloppy. As long as I get by, that's ok with me. Well a couple of teachers at the high school asked me why I wasn't like my brother.    Mr. Aumack: What was your brother's name, by the way?    Mr. Engebretson: Ed. I heard this comment about three or four times, and I was in my junior year when I just decided that was all I could take. And so I quit school. And my Mom persisted in telling me not to quit school, but I wanted to join the Navy. So I joined the Navy. I loved mechanic work at that time, and I still like it. I couldn't go to mechanics school in California. I asked why, they said because I was a high school dropout.  Well, when I got out, I got my high school equivalency diploma. I went to Monmouth Junior College, which was meeting in the high school in Long Branch. I took two courses, and I got Bs in both of them. I was working as a planker for Henry Luhrs, who was a boat manufacturer in Morgan. We had a layoff. I thought maybe I would try to go to college.  I had taken two courses, and I enrolled. I had the GI Bill. Otherwise, I couldn't really have afforded it. So I took four courses, I think, and got As. I met a girl whose brother was working for Hercules or Dupont where they make film. He was a custodian for that company, and he was going to NYU. I thought if he could go to NYU, why couldn't I go to college? So I went full-time to Monmouth College. I studied, and I studied high school English at the same time I was taking college English. I worked with my father on the farm. I was taking twenty-one credit hours, and I wound up getting my degree a year early. I made the Dean's List five out of six times, and was given the Outstanding Student Award. I had a year left and went to the University of Pennsylvania, and finished there a two-year program in one and a half years. I went on to get a Masters from Newark State College.    Mr. Aumack: In what?    Mr. Engebretson: In education. I have one Masters in Business from Wharton School, and I have a Specialist Degree from Rutgers University in Administration Supervision. So I sort of proved to myself that I could do it. Anybody can do it if you really want to. The story of my education in Matawan, when I finished about two years at Monmouth, I applied for a substitute certificate. And they sent the application to my brother. (laughter) And later I became one of the members of the Board of Education in Matawan.    Mr. Aumack: What year did you become a member of the Board?    Mr. Engebretson: 1967 to 1970.    Mr. Aumack: What was the schooling like in 1967?    Mr. Engebretson: It is interesting. At that period of time, we were going through a change in education.    Mr. Aumack: What kind of change?    Mr. Engebretson: Open classrooms.    Mr. Aumack: What do you mean by that?    Mr. Engebretson: They thought that instead of having individual classrooms, you should open up the whole school. You should build the school to accommodate interaction between the students, and they had the concept of team teaching.  So we developed the school into three schools, which had that type of education. And then after we did this, the teachers disliked the concept in Matawan. At first the teachers thought it was great. They went out to Illinois with us, came back and developed a whole plan. And then after it was built, those same teachers decided they didn't like it anymore.    Mr. Aumack: Did they quit?    Mr. Engebretson: No, we built partitions to separate it into individual classrooms again.    Mr. Aumack: Did that ever happen anywhere else in New Jersey that you know of?    Mr. Engebretson: Probably.    Mr. Aumack: But you don't remember any specific places offhand?    Mr. Engebretson: No.    Mr. Aumack: What did you teach when you were a teacher?    Mr. Engebretson: I started to teach in Old Bridge Township in the middle of the year. I had a fifth grade class. After that, I taught fifth grade science and social studies and then later the same subjects in sixth and seventh grades. Then I went on to Farmingdale, where I was the Principal there. I went to Marlboro Township, and I had bigger and better experiences in my life. And they were good experiences.    Mr. Aumack: Were you ever a teacher or administrator in Colts Neck?    Mr. Engebretson: No.    Mr. Aumack: Discuss the Marlboro education system then compared to the way it is now.    Mr. Engebretson: I have been away from it for quite awhile, but the people whom I know are good people. They are current as far as innovations and curriculum go. They have a fellow named Tom Nicola, who is the head of curriculum department. He is excellent. The teachers for the most part are pretty good. One thing that I don't agree with in the school system is the middle school concept.    Mr. Aumack: Why?    Mr. Engebretson: I don't think they need shop.    Mr. Aumack: Wood shop?    Mr. Engebretson: Yes. I think it's a waste of time. If you really want to know something, you can learn it on Saturday, or watch your father, or wait until high school to take shop. But we need to build the educational foundation in middle school. We need more computers, and the kids need to become computer literate. They need to read, write, and understand and do mathematics. I look at some of the kids who work at checkout counters, and they get absolutely fogged out if their electricity goes out or something happens to their cash register. Middle school shop and home economics is not really necessary. Do you really need to have home economics for the children at middle school? They can take that in high school. You should have the middle school as the basis for your high school. We need to build the kids knowledge so that they are proficient in math, science, social studies, and language arts.    Mr. Aumack: Are you saying that home economics is a not bad thing, but if they want to learn about something like that, they should do it in their spare time?    Mr. Engebretson: Sure. If anything, learn foreign languages in the middle school instead of having a semester or quarter in shop or home economics. I don't really see the value.    Mr. Aumack: We are in Colts Neck right now. Do you know about the zoning regulations around here?    Mr. Engebretson: Somewhat.    Mr. Aumack: Tell me about what you think of the zoning regulations?    Mr. Engebretson: I know that the mini farms have five-acre minimums.    Mr. Aumack: Here?    Mr. Engebretson: No, this is like one and a half acres here. In order to preserve the pastoral complexity here, we have five-acre mini farms. They haven't developed any strip malls, which is good. We can go to another town and shop, if we have to. The schools I think are pretty good. One thing that I resent is the voting for new schools. They say it is going to cost you x amount of dollars for the bond. But if you are really going to be truthful, then tell the voters the total amount which would include the additional teachers, custodians, counselors, and anyone else who is needed. As it is, you are not going to see the additional people hired on until you get your tax bill.     Mr. Aumack: So it will be a lot higher than what they thought they were going to be paying?    Mr. Engebretson: That's right.    Mr. Aumack: So a lot of people in Colts Neck feel cheated?    Mr. Engebretson: Some felt that they were misled.    Mr. Aumack: Was this the bill over Colts Neck High School?    Mr. Engebretson: No.    Mr. Aumack: So this was the vote that built Freehold Regional School then?    Mr. Engebretson: This one I am talking about was the one that was added on to Conover Road School up here and over at Cedar Drive School. And you don't mind paying for something if somebody tells you the full truth  you can accept that. In order to have additions put on schools, like an all-purpose room, you have to have bleachers, cabinets, and everything else associated with it. Just put it all down, and let the people know everything and not just part of the cost. Next time a referendum comes up for a vote, the people will feel like they weren't told everything and will vote against the items. People like my wife and myself, who were in education, realize the importance of schools, but it's just the idea that you are being told half-truths that isn't good public relations.    Mr. Aumack: And some people may not even vote because they know they can't trust them, even if it would be the truth, right?    Mr. Engebretson: Yes. Well it's the same thing with the government, you know. Senior citizens cry and moan about the cost of prescription drugs. And the AARP is always saying you have to have this and that. And not one of them will ever ask why we gave six billion to the Palestinians since Camp David every year, and why did we give six billion to Israel, and why did we give hundred of millions of dollars to Africa to fight AIDS? Our people here have cancer. My wife just got through with radiation treatments. She didn't bring it on herself. Africa did  -- with fornication. If you are going to help, help us first.    Mr. Aumack: Take care of home before you go out.    Mr. Engebretson: Yes. And how many billions of dollars did it cost to bomb Kosovo? Help our people first, and then be generous to the rest of the world. And I really get annoyed about that type of thing. You can't do anything about it. Once the politicians decide they are going to do it, they are going to do it.    Mr. Aumack: How can any Colts Neck resident preserve the environment that it has now?    Mr. Engebretson: I think they are doing it. They have a good Mayor and Council. What they are doing is to preserve it as some sort of an agricultural township. So they are limiting the number of houses that are coming in. And they are building a senior citizen's complex for assisted living. They aren't saying you can't have assisted living, but let's have a plan. They don't want house upon house upon house. You notice we don't have sidewalks here. We have our own well for water, and we have our own septic tanks. So we don't have city water, we don't have city sewers, and we don't have sidewalks. There are no streetlights. And you might think this is primitive, but it is not. It is rural, and this is the type of thing we want to have and the type of community in which we want to live.    Mr. Aumack: That's very different from me. I live in a one-square mile town, Fair Haven, and we have streetlights, and my family just took out the huge oil tank from the backyard. So it varies from town to town.    Mr. Engebretson: Well, we do have gas here. And we have electricity. But we don't have to worry about a monthly charge for water or for sewer.    Mr. Aumack: And that's something that other towns would tax on, right?    Mr. Engebretson: Yes. You have to pay the water bill to Consolidated Water or whatever it is called, and you have to pay a sewer bill to the utility company. Usually if you have a municipal authority, if you use ten gallons of water, they figure you use a gallon of sewage. So the two are tied together. But here we can use as much water as we want. And that is one of the advantages here. Some people might complain about not having sidewalks, but how often do you use them? If you really want a sidewalk, put it in front of your house. Nobody is stopping you. You just get a permit and build a sidewalk.    Mr. Aumack: What has changed in your life in Monmouth County?    Mr. Engebretson: There have been a lot of changes going on. Marlboro is a good example of a lot of changes. People complain that the farms aren't there any more, and I look back and reminisce. But I can't really feel sorry, because people have to live some place. They want to get out of the cities. So they come out here. That's one side of the coin. The other side of the coin is my parents were farmers. As the years went by, the cost of fertilizer tripled and quadrupled. My father bought a tractor in 1945, and that same tractor would be ten times the cost today. You usually paid people to pick by the basket, but now you have to pay them by the hour. So the equipment went up, the labor went up, the fertilizer went up, and your taxes went up. The labor supply is not abundant like it used to be. So the farmer looks at his land and thinks some people make fifty thousand dollars a year, and I make maybe twenty thousand dollars a year and more with all my expenses. This same farmer is now sixty-five years old. Shouldn't he be allowed to sell his land? A developer comes along and says he'll give him seventy-five thousand an acre. And the farmer thinks that's not too bad, especially for highway frontage. So the farmer thinks maybe he should sell and enjoy the good life. Or should he put the land in escrow and get someone to farm it for him and get ten thousand dollars a year for the rental? No--let's sell land.    Mr. Aumack: He is going to go for the higher price from the developer.    Mr. Engebretson: Why not? All his life he has paid taxes, has supported the local, state and federal government, and isn't it about time the farmer makes the money he should? If you have a business and decide to sell it because you are tired of working and not making a good profit, who should tell you that you can't sell it? Now if the government offers to give the farmer the same amount of money as the developer, then fine, buy the land. Whoever has the money wins. The problem the farmers have right now is that he should sell and retire or continue farming. You are going to find more and more small farmers going out of business and selling. There is another side to this. Some farmers are going to specialize in crops, they may grow herbs, flowers, or sod, which is not as labor intensive. You'll find that some farmers may have found a niche.    Mr. Aumack: Your father used to be an ironworker in New York City?    Mr. Engebretson: Yes.    Mr. Aumack: Where did he work in New York City?    Mr. Engebretson: They were building high rise apartments and skyscrapers going up in New York City, and on Long Island.    Mr. Aumack: So he was building some of the first skyscrapers you mean?    Mr. Engebretson: Yes. And that was dangerous. There were no safety belts, and you walked the beams thirty or forty stories up.    Mr. Aumack: Did he ever tell you anything about anyone ever falling off?    Mr. Engebretson: He told me a couple of people that he knew fell off, yes. He also worked in the Navy yard in Brooklyn, New York. He was one of nine children. When he was twelve years old, they didn't have enough food for the entire family, so he had to go out and work as a baker's helper. He lived at the bakery and gave his earnings to his father to help support the family. At fifteen years old, he went to sea as a cook on a ship, a coal freighter out of Liverpool.    Mr. Aumack: And he moved down to the farm to help make sure you were well and to make a fresh start?     Mr. Engebretson: Well he was still working, but it was mainly for me with my health problems that we moved to the farm. The things that you learn on a farm are pretty neat. The owners of the farm were really nice people. They used to come up on the weekends, and they always wanted to have two or three dressed chickens. They would make chicken cacciatore, etc. I would have to kill the chickens, pluck and got them.    Mr. Aumack: Now this was when you were twelve or thirteen years old?    Mr. Engebretson: Yes. Now my brother was in the Merchant Marines then. So I would chop the head off the chicken, and it would flop all around. Then I would get a bucket of boiling water and stick it in, and then strip all the feathers off. Then I would open it up and take all the entrails out.    Mr. Aumack: The chitlins, right?    Mr. Engebretson: No, those aren't chitlins.    Mr. Aumack: What do you call those?    Mr. Engebretson: Just intestines. Then they have something called a crop, and it grinds up the food using the stones inside. It grinds up all the food before it goes to the intestines.    Mr. Aumack: Oh, the crop was a body part of the chicken.    Mr. Engebretson: Yes. They call it a gizzard. Well, you just don't go out and grab hold of a chicken by the neck and say, "Sorry, this is your day!" (laughter)    Mr. Aumack: Well, how do you do it then?    Mr. Engebretson: When we bought chickens, we bought them from Pennsylvania Hatchery, as day-old chicks. They came in a box. You could order pullets, which are all females, or cockerels, which are the males. They usually came in the wintertime, and you put them under your stove to keep them nice and warm. Then you would put them in the brooder, out in the chicken house. The brooder has a light bulb underneath that keeps them nice and warm. Then they start to grow. They eat all the food that you have given them. Some day you have to look at each one and ask if they are productive. Well, how do you tell since they all look the same? You flip up the chicken so its neck is pointing down, and there would be like pelvic bone like those on a human being. Now the females lay eggs. If you can put three fingers between their pelvic bones, which is where the egg comes from through, it is a good layer. But two fingers means it is time to go. So that is the one that you grab hold of to kill for food. That is called "culling the chickens." For years and years I never knew how they found out whether a baby chick was a male or a female.    Mr. Aumack: How did they know?    Mr. Engebretson: I inspected a school down in South Jersey. As this custodian and I were talking about farms. He lives on a farm. We started talking about culling the chickens, and I told him how I never understood how they knew the difference between a male and female chick so he told me. He once worked in a hatchery. They had Japanese workers who came from the West Coast, and they lived in South Jersey. They were in west coast concentration camps, and were moved to south Jersey to keep an eye on them during World War II. The hatchery incubators hatch the eggs. They had high school students come in with big boxes of chicks that were just hatched. Two boxes were sitting in front of the Japanese worker. They had thick glasses like they use for gemstones. They would grab hold of a chick and open up its legs. You and I have a navel when we are born. We get our nourishment from the placenta. A chick has almost the same thing, except it is called an egg yolk sack. When it is born, that drops off. But if you spread the legs and it has one dot, it's a pullet. And if it has two dots, it is a cockerel. And they would separate them out from each other into boxes. There is ninety-five percent accuracy in determining sex. I asked what they called these workers, and the custodian said they were called chick sexers. I wondered if he was pulling my leg, so I went down to the library and went to the dictionary of occupational titles, and there it was. A chick sexer is a person who determines the sex of a chick when they are born.    Mr. Aumack: How do you kill a chicken?    Mr. Engebretson: There are a couple of ways, but I didn't like to slit their throat because it would get blood all over. I grabbed the chicken by the legs, and I would tuck one wing on the left side of the leg and take the other wing and tuck it alongside the other leg. Now they are held in one hand. I used a chopping block, and I would rap the chicken's head on the chopping block, just to stun him. I would give him a chop with the hatchet, and I'd have to make sure my hand wasn't in the way. I had a peach basket, and I would put him in there to flop around. They really can't get out of there, so they flopped around and bled.    Mr. Aumack: So you knocked them out to stun them and then you cut its head off?    Mr. Engebretson: Yes. I don't like to look at a chicken's eyes when I'm doing it! He was thinking, "You used to be my friend. You fed me every day!" (laughter)    Mr. Aumack: I have heard stories about them running around. Can they run around?    Mr. Engebretson: They don't have a head anymore, so they can't see where they are going. So the involuntary muscles make them flop around. In about thirty seconds or so, they are all through.    Mr. Aumack: Tell me something that you would tell to the younger generation on how to preserve Monmouth County and any advice you may have for them about anything.    Mr. Engebretson: You can preserve Monmouth County to a certain extent. I think what the State has done by buying farms is a good idea. The County has done quite a bit. If you go around to the County parks, on Route 537, it is still farmed.  It is leased to the farmers, and they grow hay and grain on it. You have to balance what you have in the way of nature as opposed to what your needs are. People lose sight of that. In California especially, they have a type of butterfly that is only indigenous to there. It is nice to see it, but some day that butterfly is not going to have a home. What will happen is, he'll probably fly off to the next farm down the road. And you don't have to condemn that land for butterflies. So you have to use common sense. If you have low lands, you don't build on them. Don't fill it in. Let the frogs and birds stay there. But if you have good farmland, you either farm it or sell it for houses. Also you don't build right near the ocean. These people that build near the ocean get federal insurance. They shouldn't receive federal flood insurance. They are building too close. And they are apt to have their homes swept away. We should not have our tax dollars used to support the federal flood insurance in this case.    Mr. Aumack: Well, I think this is a good place to stop. I thank you, and it has been a pleasure and an honor, sir.    Mr. Engebretson: Thank you.   
MonmouthCounty;Daniel W. Dorn;1910;2000;Daniel W. Dorn, 1910, 2000        Remembering The 20th Century: An Oral History of Monmouth County      Daniel Dorn, Sr., 1940  Date of Interview: September 20, 2000  Name of Interviewer: Gloria Stravelli  Premises of Interview: 23 Wallace Street, Red Bank, NJ  Birthdate of Subject: September 2, 1910    Ms. Stravelli: Were you born in Monmouth County?    Mr. Dorn: Yes, Asbury Park.    Ms. Stravelli: And was your dad already a photographer? He had the theater there, didn't he? The Nickelodeon?    Mr. Dorn: Well, he had all kinds of businesses. He was an innovator. He ran the first Nickelodeon in Asbury Park. You know what a Nickelodeon was?    Ms. Stravelli: A machine that you looked in?    Mr. Dorn: No, it was a moving picture house and you paid a nickel and you saw the show for ten minutes and then you went out and another group of people went in. He ran the projector. It was like a small movie theater. They called them Nickelodeons. Then he had a vulcanizing business where he repaired tires and actually built tires. This was in about 1905 or 1906.    Ms. Stravelli: Where was he born?    Mr. Dorn: My Dad was born in Georgia. East Point, Georgia.    Ms. Stravelli: His middle name is DuBouchet, right? Do I remember that correctly?    Mr. Dorn: That's his middle name. It's French. There were two theaters in Red Bank and they wanted to try to form a union of the stage hands and operators. And they were one man short, so a person my Dad was acquainted with got him to come to Red Bank as a projectionist in one of the theaters so that they could start the union.    Ms. Stravelli: Was that the Strand?     Mr. Dorn: The Strand and the Empire. You wouldn't remember the Empire. The Empire was a theater right across from the Savings and Loan place on Monmouth Street  it was this little one story thing, and it was a moving picture theater and vaudeville. He started in the Strand theater, but then they got him to move to the Empire and operate the projectors and the spotlight there for the stage performances, the vaudeville. The theater had a flat roof, and right along side of the theater was a Sears Roebuck, which had a sharp angled roof. They had about eighteen inches of snow one night, and it was a wet snow, so it clung to the roof. When it thawed, it slid onto the theater and brought the whole thing down. So that was the end of that!    Ms. Stravelli: Were you already working with your Dad when you were a young boy?    Mr. Dorn: Well, I was only seven years old then, and I used to come up and visit him. But at that time Red Bank was very different than it is now.    Ms. Stravelli: Now, did you live in Red Bank at the time?    Mr. Dorn: Dad moved up here in 1916  that's when he came up to help form the union and project in the theater. I was born in Asbury Park, and when I was six years old, in 1916, we moved to Red Bank. I was born in 1910. I used to come up and visit. Monmouth Street had trolley tracks and the streets were all brick.    Ms. Stravelli: Cobblestones?    Mr. Dorn: Yes, Belgian block, they called them  they were like over-sized bricks. I think, at that time, Broad Street was too, until they tore it all up and paved it. When I was here the trolleys were operating  they replaced the horse and buggy for transportation.    Ms. Stravelli: They ran on Monmouth?    Mr. Dorn: They ran to Rumson, Sea Bright, Long Branch…    Ms. Stravelli: Did the trolley go down to Asbury?    Mr. Dorn: I think it did. Asbury had trolleys. I think, as a matter of fact, they went all the way down the shore to the Sea Girt area. You could go all the way to Trenton by trolley. You had to go to Perth Amboy by trolley, and then they had a high speed trolley that went to Trenton from Perth Amboy. That trolley era only lasted maybe eight years or so, and then the busses replaced the trolleys  that's when they paved over Broad Street and Monmouth Street on top of the tracks. In fact, on Broad Street they dug up the tracks during World War I for the metal - to get the metal to make arms and things. I remember that.    Ms. Stravelli: You went to school in Red Bank?    Mr. Dorn: Yes. When we came, the road we lived on, Pinckney Road, was a dirt road. It was about a quarter of a mile long, so they used to have sulky races right in front of our house, from one end of Pinckney Road to the other. You know with their little carts, like at Freehold Raceway.    Ms. Stravelli: Did you have brothers and sisters?    Mr. Dorn: Yes, I had one brother and one sister.    Ms. Stravelli: And when Dad was the projectionist, had he started doing the newsreels yet?    Mr. Dorn: No. He was a field cameraman for Fox News. In other words, they'd assign him, they'd give him work as a steady photographer, they'd send him on assignments, like if they wanted to send a crew down to photograph the ice boats, for a special, he'd make all the arrangements. He got me a card so I could be a cameraman. For a couple years I was a field representative.    Ms. Stravelli: So did you see any important events?    Mr. Dorn: I saw about five or six big houses in Sea Bright go down. Remember the big storms? We photographed that right while the storm was on. I remember that the big old-fashioned cameras were heavy and they had a tripod, and I'd try to get it set up, and it would be in the sand. It would sink down in the sand and I had to hold onto it. And you had to grind it with a hand crank.    Ms. Stravelli: Did you learn your photography skills from your father?    Mr. Dorn: Oh, yes. I'd go in there and help him and just learn. I learned to be a projectionist - I always had a job, he always had a job for me. After the Empire collapsed, he worked for a while in the Strand, and then they built the Carlton Theater, which is now the Count Basie Theater. We stayed in Red Bank, but his job was in Belmar. He took charge of seven theaters, going to the city to pick up seven shows, and then they'd rotate through the chain. Seven theaters was a small theater chain.    Ms. Stravelli: When you say shows, do you mean movies or live shows?    Mr. Dorn: Movies. He picked up the reels.    Ms. Stravelli: More than just the newsreel, he did the movie itself too, didn't he?    Mr. Dorn: Well, he didn't do the show - he'd pick up the seven shows for the seven theaters, and they'd rotate them around so that each theater got a chance to run that show. I used to go with him on a Saturday and I would run his second show - there were two shows a night in the theater, and I would run the second show. I was so little that I had to stand on a box to thread up the projector.    Ms. Stravelli: Oh, my gosh, how old were you?    Mr. Dorn: At that time I was about fourteen. He'd go out on the little balcony there and take a nap during the show.    Ms. Stravelli: Do you remember any of the movies?    Mr. Dorn: Oh, yes. There were movies with Mabel Norman and Janet Gaynor, and Buddy Rogers, and the film Seventh Heaven. I ran the first color movie: The Black Pirate with Douglas Fairbanks. I used to run his second show for him. When I was fourteen, the owners had two theaters  and one was a summer theater. And they switched the reels back and forth so that the two theatres could run the same show the same night. The theater in Belmar would run three reels and then they'd run them down to the beach. They'd start the three reels, the switcher would pick up two more, take them back, then take three back to the main theatre, and they'd run them back and forth. Once, two weeks before the season ended, the projectionist in the summer theater didn't show up. He didn't tell us he wasn't coming, he just didn't show up, so the manager of Dad's theater ran up to him and said, "What am I going to do, Dan, what can I do?" And my Dad pointed to me and said, "He can run it." So I ran that for two weeks. The next year I got a job running the main theater in Belmar. I was fifteen then. The next summer I got a job switching reels in Spring Lake, at the Colonial Theater. A theater in Spring Lake ran the same show, and I'd ride back and forth on my bicycle with the reels. The year after that I got a job running the projector in the Colonial Theater in Spring Lake. So I never had to look for a job. And then Dad decided to make movies instead of showing movies. He was a field cameraman with Fox news reel at the time, but he got the idea of making these romance pictures with advertising and a little romance story woven through it.  In the meantime, I got a job one summer at an open-air theater in Sea Bright. That was when I was eighteen. I used to go back and forth on my motorcycle, and that's when I got my license. And that was run by a man named Hoge, who was an electrical contractor, and he owned this open air theater. Naturally you couldn't show the pictures until after it got dark. I got a job that summer running that projector. Then the following year Pop got into this advertising movie business, the romance and whatnot. I'm talking about myself, but I thought we were talking about old Red Bank.    Ms. Stravelli: Well, you're part of old Red Bank, right? You and your dad, right? What high school did you go to? You were living in Red Bank, and where did you go to high school?    Mr. Dorn: There was just the old high school that they tore down, Red Bank High School. Before they tore that down, they added the other one on Harding Road, and then later on they got into the Regional because of the increasing population. So now Harding Road is the Middle School - that's where I graduated from in 1928.      Dan Dorn, Sr. shooting romance series movies during the 1930s  Ms. Stravelli: You said your Dad went into making the romance movies, and you made them in Red Bank and Freehold, right?    Mr. Dorn: We made Freehold, Red Bank  we made about thirty of them. We went to Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania, Greenwich, Connecticut, three towns in Long Island, and Stapleton, Staten Island.    Ms. Stravelli: What was happening in the Red Bank that you filmed? It was a little story about a young couple getting married, if I remember correctly. And so it was to give the businesses publicity, was that it?    Mr. Dorn:  The way it was tied in with business, was when they were thinking about getting married, they wanted to go buy furniture and rings and gasoline and cars and whatever the advertiser was selling.    Ms. Stravelli: So where did the movie-makers go in Red Bank for financing?    Mr. Dorn: We would go to a furniture store in Red Bank and get the owner to pay for the advertising. And then they'd go to a jeweler, buy a ring, and go to buy an automobile, whatever they needed. In Red Bank the hero of the story got a job in Wyckoff Feed and Oil, and that tied him in. It showed the boy checking the tanks, and taking the orders, and it showed Wyckoff's facilities. The advertisers paid for the whole thing.    Ms. Stravelli: Where else did they go in Red Bank? What were the stores there at the time?    Mr. Dorn: English had the Ford Agency, Wyckoff had the oil and the feed and grain, Wilber was the jeweler -    Ms. Stravelli: Wilbur Jeweler?    Mr. Dorn: Yes. Clayton McGee was the clothier  I can't remember all of them.    Ms. Stravelli: So it tied the local businesses into the story?    Mr. Dorn: They're all tied into the story.    Ms. Stravelli: And that was shown in the movie theater?    Mr. Dorn: Oh, yes. For a whole week.    Ms. Stravelli: If I remember correctly, you took films of a lot of people in town, too.    Mr. Dorn: People coming out of church, high school classes, we'd take everything in Red Bank  I remember we took a fire drill. We set the camera up and got every kid coming out the door. We had set up a fake fire, that's how the boy met the girl in one film. We had a smudge pot in the house with smoke coming out the window, and we got the fire trucks coming to the fire - the boy would rescue the girl and it was love at first sight.    Ms. Stravelli: So the fire company was in on it too!    Mr. Dorn: Yes. We set up a ladder, and the hero runs up the ladder and takes the girl out of the window and carts her down the ladder and kisses her when he got her to the bottom. That's how he met her. Then they courted. It was the little story mixed into the film.    Ms. Stravelli: Were they locals, the young couple?    Mr. Dorn: Yes.    Ms. Stravelli: Oh, from Red Bank.    Mr. Dorn: They had a contest in the school to get the most popular couple in the high school.    Ms. Stravelli: Oh, my goodness. Do you remember who they were?    Mr. Dorn: Jimmy Stokes was the boy, his father was a dentist, and Florence McDonald was the girl. She lived right on Wallace Street. A pretty girl.    Ms. Stravelli: So you did those for a while with Dad? You said you made about thirty of those with your Dad.    Mr. Dorn: Yes, in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York State, Long Island, Connecticut. We were in that about eight years. We made most of them in New Jersey, but Straussburg was in Pennsylvania, just over the river. Greenwich, Connecticut, of course, was the other border. We just kind of did a circle.    Ms. Stravelli: I think I remember a funny story. I saw Romance in Red Bank  I think somebody told me, Dan Jr. told me, last year, that they found the copy of Romance in Freehold in the trunk of an old car! Is that what happened?    Mr. Dorn: Yes. We have a tape of that, too. When they showed it in the American Hotel in Freehold, the boy and the girl who played in it came to the show, the hero and the heroine. That was quite a nice night when they showed it so many years later. After we filmed a movie, we left it there. We usually had a sponsor, like the Chamber of Commerce, or the Rotary Club. They would more or less check on us to make sure we were legitimate, and they were sort of sponsors. After we'd finish, we'd give them the movie because we had no use for it, and Lord knows what has happened to them all.    Ms. Stravelli: Were they shown in the theater? Were they always shown in a local movie theater?    Mr. Dorn: Oh, yes, every one was shown in a local theater.    Ms. Stravelli: So who paid you and your dad?    Mr. Dorn: The advertiser. There wasn't a whole lot of money in it, I'll tell you.    Ms. Stravelli: Was that during the Depression, or after?    Mr. Dorn: Did you go through the Depression?    Ms. Stravelli: I was born in 1944. I was lucky to miss it by a few years.    Mr. Dorn: You see, as business went downhill, and got worse and worse, there was less money around. The multitudes are what keeps things going. When people don't have any money, the businesses suffer. So advertising in a town where a lot of people were out of work doesn't do it. Because if they don't have the money or are out of work, they can't spend it. We had to quit making those movies because advertising was out. They tried to pump it up with advertising when it first started going down, but we just went into the Depression, and then, of course, no advertising would help. Then we got a job making a newsreel for Bamburger's. And then the same thing happened. We did it for six months and we covered all of New Jersey, once a week, a newsreel about anything that happened in New Jersey. You see Fox News covered the whole Eastern seaboard, but this was just New Jersey.    Ms. Stravelli: Now was this during or after the Depression, or right around there?    Mr. Dorn: No this was just as it was still going downhill. So the same thing happened there. The newsreels were shown in the Warner theaters - and there were seven theaters - so we'd put the newsreel together, and we'd get seven prints, and they'd all show it because a newsreel has to be shown the same week that it happened.    Ms. Stravelli: I remember going to movies and watching the newsreels.    Mr. Dorn: Yes, well we made a newsreel just for New Jersey, it was called Bamberger News.    Ms. Stravelli: Now what events did you look for?    Mr. Dorn: Whatever. Auto races, social events, flower shows, accidents, just like a big newsreel, only just New Jersey. They would have a model airplane show with the motor-driven airplanes that they can control from the ground  they'd have a big gathering. Wherever there was a big bunch of people, you know, we'd take that. I can't remember all of them.    Ms. Stravelli: So you were again traveling constantly.    Mr. Dorn: I was the cameraman. We had two crews. I had one crew and my Dad had another crew. Because to cover the whole state, you had to have two crews. And we did that for six months, and then they cancelled because of the same reason. Advertising wasn't generating sales because there was just no money around. So we got out of that. What we made on that kept us going for another six months. Then we made an Italian movie, an Italian feature picture, called Mamma Abandonata  that's the "Abandoned Mother."    Ms. Stravelli: Here or in Italy?    Mr. Dorn: We did it in New York City. I had to edit it, and I don't speak any Italian. But the owner of the lab where I put it together was an Italian named Guffanti. He checked me. I'd show it to him and say, "Have I got it right?"-- cutting in the close ups, and the like. They came down to our studio -now, see, when we got into the movie business, Pop built a laboratory and a little studio right on Pinckney Road where we lived. So we could do the whole thing right there. So we did that -    Ms. Stravelli: So where was the Italian film shown? If it was in Italian, was it shown in the city?    Mr. Dorn: Well, the people we did it for couldn't pay their lab bill, so the laboratory kept the film. I don't know what they did with it. But it was made for the local theaters in the Italian section of New York City.    Ms. Stravelli: That's where my family lived in New York.    Mr. Dorn: Well, I don't know whether the lab released it and got it shown, I never found out what happened to it. But, when they reviewed the whole thing, the owner of the lab said it was alright, and I didn't speak any Italian! That was a trick! It took me two months to put it together.    Ms. Stravelli: I'll say. I'm surprised you didn't learn Italian while you were doing it.    Mr. Dorn: I learned a few bad words. Anyway, to get back to Red Bank -    Ms. Stravelli: So was that the end of the movie studio?    Mr. Dorn: Yes. Then we got into the photo shop.    Ms. Stravelli: That was in 1937 or so, right?    Mr. Dorn: It was 1936 or 1937 yes. Because I finally told Dad. I said, "This is no life for me. I can't make friends." You're only in a town six weeks and then you move to another town. You come home and put the movie together and go into another town. I lost my friends in Red Bank because I was always out of town, and I couldn't make friends in six weeks, how can you? So I told Dad one time, "Dad, I'd like to settle down at some point." I was about twenty-five. You wouldn't believe how small the shop was, the little photo shop we got into.    Ms. Stravelli: Now it was across the street at first, wasn't it? At 10 Wallace?    Mr. Dorn: It was where the Italian Gaetano's restaurant is now. And then we moved into the lawyer's building, next door, the big brick building, and then we moved across the street.    Ms. Stravelli: So you started a photo shop with a tiny little photo shop. Was it commercial, or what?    Mr. Dorn: Everything. We found a way to do everything photographic. My Dad was very clever -    Ms. Stravelli: He was an inventor, too, was he not?    Mr. Dorn: Yes, he was. He built a lot of the equipment we used. He would improvise. He took a big portrait camera and made a Photostat camera out of it, because somebody came in one day and wanted a copy of a document, so he found a way to do it. Everything he did wound up with a department  like a reproduction department or a portrait department or news and commercial department.    Ms. Stravelli: So that's how the business grew.    Mr. Dorn: Yes.  We did portraits, we did passport photos, we did news work, aerial photography, any job that came in Pop would find a way to do it.    Ms. Stravelli: So you were doing not just wedding photos, you were doing everything.    Mr. Dorn: Everything photographic. It grew because the timing was perfect.    Ms. Stravelli: That was after the Depression?      Daniel Dorn, Sr., jumping. This was the first shot taken to test the new electric flash.  Mr. Dorn: It was during the Depression. In the wintertime I made twelve dollars a week. And I was the owner. To take home. Of course, you took it all home, you paid no taxes - only property tax. In the summer people were taking more pictures, because you've got to understand, that there was no such thing as a flash camera when we started. Most of the pictures were taken with either a floodlight or outdoors. So I'd say a couple of years after we started business, they invented the flash camera. That helped things grow. Because you could take pictures anytime.    Ms. Stravelli: Flash was a newer development?    Mr. Dorn: Flash was a newer thing, yes.    Ms. Stravelli: So your shop grew.    Mr. Dorn: It grew. And like I said, the photographers who were here were growing old and they dropped out, see, so it was an ideal time for a new place to open up. So we just grew like topsy.    Ms. Stravelli: Were you happy to be at home and in one place, then?    Mr. Dorn: Oh, yes. I got married, and luckily got a wonderful girl.    Ms. Stravelli: Did you meet you wife at the shop?     Mr. Dorn: She worked for me.    Ms. Stravelli: What was her name?    Mr. Dorn: Hilda West. I used to be her boss and then we got married. And she got to be a boss!! I'll tell you a funny little story. When we got married, I never gave her a last week's salary. She was making fourteen dollars a week. She was paying board, paying bus fare, paying her lunch and laying away dresses - all on fourteen dollars a week. But I never gave her the last week's salary, right? A couple of years ago we figured out how much I owed her with the interest, and it was something like thirty thousand dollars!    Ms. Stravelli: You should have paid her that fourteen dollars!    Mr. Dorn: Yes. I'm talking about fifty year's interest, compounded interest. But we laugh at that now. She says, "You never paid me my last week's salary!"    Ms. Stravelli: Now, Dan Jr.  told me last year that you kept the plates from the photographers who were going out of business. You kept the glass plates.    Mr. Dorn: Yes. There was a photographer named Andy Coleman who worked with the railroad taking action pictures and pictures of material that needed attention, like, you know, the tracks, he took pictures of what had to be done. And he also took pictures of everything in Red Bank. We inherited those plates  about two tons of them. These were glass plates.    Ms. Stravelli: Right. With the chemical on them?    Mr. Dorn: Yes. The glass plate was covered with the emulsion. We kept them all - a lot of them were scenes of Red Bank, so we sold quite a few prints of those. You ought to take a look in the lab if you want to see some of old Red Bank.    Ms. Stravelli: I think you played a big part of preserving the history of Red Bank by taking those plates and taking care of them.    Mr. Dorn: A lot of people will have some of the prints made from those plates. If they pass on and the pictures are just put away with nothing done with them, then they're gone. But the negative doesn't fade so you look through them and you can find pictures of almost everything in Red Bank. In fact, there were some aerial pictures. We're talking about when aerial photos were rare  it was the late 1800s and the early 1900s, way back.    Ms. Stravelli: Oh, my goodness. I didn't know that there were aerial photos from back then.    Mr. Dorn: Yes. We've got some real oldies.    Ms. Stravelli: Any surprises in there?    Mr. Dorn: One aerial is a shot of North Red Bank here where Riverview Hospital is  it shows that whole area. Irwin's Boat Works and the bulkhead were just being built when Dad went into business, and Riverview Hospital was just an old house. It started in a middle-sized residence. That's where Danny Jr. was born. It was just an old house. The entrance was just two or three steps in a back door - that was the entrance to the hospital. Sure, Danny was born there. That would be in 1939. And the aerial picture shows the whole area before anything was done with it. The steam boat dock, and the Old Union House, an old ice house and so forth.    Ms. Stravelli: There was a steamboat dock? There was a steamboat that docked in Red Bank?    Mr. Dorn: Yes. When I was a teenager, we used to dive off of the paddle wheel, the big enclosure for the paddle wheel. They were called side-wheelers. We used to dive off of them into the river. And they were still running to and from New York.    Ms. Stravelli: From here to New York? Like a ferry?    Mr. Dorn: Yes. Red Bank grew because they had access to New York City before there was any railroad. There was no railroad then. The only way to get anything out of New York was by boat. And for years the area grew because this area needed things from the city and the city was taking the produce from the farmers. The farmers used to come to Red Bank and send their products to New York by steamboat. And we would get coal, and implements, and things that were made in the city. They'd come back here with it. So that's why this area grew and became a center for Monmouth County.    Ms. Stravelli: I didn't realize that steamboats came from New York here to Red Bank.    Mr. Dorn: Oh, yes, sure. Marine Park is where they docked. We've got a lot of old pictures of the Albertina and the Seabird, two of the old side wheelers.    Ms. Stravelli: Did they carry passengers, too?    Mr. Dorn: Oh, yes.    Ms. Stravelli: So you could go to work in the city and visit the city, too.    Mr. Dorn: Oh, sure.    Ms. Stravelli: So Red Bank must have been a very bustling place, a lot of commerce.    Mr. Dorn: It was the hub, you might say, of the whole county. And the steamboat would stop at Rumson and Atlantic Highlands. And, of course, the vacationers would come down to Atlantic Highlands and swim in the ocean.    Ms. Stravelli: What was the fare, I wonder, back then?    Mr. Dorn: Oh, it wasn't much. People used to have excursions, you know. A whole group would go to the city for the day and then they'd come back. I have one picture of a horse and buggy that they took to the city on the steamboat deck. And then there was one group there that had a harp. It was a music group, I guess, and they went up with the harp on the deck of the boat.    Ms. Stravelli: The captain and crew were locals too?    Mr. Dorn: Yes. They had paddle wheelers that went to Oceanport, too, in the South Shrewsbury. The side-wheelers couldn't go down there because it was too shallow. So these had a stern wheel. There were a lot of famous places in that area where the vacationers would come down from the city. You know, I remember we used to have winters that had five and six weeks when you could skate and have ice boat races on the rivers.    Ms. Stravelli: I remember even when I was young we were able to skate everyday.    Mr. Dorn: And the iceboats would have great big races there. They were famous all over. People would come to compete from as far away as Wisconsin.    Ms. Stravelli: To Red Bank?    Mr. Dorn: Yes, with their iceboats. But good skating and ice boating used to last sometimes six or seven weeks. No more since global warming.    Ms. Stravelli: I know. My children don't even know. They look at me like, "What are you talking about?" We used to wait for them to put the marker up so we would know where it would be safe. After school every day we would go and put on our skates, go to the pond and skate around. Somebody would make a little bonfire.    Mr. Dorn: Yes, they had automobiles on the ice, too. They had an airplane that used to take passengers up from the ice. He'd put skis on the wheels. They had a bad accident, so they stopped that. We had a long winter of fun back then. And of course they didn't plow the roads, so there'd be snow on the roads for weeks.    Ms. Stravelli: Blizzards, we would have actual blizzards. When the snow was higher than I was.    Mr. Dorn: We've got pictures of the big blizzard, too. I can't remember what year it was. I think it was 1888.    Ms. Stravelli: Now were people moving into Red Bank and the rest of the county in those days? Was it growing like it is now?    Mr. Dorn: Yes. Professionals - doctors, lawyers, surveyors, and architects, this became like a hub. The whole county was here shopping. Their customers were in the whole county because they didn't have these type of people in all those little towns. They'd come to Red Bank to get these services.    Ms. Stravelli: The surrounding area was still farms, like in Lincroft…    Mr. Dorn: Oh, yes. And then, of course, the surrounding areas all grew because the population grew, and is still growing. It's getting bigger and bigger.    Ms. Stravelli: Some people think so. Now the Shop eventually got big enough to move across the street?    Mr. Dorn: Yes, well, after World War II - see I've seen World War I, World War II, Vietnam, Korea, Desert Storm - I've seen all of those. In World War I, I was eight years old and, like I said, Pinckney Road was a dirt road. Our house was right on the line between Red Bank and Little Silver - the line cut right across our driveway. From our house all the way to Branch Avenue was a big pear orchard that had been abandoned, but the trees were still producing, even though they stopped picking them for the market. There were only eight houses on the whole road - and the road's a quarter of a mile long. Across the street from us, nothing. No houses on the other side of the street at all. During World War I, there was an arsenal at Morgan, New Jersey, that was sabotaged - everything blew up. I remember we had to get out of our houses and go across the street and live in the open until it was over. They didn't know where the exploding shells were going to go.    Ms. Stravelli: So Morgan wasn't that far off?    Mr. Dorn: No, I'd say eight or ten miles. We had to get out of our houses because they didn't know where the shells were going to land or anything. It was scary at the time, I remember that.    Ms. Stravelli: What year was it?    Mr. Dorn: Fall. 1918 or 1917, or something like that.    Ms. Stravelli: So that was life during World War I in Red Bank.    Mr. Dorn: Yes. And Fort Monmouth was then called Camp Vail, and they were experimenting with radio communication between the planes and the ground. The soldiers would come in trucks and set up their equipment right alongside our house, on Pinckney Road in an abandoned cornfield. This was in the fall when the corn had been harvested. They set up their equipment and experimented with communication. I remember I used to go down to the pear orchard and fill up a bushel basket and bring it back for them to eat. And they loved it. I remember the last time I ever saw them, I had a whole bushel basket of pears waiting for them, and they were coming down in their trucks, but they kept on going because they were embarking. They had finished their training and they were going overseas. And they kept right on going. I expected them to stop and set up their equipment. One of the trucks stopped and I threw the pears in the truck. That was the last I saw of them. That was my World War I experience.    Ms. Stravelli: What was it like here during World War II? You already had your photo shop, right?    Mr. Dorn: We had the photo shop and we were doing some work connected with Bendix, which made airplane parts. We made identification photos for the factories. You had to have a picture identification card if you worked in a defense plant. We bought a machine that would take the pictures and print their name and everything on it. Everybody that went on Fort Hancock to work had to have one, and that was part of our service. And we did anything connected to the War. Especially with Bendix, they were making airplane parts, and we did work for them.    Ms. Stravelli: How did it go here? I know that a lot of materials were diverted for the War effort - were there shortages?    Mr. Dorn: There were shortages, things were rationed. It was a tightening of your belt during World War II.    Ms. Stravelli: Did you have blackouts?    Mr. Dorn: Oh, yes. And toward the end I got drafted. I tried to enlist, but I had children and they sent me home. Then toward the end they were taking everybody.    Ms. Stravelli: My dad was drafted into the Navy.    Mr. Dorn: I was in the Navy. I got in as a photographer. I was at an experimental station where all phases of fighter planes, bombs, ammunitions, radio contact  all these departments were experimenting there and I was doing the same thing as I was before I was drafted.    Ms. Stravelli: Was that in New Jersey?    Mr. Dorn: No, that was in Patuxent River, Maryland on Chesapeake Bay. When I was stationed there they froze all of the photographers stationed there  they couldn't be moved. They gave them one rate and they were frozen in rate. So actually you were just a captive photographer and they wanted cheap help. And believe it or not, I was doing the same thing in there that I was doing here for Bendix - taking pictures of broken parts of the airplanes and everything. Another odd thing happened. There was a construction company in Red Bank that had started out by paving some of the original concrete roads in the town - this was Tuller Construction. So I walk out of where I was working one day, and here comes this truck with Tuller Construction Company on the side of it. They were building a simulated arresting gear for testing the airplanes that were going to land on a carrier. They built it on the ground, and it had to be circular so they could turn it into the wind - a carrier always turns into the wind. This had to be on a big turntable so they could turn it any way they wanted to according to the wind. And they were building that. One day I had liberty while my wife wasn't down there. (Later on they came down and stayed with me. I was only there about two years.) Anyway, I was out in front of the place waiting for the bus that served the base, and up the road comes a Tuller Construction Company truck, and I'm hitchhiking like that, and he stopped and picked me up. Tuller Construction Company, Red Bank, New Jersey. And he only took me as far as the gate. When I came back the next day they said, "Did he take you all the way to Red Bank?" I said, "Yes, he took me all the way home." Actually he only took me to the gate. That was an adventure.    Ms. Stravelli: So Dad and Mother kept the shop going here?    Mr. Dorn: Yes.    Ms. Stravelli: You had the four children already?    Mr. Dorn: No, the one we lost at Vietnam was born on the base, and the last one, our daughter Kathy, was born after the war.    Ms. Stravelli: I didn't know you lost a son.    Mr. Dorn: Yes, I've got a picture of him out in the living area. He was just twenty-one when he was killed.    Ms. Stravelli: What was his name?    Mr. Dorn: Phillip. We called him Tinker. They've got a branch of the Marine Corps League named after him. Phillip K. Dorn Detachment, US Marines.    Ms. Stravelli: Dan Jr. was in the Marines, too, right?    Mr. Dorn: Yes.    Ms. Stravelli: Was your son drafted in for Vietnam or did he enlist?    Mr. Dorn: He joined up. Danny Jr. was a Marine, too. But Danny was in and out before the War. Tinker got in at the wrong time.    Ms. Stravelli: Was he a pilot, infantry -    Mr. Dorn: He was infantry: Search and Destroy. They'd go on patrol out into the, well, it was in front of the front, they'd go into there and scout. That was a very bad war  they had these places that were prepared with tunnels. They had tunnels all over the place, like a spider web. They'd go through the tunnels and get behind our lines, and a sniper killed Tinker.    Ms. Stravelli: My friend's husband died over there, too. What was happening here during the Vietnam War, was it like the rest of the country? A lot of disagreement?    Mr. Dorn: No. No demonstrations that I can remember. People had their opinion of the war and how we got into it. It was a politician's war, and it was a sad thing that really cost us. Nixon bought our way out of it - it cost us a lot of money. What good does it do? They're still fighting. We don't seem to learn by these wars, we don't seem to learn anything.    Ms. Stravelli: No. We seem to be getting involved again. Like in South America.    Mr. Dorn: It tells us right in the Bible, wars and rumors of wars, always.    Ms. Stravelli: When did the trains come to Red Bank?    Mr. Dorn: The first railroad was the Old Southern, and that came from the Highlands area down into Red Bank. And then the other main line right out of New York City was built. So at one point, there were two railroad bridges. The Old Southern went out of business so that was abandoned, but the tracks are still there. Red Bank is, to a great extent, a commuter town, a lot of people commute to jobs in Newark and New York. I was here when they electrified it about eight years ago. Now they use electric trains as far as Long Branch  then the diesels take them on down to the end of the line at Bay Head. But there are a lot of commuters on that line.    Ms. Stravelli: What do you think is the biggest change in the area that you've seen?    Mr. Dorn: I think it's the many changes in the business section.    Ms. Stravelli: How did your life change, how did the business change during this time? What's the biggest change that you've seen?    Mr. Dorn: Equipment. New equipment for copying, making copies, and the electronic flash made a big change because it flashes over and over by recharging, and flashes again and again. There used to be a thing that weighed six or seven pounds that you'd fasten to the camera. Now it's a little bitty thing built right into the camera. Now they've got digital cameras to take pictures  there are no negatives, no developing involved, and it goes onto a little chip and they take the picture and you can see right away what the picture is. You've got a little viewing thing and you take the little chip and put it into the machine and it makes the picture. Copy machines too, can do some things that are almost unbelievable. All your color copy enlargers can make an enlargement as big as four by six feet.    Ms. Stravelli: I've seen some of those photos made on a digital camera. They look real, they're so sharp. But somebody told me that the trouble with them is you can alter the picture.    Mr. Dorn: It's like on television  you don't know whether this explosion is real or miniature. It's the same with the digital camera  you don't know if this is what the camera saw or something has been altered. Take one head and put it on somebody else's body…    Ms. Stravelli: Do you think there was more skill to it when you and your Dad did it?    Mr. Dorn: Oh, yes there was. It was all basic, simple and basic. In fact, my dad, as I said, was an inventor. Have you seen pictures of the guy holding the flash up? He had the magnesium powder that goes off, and smoke goes up. Dad improvised a graflex camera that was synchronized with a magnesium flare, not a flashbulb. That was the forerunner of flash pictures. But he never did anything with it. What are you going to do with all this?     Ms. Stravelli: We just went from magnesium flash to the digital camera. And you've seen all that has happened, so the next generation won't forget - or they will at least know what life was like and what happened in the last Century. Your interview is a valuable record. What do you want to make sure we have in it? What should we make sure is in there?    Mr. Dorn: The photography business is a service business, plus selling merchandise, and we'd try to keep up with the times. When something new came out, we'd try to get it and utilize it in our business. Of course, photography became easier as the equipment got smaller. Because when electronic flashes first came out, there was a wet cell unit that weighed fourteen pounds and you carried it on your back. It was attached to the camera. When we went on weddings, we'd have to carry two of them, so that when we took the groups, we'd have one on each side. So that's twenty-eight pounds just for the flash. Now they've made them so small you can put it in your vest pocket. And then they brought out color film  we went through that stage when it went from all black and white to color. When that first came along, we didn't process it, it was sent to Kodak for processing. When it was black and white we used to do it ourselves in our own lab - overnight service. And then, of course, the quality of the film and the quality of the finished product all improved. We used to have to enlarge it onto the paper from the negative and develop it, then put it in another bath, put it in the fixer, wash it for twenty minutes, and put it on the dryer. That's all gone now. You enlarge it on the paper and wash it and it's done. It dries almost immediately. So it eliminates all those other processes. So we try to keep up with all that. The business now has a digital camera, and they take the passports with it. They can see immediately what the photo looks like, and if it's not good, they take it over again right away instead of developing it. And they take that little chip and put it into the machine that makes the picture. You have to get things like that now because some of these people want everything right now. And on top of that, we take quite a few aerial pictures for real estate -      Dan Dorn Sr. (right) and son, Dan Dorn, Jr. circa 1970  Ms. Stravelli: Dan Jr. was telling me that. He goes out to Marlboro Airport a lot.    Mr. Dorn: Yes, we used to rent a plane until somebody had an accident with it and destroyed the airplane, and we had nothing to take a picture with, so we bought an airplane from the owner of the Red Bank Airport in 1966.    Ms. Stravelli: There was an airport in Red Bank?    Mr. Dorn: Yes, there was a Red Bank airport, sure.    Ms. Stravelli: I didn't know that. I know there's one now in Marlboro, but I didn't know there's one here.    Mr. Dorn: It's no longer there, it closed several years ago. Marlboro is the closest one now. We keep the plane there. We've still got it, we still use it.    Ms. Stravelli: Where was the Red Bank Airport?    Mr. Dorn: It was right on Shrewsbury Avenue, where McDonald's is now, right across from the telephone company there. And there was an Airport Inn that stayed in business after the airport closed. It was an eating-place, and it was a popular while the airport was there, you know. And we went through all that with them, their air taxi service, and we'd take pictures for them. I've got a picture - our plane was the last plane to leave Red Bank Airport. They were painting on the airport "Airstrip Closed" so that nobody would land there and I rolled over it and got the wet paint on my wheels. That was the last plane to leave Red Bank Airport.    Ms. Stravelli: You piloted the plane?    Mr. Dorn: Yes, I was a pilot - I took pictures of it. It said "Airstrip Closed" or something like that. I wanted to be the last one out. It was lonely, there wasn't another plane in the airport.    Ms. Stravelli: Why did they close it?    Mr. Dorn: Well, the owner had a bad accident. He killed himself and a couple of other people, and they had also had an accident before that where a plane landed close to the school. It went right off the end. I think there were eight people killed. Everybody in it was killed. It landed just fifty or a hundred yards from the school. There were suits, you know, insurance and everything, and it just kind of went bankrupt.    Ms. Stravelli: The area got too built up, I guess.    Mr. Dorn: Yes. It just outlasted the area. The area got too dense, and those couple of unfortunate accidents closed it up. And also, people were complaining about the noise and things. They moved there when the airport was there, and then they complained because they were near an airport. They had a lot of problems and finally closed up.    Ms. Stravelli: Now your children have kept the business going. You stepped back from the photography business a while ago. When was that?    Mr. Dorn: I retired in 1972 to get out from in front of Danny. Danny had come in with me and we worked together, but I wanted to get out of his way because he had a lot of good ideas, but I was always in front of him, you know. And my dad did the same thing. I didn't walk on my feet alone until I came back from the war in 1944. I guess I was thirty-six years old before I knew if I could stand on my own feet. So I made up my mind to get out of Danny's way as soon as I could. So at sixty-two I got out. And he never asked for any help. He wanted to do it himself. He talked a few things over with me, but he never asked for any help.    Ms. Stravelli: But he worked with you when he was younger?    Mr. Dorn: Oh, yes, we were together for a few years.    Ms. Stravelli: Did you start him off like you?     Mr. Dorn: No, I let him go his own way. He was in the Marines for a while. When he got out of high school I said, "Kid, you've got to go into college or go into the service." And he picked the service. None of us were very good students. I was the poorest student.    Ms. Stravelli: Well, I think you're a pretty good student at photography!    Mr. Dorn: I learned by doing it. That's the only way we ever did things. He did the same way.    Ms. Stravelli: Such an exciting life you had with your Dad. You were everywhere when something was happening.    Mr. Dorn: Oh, gosh, yes, and how!    Ms. Stravelli: I can only imagine, I mean, you must have seen tragedy and happiness, and natural disasters, and man-made disasters. What was the thing that stood out in your young mind most? What was the event that you saw that most impressed you?    Mr. Dorn: I wasn't involved with the Hindenberg exploding and burning, but I was around when it happened. As a matter of fact, we were at Lake Hopatcong doing Romance of Dover when that happened. And then the Morro Castle coming ashore, but we missed that because we were out of town.    Ms. Stravelli: What happened in Red Bank during your time as a photographer? Prominent people, or big events -    Mr. Dorn: We were here when the King and Queen of England came through. I've got a picture of that. We were all at the station  they had all the photographers fenced in so that they couldn't run out on the station. They put them out there where we could get pictures, you know.    Ms. Stravelli: Wow. Why did they come through Red Bank?    Mr. Dorn: They were going out on a destroyer. They wanted to get on a destroyer at Atlantic Highlands for some of a sightseeing trip put on by the President. They came by train to Red Bank, and then by limousine to Atlantic Highlands where they boarded the ship.    Ms. Stravelli: Did the President ever come through? Any of the Presidents?    Mr. Dorn: I think so, but I don't think I was around. This was way back. The old Theodore Roosevelt at times. And President Garfield, of course, was assassinated in Long Branch, but I wasn't here then, either.    Ms. Stravelli: So Red Bank's seen a lot of history and experienced a lot of growth.    Mr. Dorn: Well, you know for the eight or nine years I was working out of town, we missed a lot of things that happened. But one of the other things that was sort of a highlight every year was the sweepstakes regatta - the powerboats with Guy Lombardo. Guy Lombardo came every year.    Ms. Stravelli: He had the Royal Canadians, right?    Mr. Dorn: Royal Canadians, right. He also had a beautiful speedboat that he used to race here in the regatta. He won it two or three years. I have pictures of that.    Ms. Stravelli: Did you get to know Count Basie, or photograph Count Basie?    Mr. Dorn: No, his father was custodian of the apartment building across the street. The building had stores on the first floor, and we had our shop there. Count Basie's father was the custodian, and he lived in a little bungalow behind the place. The bungalow's still there. The young man who helped him maintain the place lives in that bungalow now. But, like I say, we were out of town for eight years, just popping in for two weeks, to put the picture together, and then going to another town, and I missed a lot of things. And I lost track of a lot of friends.    Ms. Stravelli: But you came back. You've been here a long time since coming back.    Mr. Dorn: Yes. And then, as I said, my wife came to work for me and we fell in love.    Ms. Stravelli: That's such a sweet story.    Mr. Dorn: She wanted a family and I wanted a family - we just clicked, you know. A wonderful girl. That's why I want to keep her here. As long as I can. I promised. When you get married you make promises.    Ms. Stravelli: That's right, for better or worse, in sickness and in health, that's right.    Mr. Dorn: I guess I must have taken a hundred weddings when I was in that business, but we finally abandoned that because the competition was being too elaborate, and it just got to be too much. And the photographers got so much overtime because it was Saturday and Sunday weddings that the shop wasn't making anything on them so we stopped. But every time I took a wedding, I'd hear the ceremony. I'd say, "Did I promise that?"    Ms. Stravelli: I know, when you listen to those words, it's impressive    Mr. Dorn: It got fixed in my mind so I said, "I promised all that, and now I'm going to do it."    Ms. Stravelli: And God will give you the grace to do it, too.    Mr. Dorn: Yes, you promise before God and the company attending.    Ms. Stravelli: Where did you get married? In Red Bank, in the church in Red Bank?    Mr. Dorn: No, when I went to school there was a young fellow whose father was a minister at the church right on the corner of Red Bank where the Broadway Grill is now. That was just a big old church there. His name was Raver, Roland Raver, that was the boy's name. He became a minister, too. A friend told me about it and said, "It'd be nice if you'd go down and let Roland Raver marry you." So it was in Pemberton, New Jersey. So we went down there and got married.    Ms. Stravelli: So a friend married you, that was special.    Mr. Dorn: We often laugh about how we didn't have much then, but we made do. There were a lot of people in the same boat.    Ms. Stravelli: People started out simple then.    Mr. Dorn: We didn't need much. We always laugh about it because we had just enough money. We were going to the city overnight and then come back the next day - that was going to be the honeymoon. And this friend that got us to be married there wanted us to go to Washington to stay overnight with them. And I didn't want to go, but I'd make believe that I wanted to go, but my wife didn't want to go. She would say, "Well, if you really want to go, it's all right with me." We were in separate cars so I'd get back in the car - we had our reception in the lunch wagon - everybody paid for their own, that was our reception. So we get back in the car and I say, "Honey, I don't really want to go, but I don't want to just tell them no, so I'm blaming it on you, so you say you don't want to go. You don't want to stay at that house." Darn if we wouldn't stop again on the way down to Washington and the same thing would happen. They'd say, "You're going to stay with us, aren't you?" And I'd say, "Well, it'd be alright but she doesn't want to stay there." And she'd pipe up, "Well, if you really want to stay." So we stayed at a hotel in Washington the first night and then we stayed at their house overnight and then we came home. We only had twenty-five dollars with us. Gasoline was ten cents a gallon. We stayed at the hotel the first night, took the couple that we stayed with to dinner, and came back - on twenty-five dollars. And Pop said, "Did you bring any change back?" True story.    Ms. Stravelli: What do you think the future holds for Red Bank? What's going to happen in our area?    Mr. Dorn: Well, it's on a high right now because of the improvements that they've made. If the economy stays they way it is, Red Bank is golden, because there are several brokerage houses in Red Bank, and they employ a lot of people and pay a lot of taxes. If the economy stays up where it is, then they will have no problem. And they're doing a lot of things to promote business for the stores and everything. They're trying to get a lot of them to stay open nights, because these projects they have to bring people to Red Bank, usually bring them at night.    Ms. Stravelli: Well, people are working, so they decide to come after work.    Mr. Dorn: They want the store to take advantage of the influx of people that come here at night. Right now the ones to benefit from it are the eating-houses. The restaurants, and the eating-places, and the theater, and then they have a dance studio, and they have a karate studio. There's a lot of night activity here, but not for the retail stores. So they're trying to get them to stay open at night  we used to stay open two nights a week, way back. Then the hours start to change, and most people close like five-thirty or six - most retail stores. They're having a move now to try to get more stores to stay open at night.    Ms. Stravelli: I guess life is changing. We used to have dinner and read the paper, and now people work late and don't go home to have dinner.    Mr. Dorn: The only thing you can rely on is change. You know it's going to change. Sometimes for the better, sometimes not.    Ms. Stravelli: You saw a lot of change.    Mr. Dorn: Oh, I've seen a lot of changes, yes. I've had a good life, I've had a very good life. I like fun, I like people, and I'm still kind of scatter-brained.    Ms. Stravelli: I think you're an adventurer. I think you've done a lot and seen a lot.    Mr. Dorn: Well, you ask my family, "Is your dad really like Uncle George?" they will bust out laughing.    Ms. Stravelli:  You've had a good long life, you've had a family, and a wonderful marriage, and a business that endures. Your business didn't stay stagnant, it changed.    Mr. Dorn: It just grew like topsy, although I'm not a businessman. I like to serve people. Danny is like me. He's a working boss. He works in the store at the counter, just like any other employee, and he went through the same thing I did. When you get a tough customer, all the clerks would go in the back, and you've got to wait on him.    Ms. Stravelli: He told me last year that your advice to him, when you turned the business over, was, "If you want to keep the business going, you're going to have to make the man that comes in the door smile."    Mr. Dorn: Yes, and if you're busy, on the phone or something, you at least acknowledge that he's there, you know, because he's important. I used to say to my new employees, "Who's the most important person that walks through that door in this shop?" And they'd say, "Well, you are." And I'd say, "No, I'm not. The most important person in the place is the customer. And the second most important person is the one that waits on him. Not me. Whoever takes care of that man who walks in the door is the second most important person in the place." And I'd try to tell him to nod or acknowledge that a person is waiting. They don't get it.    Ms. Stravelli: Nowadays not so much as they used to. Dan told me your employees were like family, that people were really close.    Mr. Dorn: Most of our employees were very good.    Ms. Stravelli: You had somebody working fifty years. Eddie Ostrander, is it?    Mr. Dorn: Yes he worked there longer than I did. I retired and he kept on working.    Ms. Stravelli: Is he a relative?    Mr. Dorn: No.    Ms. Stravelli: Just a long time employee.    Mr. Dorn: Well, he had a tough childhood, so he kind of adopted me, you know, as a father figure. We got along well. These people knew their job, I never bossed them, I didn't have to. We had Earl Stout who worked with us for about forty years. And Pete Gisleson came to work right after Earl did  he just retired four years ago. They came to work after the War. When they came back from the war, a lot of these employers didn't want to take them back because they'd already hired replacements. When the veterans went to get their jobs back, they went back to the same ways that they did when they left to go to the service. Some came to work for me, and they were faithful. I want to tell you, they helped me grow. We worked, the three of us, Earl, Pete, and myself, for nine years without a vacation. They took double money instead of a vacation, because they were building a house, and they had families. And that includes some Sunday work, some night work. Unbelievable people. I couldn't have done it without them, I couldn't have done it alone. But they stuck right with me, and like I say, I didn't have to boss them, I never bossed them.    Ms. Stravelli: So how would you do your life over again?     Mr. Dorn: I'd make the same mistakes, sure. I don't think I could improve on it. I don't have any regrets that I can think of.    Ms. Stravelli: That's wonderful, what a blessing to be able to say that.    Mr. Dorn: My folks on my father's side were all missionaries. One of them was a doctor and a missionary in China. His sister was a missionary in China. And my grandmother, my father's mother, was very much involved in the church, helping people. I think I must have inherited it because I like to help people. I like to make people smile. If I can make somebody happy, I'm happy.    Ms. Stravelli: How wonderful. That's the way it's supposed to be.    Mr. Dorn: I don't have any formal religion. I joined the Methodist church because my friend asked me to. And I taught Sunday school for two years, and I wasn't even a member of the church. I did it for my friend. They were stuck for Sunday school teachers. And I got out because it got too commercialized. They started buying workbooks for the children. And they wanted me to learn how to teach with the workbooks and I said, "Goodbye." I said, "I've taught them the Lord's Prayer, I've taught them the Ten Commandments, I've taught them what He expects of us, and that He's real, and that when you pray, you've got to believe that He's listening. I've taught them some basic things, but these workbooks, they're not involved in it at all. You're giving these kids homework. They are going to school and they get homework. And they've got to bring this back next Sunday as homework for me to correct? Bye Bye."    Ms. Stravelli: What would be the best advice you would give today, to a grandchild, or a young person? What would your advice be about how to live your life?    Mr. Dorn: Well, I would say, "Live it." Just take advantage of your opportunities, utilize your talents. If you have a certain talent and can get gainful employment using that talent, you're going to be a happier person. In other words, if you like what you're doing for a living, you're going to be a happy person. Serve others, try not to hurt anybody as you go through, but live it, live it to the fullest. Try to do the things that make you happy, whether it's doing a bungee jump, or jumping in a parachute, or taking a white water trip. Try to accomplish those things in your lifetime, and live it. I don't know what else.    Ms. Stravelli: That's wonderful. That says it all. That's so wonderful.   
MonmouthCounty;Daniel J. O'Hern;1930;2000;Daniel J. O'Hern, 1930, 2000        Remembering the 20th Century: An Oral History of Monmouth County      Justice Daniel J. O'Hern  Date of Interview: August 4, 2000   Names of Interviewers: James M. McGovern, Jr. and Robert Honecker  Premises of Interview: Red Bank, NJ  Birthdate of subject: May 23, 1930    Mr. McGovern: Good morning, Justice. It's nice to be here in your Chambers overlooking the Navesink River. As both of us have great ties to Red Bank, I would just like to ask you to start with, where were you born? Where did you grow up, and where did you go to Law School? Tell us something about your early career, please.    Justice O'Hern: I was born here in Red Bank, New Jersey. I was actually one of the first born in the Riverview Hospital. I went to Harvard Law School. My first summer job was with the firm of Quinn, Doremus, McCue and Russell on Broad Street in the summer of 1955. Among the partners were Ernie Fasano and Ben Nicosia.    Mr. McGovern: Ernie Fasano I know graduated from Harvard, but this was his father?    Justice O'Hern: Yes. Well, the Ernie Fasano I am speaking of would be in his eighties now. He went to Harvard in the 1930s.    Mr. McGovern: He was partners with Ben Nicosia at one point. Yes, I knew him. He practiced along with the Ansells, when I was a young lawyer.    Justice O'Hern: That's correct. He was one of the best brief writers who ever practiced.    Mr. McGovern: Yes, he was. He was one of the classic inside lawyers who never went to court, but could certainly write some briefs. So excuse me for interrupting you. You worked each summer during law school?    Justice O'Hern: The second summer I went to Dewey Ballantine in New York. I had an experience there that discouraged me from returning. I had a very long assignment…some issue about arbitration. I went to the partner and told him my opinion. I must have written a memo, or something like that. And he told me I had to keep looking, and he sent me back. I thought to myself, I don't want to spend my life going over the same subjects over and over. In any event, I was not terribly attracted to the Wall Street practice.    Mr. McGovern: That summer, did you live in New York or did you commute from Red Bank?    Justice O'Hern: I commuted.    Mr. McGovern: How long did that take?    Justice O'Hern: Well, it took about an hour and ten minutes.    Mr. McGovern: And the trains at those times would go into Jersey City, and then you would take a ferry across?    Justice O'Hern: When I first started in high school, the nicest part of the day was the ferry ride. I always loved that ferry ride.    Mr. McGovern: That was between what is now Liberty State Park and downtown.    Justice O'Hern: Liberty Street, New York.    Mr. McGovern: When you graduated from Harvard, you were privileged to take a clerkship with Justice Brennan in the Supreme Court. Can you tell us about that?    Justice O'Hern: Well, this is a long story. I was standing on a street in Cambridge, Massachusetts when I met one of my teachers who said to me, "You must be very thrilled that your New Jersey Judge was appointed to the Supreme Court." I said, "Well, I'm happy for him. But I'm disappointed. I wanted to clerk for him in New Jersey. I live in the same town that he had set up his chambers in." Justice Brennan was one of five Essex County members of the Supreme Court, maybe six. They decided that someone should be outside of Essex County, and he came down here. He lived in Rumson and had his chambers in Red Bank.    Mr. McGovern: I think his chambers were at 103 East Front Street.    Justice O'Hern: He had just moved in that office the day that Attorney General, I think it was Brownell or Bill Rogers, one of them, called him up. He was unpacking the books then. In any event, I told this story to my teacher. And the teacher asked me if I was still interested. I told him I was interested, but I didn't think I had much of a chance. And then he looked at me and said, "I pick his clerks." That was Professor Paul Freund, and he picked me. And so I got that opportunity.    Mr. McGovern: His chambers, of course, were in Washington. Did he have local chambers?    Justice O'Hern: No. He continued to live in Rumson for perhaps maybe six months, but he very soon resettled in Washington. He had a wonderful home in Georgetown that he rented, that was decorated by The China and Glass Shop of Red Bank. They had gone down to decorate it for him.    Mr. McGovern: Is that the store that is now in Rumson?    Justice O'Hern: Yes.    Mr. McGovern: Was that a two-year clerkship?    Justice O'Hern: One year.    Mr. McGovern: Can you recall any decisions that you worked on that have become famous or infamous?    Justice O'Hern: There are two cases that Justice Brennan wrote that endured a long time. One is Byrd vs. Blue Ridge Power. It has to do with this Erie Tompkin's question of, "What is substance and what is procedure?" In a diversity case, you are supposed to apply the law of the State, and the question was whether Federal procedures were different. That case is still in the law books. Another case he wrote is Speiser vs. Randall. It had to do with Loyalty Oaths, which were the big things in those days. This was the end of the McCarthy era of 1957. The court was very ginger about taking this issue head on. That case said that no one should have to prove loyalty. If you could prove they were disloyal, they could be barred from employment. So it was a Burden of Proof case. It didn't seem like much, but that case has lasted a long time. In retrospect, the issues of 1957 were not cosmic issues. The great changes in the criminal law didn't take place until  a new majority got to the court, I think under Goldberg.    Mr. McGovern: That was after the Eisenhower Administration and into the Kennedy/Johnson Administration. Did you remain very friendly and keep in touch with Justice Brennan through his life?    Justice O'Hern: Justice Brennan was one of the most remarkable people you would ever want to meet. I have many friends who had this experience: they would go up to him somewhere and tell him where they were from and that they knew Dan O'Hern. He would just gush over them. People made such an impression on him. For many years we had an Annual Clerk's Dinner in Washington, during which he would regale us with stories of the court and what was going on. He gave a party on Sunday of that weekend, and I wrote this in an article once…he made the best Bloody Mary that I have ever had!    Mr. McGovern: I wish I had known him then! (laughter)    Justice O'Hern: It just tasted better.    Mr. McGovern: Did he remain tied to New Jersey in his mind, if not physically?    Justice O'Hern: He always read The Star Ledger every day. So he was very conversant with the New Jersey politics and the work of the court and so forth.    Mr. McGovern: When you came back to Red Bank, what firm did you work for?    Justice O'Hern: Well, I didn't come to Red Bank first. In fact, I asked Justice Brennan where to go. Of course he commended his firm, the Pitney Firm, but Clyde Szuch had just gone there the previous year. I interviewed with Lowenstein, Allen Lowenstein. But Allen had just left Riker Danzig and started his own firm. Well, the long and short of it is, I ended up working with fellows named Roy Collins and Ed Toner, and it was called Collins and Toner. It was a small firm. We had about two or three very good clients. But I still had this desire to come to Monmouth County. Vince McCue had separated from his firm, so he was looking for somebody. And I went with them in 1962.    Mr. McGovern: Where was his office?    Justice O'Hern: 60 Broad Street, in Red Bank.    Mr. McGovern: And how many lawyers were with him?    Justice O'Hern: Just the two of us, and one secretary. It was one hundred twenty-five a week for rent and sixty-five dollars a week for the secretary. Vince always told me not to buy any books. He didn't want to have a big overhead. (laughter)    Mr. McGovern: And what kind of law did you practice with him?    Justice O'Hern: Vince at that time represented an insurance company. So it was very fortunate that in my very first year, I was able to try four or five cases. You know, no one gets to try cases any more!    Mr. McGovern: It's a lament that I have training young lawyers now that nobody tries cases.    Justice O'Hern: So it was a wonderful experience for me, and I stayed there for four years. We had some interesting cases. Do you remember George Snuffy Stirnweiss, the baseball player? He was on a Central Railroad of New Jersey train that went off the bridge in Bayville.    Mr. McGovern: I remember that. I grew up right over here in Middletown. My father was on the train after that, and I recall vividly him coming home that night and my mother crying and crying. Because it's not like today, where you can pick up a cell phone and call somebody. And she didn't know what had happened to my father. That wreck made some Red Bank lawyers very famous.    Justice O'Hern: It's the earlier case that you're thinking of, the Woodbridge Train Wreck in 1951.    Mr. McGovern: The Central Jersey one was in the mid 1950s.    Justice O'Hern: Correct. And it was a little later train, so there weren't too many people on it.    Mr. McGovern: The earlier case is the one that made Lou Drazin famous. When you started practicing in Red Bank, who were the other there?    Justice O'Hern: The leading firm was the Parsons firm. They had a very strong plaintiff's practice. The Reussille Firm was a bit of a 'silk stocking' firm. Sam Carotenuto and Milton Mausner were sort of post-World War II guys. And Milton was very shrewd about seeing this opportunity for regionalization of sewer services, and so they got to represent the regional sewer service. That was a big boost to their practice. The Parsons firm was the dominant firm, as I say, had all the municipalities and school boards, it seemed. The Roberts firm across the river had almost all the Bayshore towns at that time.    Mr. McGovern: That was Howard Roberts?    Justice O'Hern: Howard Roberts.    Mr. McGovern: And he was a politician.    Justice O'Hern: Roberts, Pillsbury and Carton. Howard Roberts was, I think, County Clerk. But he was definitely a power...    Mr. McGovern: Was there a lawyer named Barnicle with him, as well?    Justice O'Hern: Barnicle was in that firm, yes. Jimmy Minogue, the Cartons, young Larry, and Bud Saling were in that firm.    Mr. McGovern: Bud Saling was from Highlands, I think.    Justice O'Hern: That is correct.    Mr. McGovern: You were in Democratic politics. Was the Roberts firm in Republican politics?    Justice O'Hern: Larry Carton once tried to persuade John Pillsbury to hire me, and Pillsbury told him I was too Democratic! (laughter) So they were definitely…but I shouldn't describe them as a political firm because they were terrific lawyers and had a great practice. But they were associated with the Republican Party.    Mr. McGovern: Were you involved at all in the development or any real estate or development practice as Middletown developed?    Justice O'Hern: We didn't do any of what you would call the 'tract work' in Middletown. There was a fellow by the name of Lefferts, who was the great builder of the firm.    Mr. McGovern: It was Jake Lefferts.    Justice O'Hern: Yes, Jake Lefferts and Sev Sorrenson. An Atlantic Highlands lawyer was Lefferts' attorney.    Mr. McGovern: One of our mutual great friends, Norman Peer, tells stories of clerking for Sorrenson.    Justice O'Hern: Did he tell you the one about the time he took a year off? Sev said that he was sick of the practice and was taking a year off. And it was a true story. He got on a boat, and he left for a year. But he must have had some money in the bank.    Mr. McGovern: His son is a lawyer now.    Justice O'Hern: Yes.    Mr. McGovern: They call him King Sorenson. In Red Bank, how was the practice of law on a day-to-day basis? Today, as you know, we work a lot of hours, and we eat at our desks, and we don't spend much leisure time.    Justice O'Hern: You know this business of eating at the desk, frankly, it's barbaric. One of the things I loved about the practice of law was we went out to lunch every day. Of course Milton represented every Greek restauranteur in Red Bank, so we had a series of places that we would go. But the point is, we always took at least an hour a day for lunch. And often I would go to the Root Beer & Checkers Club, and that was a wonderful Red Bank luncheon club. Mr. Parsons was there, and Ted Labrecque Sr. was there before he became a Judge. So the pace was entirely different. The pace that I saw that summer of 1954. I would go in the morning, and about 10:30 a.m. we would go out for a cup of coffee. Then about noon, everybody would go for lunch. And sometimes the partners wouldn't come back until 2:00 p.m. About 3:30 p.m. we'd take another stroll down Broad Street. And this was not useless, because very often they would meet clients and pick up business out on the street. But it was an entirely different pace! Court did not begin until 10:00 a.m. You could go into the office and read the morning mail, and this was a wonderful thing! (Laughter) You could get in the car at 9:20 a.m., and there weren't a million lights, so you'd be in Freehold in time for a 10:00 a.m. court date.    Mr. McGovern: How did you get to Freehold?    Justice O'Hern: I knew every back road that's possible. Vince McCue had come from a farm family, and knew lots of back roads. I couldn't even tell you how to do it now. We went through all kinds of back roads to get there.    Mr. McGovern: I would imagine the traffic was not where as it is today?    Justice O'Hern: No. It was literally farmland from here to there, in the 1960s.    Mr. McGovern: When you first started practicing, was court still held in the Hall of Records as well as in the Courthouse?    Justice O'Hern: The only thing in the Hall of Records was the Chancery Court. We always had a Chancellor from Atlantic County, or at least when I started. And I had no idea why that was. It grew out of the fact that I think at one time, lawyers had to go to Atlantic City to appear in the Chancery Court. This was at the turn of the century, 1910s and 1920s. Too bad Judge Ted Labreque is not still with us, but he could tell you those stories. One of the stories I heard was that you were always taken in the order of seniority, the senior lawyer's cases were taken first. So Leon Leonard and Judge Herb Horn were the Chancellors. And they did, of course, the matrimonial work and the general equity work.    Mr. McGovern: Did they handle Chancery from the Raritan River South?    Justice O'Hern: I don't think Middlesex.    Mr. McGovern: How often did they come to Monmouth County?    Justice O'Hern: They were here every day.    Mr. McGovern: They didn't live here, did they?    Justice O'Hern: No.    Mr. McGovern: Because both of those men's firms are synonymous with Atlantic City.    Justice O'Hern: Right.    Mr. McGovern: How many Judges were there in Monmouth County?    Justice O'Hern: I would say there were about six. There was Judge Edward Knight, Judge Giordano, Judge Asher, Judge Evans, and there may be a couple I am missing. But that was the basic….    Mr. McGovern: Was Judge Smith, Tom Smith's father?    Justice O'Hern: He didn't come until maybe the middle 1960s.    Mr. McGovern: How long did you spend with Vince McCue?    Justice O'Hern: Four years.    Mr. McGovern: Was it from Vince McCue that you went and joined Milton Abramoff?    Justice O'Hern: Correct.    Mr. McGovern: How did you come to go with Milton?    Justice O'Hern: Actually Chet Apy came to me. You know Chet was a good businessman. He knew that there was opportunity here, and so he invited me to join with him. It was a wonderful experience. In all the years we practiced together, we never had a single, major disagreement over fees, or clients, or anything.    Mr. McGovern: When you said Chet, that's Chet Apy, who is now a Worker's Compensation Judge?    Justice O'Hern: Right.    Mr. McGovern: And Milt Abramoff, who is one of the finest men I have ever met in my life. I had the pleasure of practicing law with him.    Justice O'Hern: Milton, as you know, is an exceptional lawyer. He was a graduate of Harvard Law School and then worked with a Newark firm. And he practiced with Larry Carton for a period of time, right after World War II.    Mr. McGovern: And wasn't he, at some point, with Lou Drazin?    Justice O'Hern: That's true. That's often forgotten. I don't remember the details of that, but I think that's right.    Mr. McGovern: When did you start with the firm of Abramoff, Apy and….    Justice O'Hern: That was in 1966.    Mr. McGovern: And that is the firm you stayed with until you went into government service.    Justice O'Hern: Yes.    Mr. McGovern: How did you get involved in the politics of Red Bank?    Justice O'Hern: Well, the politics grew out of my mother's association with Jack Quinn. He was the leading Democrat in Monmouth County, and I recently saw a story about his  appointment as Prosecutor of the County. They gave a big party, and it was a social event. People came from all sides. But in any event, my aunt was his legal secretary. She idolized Jack Quinn. So my mother and my aunt were involved in Democratic politics, and it was just sort of natural that I would be expected to be involved, too. Shortly after I came here in 1960, when I joined up with Vince McCue, was the Kennedy election. That was a very galvanizing event for a young Democrat, especially an Irish Catholic. It was a very exciting night. We had a number of very fine people in the Democratic Party in Red Bank, like Katherine Elkus White, who later became Ambassador to Denmark under President Johnson. There was John Petillo and Ben Nicosia. And Ben became the leader of the Party from the 1960s on.    Mr. McGovern: Was Monmouth County as Republican as it is today?    Justice O'Hern: They seemed invincible at the time. In Red Bank, for example, when we started running, no Democrat had won an election since the Great Depression.    Mr. McGovern: Was J. Victor Carton the Prosecutor at that time?    Justice O'Hern: Correct.    Mr. McGovern: And he was essentially the Republican leader in the County, I guess.    Justice O'Hern: The Republican powers in the County were the Stouts, from Neptune. You see Ocean Grove was such a solid, voting block that it was really the base of Republican power.    Mr. McGovern: How did you manage to get elected here in Red Bank, as a Democrat?    Justice O'Hern: The first time I was elected was in 1962. Ben ran in 1960. And he came very close to a man named George Gray. You may have practiced before George?    Mr. McGovern: Absolutely.    Justice O'Hern: I loved George. Not everybody loved him, but he was a wonderful man. But he did not suffer fools. Vince told me that George had learned from a lawyer named Lester Leonard, who was one of these people that thought he was a King. So George was sort of imperious, and he nearly lost the election in 1960. In 1962, we had a little bit of a leg up there with George not being terribly popular. And a feud erupted in the fire department, of which I was the beneficiary.  I defeated a guy who was a fireman, because he forgot that he was Councilman and wanted to be Fire Chief. (Laughter) So that was how we won that first election.    Mr. McGovern: Were you the only Democratic Councilman when you first when on the Council?    Justice O'Hern: Correct.    Mr. McGovern: Like our friend Ed McKenna, one person got in, and then you eventually got more and more in until…    Justice O'Hern: We got a big boost in 1964 from the Johnson election. We got two seats that year.    Mr. McGovern: Was Judge Gray still on the Council then, or had he been appointed to the Bench?    Justice O'Hern: I can't remember. He must have been appointed to the Bench around 1963, shortly after that election. Because a fellow named Dick Gale ran in 1964.    Mr. McGovern: Was Judge McGann a political power in Red Bank at that time?    Justice O'Hern: I wouldn't describe him as a political power in Red Bank as much as in the county. Pat got elected to the Assembly, if I'm not mistaken, in 1965 in the great Richard Hughes sweep. And Hughes, if we recall, made one of the biggest mistakes in history by paying off a political debt. He agreed that the strikers would get paid unemployment benefits. This drove people berserk! And it was a combination of other things that led to the Republican landslide in 1966, and eventually the 1969 election of Cahill. I'm not criticizing Hughes, it's just a matter of history.    Mr. McGovern: Who was the Mayor of Red Bank when you first went on the Council?    Justice O'Hern: Ben Nicosia. Ben was elected in 1962. He and I were elected together in 1962. In 1965, we ran with Hughes. Let's see if I get these years right. It was a two-year term for Mayor. He ran in 1964 in the Johnson election. I ran again in 1965 with Ted Labrecque. And that was the high tide of Dick Hughes' career.    Mr. McGovern: How did the politics affect the practice of law?    Justice O'Hern: Frankly, I never made any money out of politics, so to speak. We were pretty successful in avoiding being characterized as 'political' lawyers. We didn't have a lot of towns. Milton had the Eatontown Planning Board, and Chet had Little Silver, I believe. We didn't think we were identified as a political firm. Chet, for example, was in the Assembly through most of the 1960s and 1970s.    Mr. McGovern: Chet was a Republican and you were a Democrat. Did you ever have any friction over that?    Justice O'Hern: No. That was strange, but we never had the slightest bit of friction over that. I guess it was to some extent because at the office we divorced ourselves from it. You know, you can keep the problems out of the office. I was, at various times, the Mayor of Red Bank. We had an office right on Broad Street, and people would walk right in during the day.      Daniel O'Hern (second from left) with his wife (far left), pictured with Mr. and Mrs. Art Kamin  Mr. McGovern: When did you become Mayor?    Justice O'Hern: 1968. Ben Nicosia became Assistant Prosecutor in 1966, probably the spring of 1966. So I ran against John Arnone in 1966, and I lost to him that year. And that was Cliff Case who ran, and he demolished his opponent. He was a Senate candidate. John had a terrific plurality and won. In 1968, we had a reevaluation, which was one of John's biggest mistakes. They respected the law and agreed to revaluate the properties in Red Bank, and that hurt very much. Then of course, I had the benefit of a presidential election. You get more votes.    Mr. McGovern: More people vote then.    Justice O'Hern: Yes.    Mr. McGovern: To digress a little bit, one of the most interesting things we were talking about in the Bar Association is, who was the oldest lawyer that you remember when you were a young lawyer?    Justice O'Hern: If I'm not mistaken, Jonas Tumen is the name that I remember. He was a lawyer in Asbury Park. Harry Tumen, he practiced all through the 1970s, and I think this was Harry's father, if I'm not mistaken. But there was a whole generation of older lawyers like Ed Fary up in Keyport. Keyport actually had been a great legal center. It was a shipping town off Red Bank. So there were some older lawyers up there. Mr. Roberts, of course, probably was in his seventies in those days. Leon Reussille was probably in his seventies.    Mr. McGovern: And they had practiced in the 1800s, I would assume. Or early 1900s.    Justice O'Hern: Early 1900s, yes. I remember asking Ted Labrecque this. I asked him how he used to get to court. And he said he took the train to Matawan, and then he took the train from Matawan to Freehold. That's how they got to court.    Mr. McGovern: Wow, that must have been an all-day excursion!    Justice O'Hern: Remember, court only sat for certain sessions. Vince McCue told me this. He said the thing to do was to get your case adjourned, and it went to the bottom of the list. You might not see it again for years! So that was the trick.    Mr. McGovern: There were no 'calendar calls' or things of that nature.    Justice O'Hern: Well the 'calendar call' had come in by the time I started, but not at the time they are talking about. But the 'calendar call' was a rather pleasurable thing. I never forget 'calendar calls' in Ocean County. They used to have 'monthly call,' where the cases would be assigned months in advance.    Mr. McGovern: Back in those days and throughout your practice, did you always make enough money to live comfortably?    Justice O'Hern: No, I never made enough to live comfortably. But I'd like to finish that story about 'monthly calls.' I'll never forget my first appearance in Ocean County. Lawyers got up, and they would be projecting calendars quite a way in advance. And the Judge would say, "What about April 10th?" And he'd say, "Well, I think that's duck hunting season."  "Ok," Judge Larrabie would say. Anything connected with duck hunting merited a postponement. (Laughter) Well, money! You see the thing about money is, you didn't need as much money then as you need today. I told you I practiced in Red Bank, and I was quite impressed with the way these people lived. Allaire Cornwall, Shake Cornwall, I don't know why they called him Shake, but his habit or hobby was posting a weather forecast on the first floor of their building. They were on the second floor at 34 Broad Street. He had a lovely place in Fair Haven. Bill Blair, the Parsons lawyer, had a beautiful home on the river. So I thought you could make enough money here to live very comfortably. But inflation started to set in the 1970s, and I watched these homes go from fifty thousand dollars a year to two million for the kind of home that we thought a suburban lawyer should deserve.    Mr. McGovern: That is absolutely true today, that a lawyer makes a comfortable living but it is not…    Justice O'Hern: Lawyers in the 1960s dabbled in real estate. A name that comes to mind is Bill Throckmorton, we'll call him Throcky. He was a very good investor, and he bought a lot of real estate.    Mr. McGovern: He practiced in Long Branch?    Justice O'Hern: Yes. Stokes and Throckmorton.    Mr. McGovern: Who would be a good friend of yours, in the practice of law that you have known for many, many years, that you consider to be someone very close to you?    Justice O'Hern: Aside from my partners, I'm actually closest to Ben Nicosia. Although we were not in the same firm, we were political allies. Milton and I have remained very close friends through the years. And there's Chet Apy. These would be my three principal friends from the practice years. Ted Labrecque and I were very close, but he moved to Holmdel. In those days, when somebody left Red Bank, we couldn't understand it. It seemed like he had gone to the other end of the world! I always tell my clerks this story. Across the river you see a white house, and it's shadowed by the trees. But I was born and raised just around the bend in the river, and when my friend moved there, we wondered how anybody could move that far. (Laughter) But it's all different now, everything is different. Phil Auerbach and I have maintained a friendship from the 1960s.    Mr. Honecker: When you were first practicing, did you recall any particular judges that you wanted to appear before?    Justice O'Hern: Judge Edward Knight, you could talk to. He was a wonderful man. I was telling Jay, I started off with Vince McCue. Vince had a lot of sickness, and I was trying to get these cases adjourned. Finally Judge Knight said to me, "Look Danny, you're going to have to try these cases. You can do it." But he was so helpful. He was a really wonderful man in those days. But calm, I can never forget the way he presided over a trial. He just twirled the gavel.    Mr. McGovern: I would assume back then you tried jury trials. How was picking a jury back then?    Justice O'Hern: Well, of course, you were permitted to question the jurors yourself.    Mr. McGovern: And then the Supreme Court changed that, and we need to get it back a little bit, I think.    Justice O'Hern: A little bit. But there were great heroes in doing that. Jim Norton, I am sure you have heard this story about him. Jim could memorize the names of the jurors so that he could look them in the eye and say, "Mrs. Smith…." He'd go through the fourteen names! But it was always a twelve-person jury, and he could memorize their names. And Justice Clifford could do that, too.    Mr. McGovern: Do you think it was a drawback to stop that procedure?    Justice O'Hern: Yes, I do, definitely. I am retired now, so I can say this. First of all, nobody made a production out of it. It was maybe an hour at most, but it was much simpler, it seemed to me. You had a simple sheet of paper, and I don't know if they still do this. You had a piece of cardboard that was printed in advance with the names of the jurors on it. But I'll tell you two stories about picking juries. I was picking a jury with Vince McCue one day, and I turned to Vince. I was looking at this juror that was sitting in front. I said, "Vince, I don't know about that woman there, I'm not sure about her." And he said, "Dan, leave her on." And at the break he went up to the Judge and said, "Can you imagine that he was going to strike this woman?" Because she was exquisitely beautiful, and they thought that would be the dumbest thing in the world. (Conversation and laughter between people here) Of course people hired Jury Consultants. But I was trying a case with a man named John Toolan. You may have heard of him, Senator Toolan, from Middlesex County. Terrific trial lawyer. I was sitting second chair with him, and we had given him the case to try. And I said to him, "Well Mr. Toolan, how do you decide who to strike and not to strike?" And he said, "I look at their faces, Dan." And I thought, oh my goodness. But I'm sure that's as good as any system.    Mr. McGovern: Yes, I happen to agree with that. Bob and I have tried cases against each other, and we know that. I guess we got to the point where you were Mayor of Red Bank. At some point, you decided in politics to support Brendan Byrne.    Justice O'Hern: Correct.    Mr. McGovern: And that turned out, I guess, to be a life-changing decision. Could you tell us about it?    Justice O'Hern: Absolutely. I recently had a farewell luncheon by the young lawyers in my office. I told again the story of the day the letter came. I was in Red Bank, doing door-to-door campaigning. And I knew that the thing people were troubled the most by was real estate taxes. They had no control over them. There were retired people, and their income wasn't going up. So I wrote the Governor a letter and told him he was on the right track. I told him to stay the course, that we needed tax reform, we've got to do this, and that people would support him. And the letter came in February, on a dark, rainy day, and it made a striking impression on him, and it changed my life.    Mr. McGovern: At that point, Governor Byrne was in some political trouble.    Justice O'Hern: No one thought he had a chance to win either the primary or the general elections.    Mr. McGovern: And they called him 'One Term Byrne' at that point. And your support really made an impression on him.    Justice O'Hern: Correct.    Mr. Honecker: He gave a speech one time and said he would walk down the street, and half of the people wouldn't waste the time to walk across and spit in his face, and the other half would. (Laughter)    Justice O'Hern: His other story was about how he used to march in the Princeton Memorial Day Parades. He knew things were changing when people raised more than one finger when they waved at him! (Laughter)    Mr. McGovern: Then you became Chief Counsel?    Justice O'Hern: I became Chief Counsel. I went to the DEP first in 1978. He was elected in November 1977. About February I started to get calls from people in Trenton. I knew Justice Handler who was then Counsel to Byrne.  So I came down and become Commissioner of the Department of Environmental Protection.     Mr. McGovern: Did you do that with some reluctance?    Justice O'Hern: I thought I was unqualified for the job. But Byrne did have an idea for the job. He thought much of it was legal, where you would have to analyze the laws and decide the permits and so forth. In retrospect, it was one of the happiest years of my life. A wonderful job! I loved it!    Mr. McGovern: That's a great time frame there, because it's probably the verging of the environmental unit. You had Silent Spring, written by Rachel Carson and then you have the establishment of the DEP in New Jersey.    Justice O'Hern: In 1971, I think, Commissioner Sullivan became the first Commissioner. He had been the Health Commissioner. And I used to say to the staff, "What did Sullivan do?" And they said, "He used to sit in there and write speeches!" Well, I wasn't much for that. I loved going to the parks, and I used to have a bunch of pictures in here of Liberty State Park, and places like that.    Mr. McGovern: How long did you stay as the Commissioner?    Justice O'Hern: Just one year.    Mr. McGovern: And the Governor then asked you to be his Council.    Justice O'Hern: Justice Pollock had been his Counsel, and he went on to Court.    Mr. McGovern: What type of issues did you deal with during your time as Governor's Counsel?    Justice O'Hern: Well, Byrne had a tremendous legislative program. The thing that really hurt Byrne's second term was Abscam, which you may not remember. But this crippled us for quite a period of time. But he got through the Pinelands Preservation Act, which was his proudest personal achievement. The creation of New Jersey Transit turned out to be a wonderful thing for the State of New Jersey. The improved train service, in my opinion, to Monmouth County has increased property values here tremendously. And bus service through other parts of the State. Those are great accomplishments.    Mr. Honecker: In regard to Abscam, Harrison Williams was the United States Senator from New Jersey, a Democratic Senator. He was caught up in that whole thing. That must have had an impact not only on you personally, but also the Democratic Party in New Jersey at the time.    Justice O'Hern: Yes, very much so. Tommy Thompson, I think they called him. He was a very powerful Congressman from Mercer County, he went down.    Mr. McGovern: Did you ever consider running for a higher office like Freeholder, Congressman or Senator?    Justice O'Hern: In Monmouth County since 1964, there wasn't much…For example, you couldn't run for Congress because Jim Howard was truly entrenched and extremely popular. I did think about it.    Mr. McGovern: And he beat Auchincloss. And they said he couldn't win, either.    Justice O'Hern: Well, when they picked Howard, he was a schoolteacher from Wall Township. But I don't think he had ever run for anything. He never gave up on it, if you know what I mean. I remember that campaign. So I just never had an opportunity to find another spot to run for. It was very hard to get elected to the Assembly in those days. Gene Bedell and Richy VanWagner caught the Watergate tide, and got that boost.    Mr. McGovern: That was during the few times that the Freeholders were Democratic here and had Democratic Legislators.    Justice O'Hern: We were proud to say that once elected, they did manage to survive a number of elections…the two Lynches…Skinny Lynch and the other Lynch. (Laughter)    Mr. McGovern: What was the decision of the Governor to name you to the Court? How was that communicated to you?    Justice O'Hern: We were sitting just the way we are sitting here, and he said to me, "Dan, do you ever think about going on the Court?" And I thought he was talking about the Superior Court. I said, "Well, I certainly thought about it." And then the conversation went on and on, and I realized that he was talking about the Supreme Court. I don't remember him actually saying that he was going to nominate me. I mean that's just the way he was, sort of casual-like.    Mr. Honecker: And the confirmation process?    Justice O'Hern: I was caught up in a little bit of internal politics here. A fellow named John Fiorino was the County Chairman. He was sort of on the outs  with the Administration in Trenton, and I somehow got caught in the middle of that. Senator Bedell at first exercised Senatorial Courtesy on the basis that it was time for a woman to be on the Supreme Court. Well, that was true, but eventually it got worked out.    Mr. McGovern: Do any particular decisions that you participated in during the many years that you were on the Court stick out?    Justice O'Hern: I have said the case that struck me the most was the Baby M Case. It had everything to it…human drama, publicity, etc. But when it was over, everybody seemed universally to accept the result. It was Solomonic  you split the child between two parents. The tensions were so high when this case started, and there was a lot of popular anger at Mrs. Whitehead. She was viewed somewhat as the villain, but she managed to put her life back together. A great judge, Judge Sween,  took over that family, and he really worked on it. He ordered Counsel and so forth. They have done pretty well.    Mr. McGovern: I have always thought that the Roth Decision about criminal sentencing was an important case because it really…    Justice O'Hern: I'm extremely proud of those sentencing decisions. I remember that term very clearly. We are talking about sentencing decisions. I had two wonderful clerks that year, and I stumbled on an intern. Somebody came in, and he had a full six months to get…The point is, we worked on that opinion for a long period of time. We studied the history of sentencing, why the Model Penal Code had been structured the way it was, and we are obviously proud that it's still pretty much the law.     Mr. McGovern: You were very close with Chief Justice Wilentz.    Justice O'Hern: Very. I wouldn't say close, but I would say extremely fond of and a great admirer of Chief Justice Wilentz. You didn't get close to Chief Justice Wilentz.    Mr. McGovern: Can you describe how it was working with him?    Justice O'Hern: I said this to him once: "You are very lucky, Chief. People think you are a pain in the tail." He had a very austere look. He wore those steel-rimmed glasses, and he was with most people extremely austere. With us, the members of the Court, it was the extreme opposite. He could do the greatest pantomime of a lawyer that you would ever see. He was amazing! He would come off the Bench and all the little idiosyncrasies that the lawyer exhibited were there! Not that this had anything to do with our decision. He had a great, great sense of humor. One of his interesting characteristics was if you were taking a trip, you told him you were going to Italy or somewhere, he would write you a long letter and tell you where to go and what to do. I collected some of these letters, and I hope to publish them some day. He would say, "Now Stewart [Pollock], I know you think you have to go to these museums, but just sit at a café, have a cup of coffee or some wine and enjoy yourself." As everybody says, he was extremely intelligent. We used to stand on what we called the 'gangway' before an oral argument, and he had so many pressures in his life. His wife was very sick. And he put a lot of time in on the administrative work, and he'd say, "I'm not too well prepared. I can't ask too many questions." And I would always say, "Don't worry, Chief. You'll get this case in thirty seconds." And he was extraordinarily quick. Without a doubt, he was the most penetrating questioner, just a fabulous questioner from the bench.    Mr. Honecker: He oversaw the tremendous growth of the Administrative Office of the Courts during his tenure as Chief Justice. And you, too, have seen it. What do you think about that?    Justice O'Hern: Well, it's very hard for me to respond to that because I never saw the way that it affected lawyers' lives. I can tell you that. When I started out, Wientraub and before him Vanderbilt, were not very popular. Ed McConnell was the Administrative Director of the Courts. And there was the same hostility of lawyers towards Ed McConnell, as later came to be displayed towards Lipscher. To me, they were just doing their jobs. I get the impression that over time, well first of all, we have a much better management structure now, and I'm sure you can sense that. The committees were appointed on management to make the Courts more business-like. So there was never an intent to monopolize anything. I, for example, did a lot of work with Family Court matters over the years. It was just a matter of training judges. You all know Ray Rainville? He was the king of Probation. And he would come into us with these ideas of appointing standing masters, hearing officers, and we always thought that was crazy. But apparently it works, and it has worked very well. So I don't think it's anything other than this. People don't want to pay a lot of money in taxes. They don't want judges doing what non-judges can do, and that has created the so-called bureaucracy. As I understand it now, non-lawyers manage the calendar for the most part.    Mr. McGovern: That's correct. You were involved in the Ethics System. Can you tell us more about that?    Justice O'Hern: This, of course, was one of Robert Wilentz's signatures. When he first came in the Court, he decided the Wilson case, which says essentially if you steal money from a client, you get disbarred. But more importantly, he could see the Ethics System was backed up, slow, and so forth. So he spearheaded the various reforms that led to the so-called Michaels Committee, and the creation of the Office of Attorney Ethics. We are still finishing that job. The question is to what extent will the in-house prosecutors replace the pro-bono attorney's prosecuting cases. But that was an abiding interest of his. Robert Wilentz had a single, dominant theme, which was public confidence in the Judiciary and the practice of law. If you look at everything he did, that was the single, dominant theme, to make sure the public had confidence in the system. And that was the Wilson Rule, and that is what's behind ethics reforms and to some extent, court reforms as well. Also of course, there came "Women in the Courts" and trailblazing things like "Minorities in the Courts " which were one of the first states to do those kinds of things.    Mr. McGovern: The Court, during the years and also recently, is well-known nationally for their scholarly opinions.    Justice O'Hern: You don't have to say that.    Mr. McGovern: I am just parroting what other people say. Do you agree with that?    Justice O'Hern: Oh, well I am prejudiced! I have said this to people. You know, we have a tremendous luxury of taking a hundred cases per year. You divide that by seven, and it's twelve and a half or thirteen opinions, which is a very manageable caseload. Robert Wilentz wrote maybe three or four opinions per year, and Chief Justice Poritz writes more. And certain members of the Court tend to be workhorses. But the point is, you can really put the time in on the cases here.    Mr. McGovern: This is maybe an improper question, but I have noticed that there have been more dissents recently, in the last year, than there have been in the prior years.    Justice O'Hern: I was accused of that. I asked a person to count them up, but I don't know. I think you saw the Star Ledger recently. They did a piece, the essence of which was the philosophy of this Court is not much different from the philosophy of Wilentz's Court. We'll have to see on that one.    Mr. McGovern: It is ever-changing as new members come on, it changes.    Justice O'Hern: Right.    Mr. Honecker: My perception is that it is not changing dramatically. It is just that individual justices have certain opinions, and that in the last month or two there have been a number of dissents. Now we have several women on the Supreme Court, which definitely is a distinct change from when you first came on the Court. We see more Assistant Prosecutors are women, more Public Defenders are women, etc. What type of impact do you think that has had?    Justice O'Hern: I think women, as you know, and forgive me for saying this, are very good at the verbal skills of the law. They write well and are extremely articulate. You are still in the trenches, so you will have to judge for yourselves how well this connects with juries. But certainly at the Appellate level, women are every bit as good as men in presenting Appellate cases. If I look at the Attorney General's Office, the Division of Criminal Appeals, you've got five, six, or seven women on the top cases. In the Attorney General's Office itself, Andrea Silkowitz is an excellent lawyer. And so is Mary Jacobsen.    Mr. McGovern: There was an article in The Law Journal this week that stated the Chief Justice has appointed more women as presiding judges, assignment judges, and to the Appellate Division.    Justice O'Hern: I'm not defending Robert Wilentz, but at the time that he started in 1979, there were simply not that many women judges with experience. The whole movement of women into law didn't start until the 1970s.    Mr. McGovern: To get more local, did you have any input into the decisions as to who would be the Assignment Judge in Monmouth County?    Justice O'Hern: No. Oh, do you mean as a Justice?    Mr. McGovern: Yes.    Justice O'Hern: Oh, of course the Chief would always ask us that. But these decisions and the Appellate Division appointments were cherished prerogatives, so to speak. He definitely made those decisions himself. I know for a fact, from talking to lawyers, that he consulted endlessly with people before making his appointments.    Mr. McGovern: I had the privilege of meeting with him and the late John Manna at his home in Deal for breakfast. He asked our opinion on who should be the Assignment Judge.    Justice O'Hern: He was tremendous for reaching out to people.    Mr. McGovern: I met with him half a dozen times during the time when I was in the hierarchy of the Bar Association. He did consult, and we would go to his Chambers in Ocean Township or to his house in Deal. Chief Justice, as I understand it from people in the State Bar, seems to share her views more with the Court and seems to be more involved.    Justice O'Hern: I can't say that we have been more involved in Assignment Judge, or Chancery decisions. In each of those cases, that's really the Chief's decision, and they make those decisions themselves. Chief Justice is obviously less autocratic than Robert Wilentz was. And of course there is something which I am not sure he would have approved, and it is the Judicial Council. If you recall the way this works, it's like a board of directors for the Court system. Their recommendations come to the Court, but the Judicial Council is extremely reliable there. A lot of the management, the day-to-day management, is handled by that group.    Mr. Honecker: From my perspective as Assistant Prosecutor, probably the most significant change I have seen is this: When I first became Assistant Prosecutor, legislature re-instituted the death penalty in New Jersey, and that's eighteen years ago. Initially the Court was criticized from several fronts in regard to its review of the Statute and its application. Where do you see it progressing?    Justice O'Hern: I'm not going to "talk out of school," so to speak. I think I wrote a case called State vs. Dixon, and about the twenty-seventh or twenty-eighth straight reversal.    Mr. McGovern: Who is counting?    Justice O'Hern: We were counting and the public was counting. But the opinion says that. But we said, essentially we said, "What can we do?" We started with a new system, and we had that problem with the burden of proof. The Statute didn't clearly say that proof had to be beyond a reasonable doubt on the State. You had six or seven reversed for that. And then the proportionality issue that is finally played out with what I regard as "returning to square one," namely that serious bodily injury...is that killing that you think the person is going to die…and then you inflict the injury. But in any event, I would say that in the first thirty-two or thirty-three cases, pretty much those were the issues. Those issues are gone, and I don't think we have reversed many lately. I wrote Nelson last term, and the Brady issue is the only issue in the case. In fact, we were stunned, and I'm not telling any secrets, there were only four point headings in the Supreme Court brief. So the issues are really reduced. Pretrial publicity is difficult in the big cases. But I would say the benefit of our exhaustive study is that the United States District Court has nothing to do. It didn't even grant a hearing to Marshall, in the case in which Marshall had 500 post-conviction relief points at stake. So I think that the clock has run out.    Mr. Honecker: And another probably significant thing is the establishment of DNA as either an investigative tool or an exclusionary tool.    Justice O'Hern: I think it offers wonderful potential. We had the Harvey case maybe three or four terms ago, and none of us was intimately familiar with DNA. And two members of the Court wrote exhaustive opinions about it. There is no doubt that it is scientifically sound, if the lab isn't cheating or something like that. Remember that from the OJ Simpson case? I think it has tremendous potential. Was it in Essex County today or yesterday that alleged rapists were released?    Mr. McGovern: There is another area of law that you have written extensively on, and that's the law against discrimination. Some of the recent cases involving Continental Airlines and E-mail were fascinating. It looked as though, when you wrote the opinion, that you immersed yourself in learning about that area.    Justice O'Hern: I love the electronic stuff. We had an unlimited contract. That meant you could sit on the machine as long as you wanted. So I got very much used to it and eventually learned the Internet. You know that sort of foolish man who put out the ad on the Internet that said, "Whites Only May Apply"? I mean what a fool to think that wouldn't be treated as any other form of communication. And that was the whole point of the Continental Airlines cases. It's no big mystery about this. The idea that the Internet is something that we can't cope with is worse, and law enforcement is going to have to deal with it.    Mr. Honecker: When you first started out, you had probably just pen and pencils. Now you have the vast knowledge of the world at your fingertips.    Justice O'Hern: My secretary started doing opinions on a mimeograph. And she said they didn't change them. If you have ever seen a corrected mimeograph, they would take a stylus maybe and put two or three little things on it. But you couldn't afford the luxury of changing it.    Mr. Honecker: It does improve the quality of one's writing.    Justice O'Hern: You think it does?    Mr. Honecker: Well, not my writing, but my wife's writing. My wife is an incredible writer.    Mr. McGovern: Does it help us think better? We would sit down and research and read the books, and now it is synopsized in some instant form on the Internet.    Justice O'Hern: A lot of people of my generation say, "I never read stuff off the Internet." But I think you can get a lot off the screen that's good. Ultimately, you know, you have to read the whole thing.    Mr. McGovern: When you started practicing, there were very dramatic distinctions between when states had jurisdiction and where you could file lawsuits and what county and everything. I tend to think now that it is very blurred because of Internet commerce. The opinion you refer to gave the illustration of a guy flying in a plane, making a deal affecting property someplace. Did you come up with that example?    Justice O'Hern: No, I got it probably off the Internet! I had a wonderful clerk this term, and she got something called the Webopedia, which is an encyclopedia of Web terms. It's amazing! But you know the fundamental skill of lawyers is still communication. And it's the same in our courts. People think oral argument doesn't count. But I found it tremendously helpful. I loved it.    Mr. Honecker: So you went from mimeograph to Internet. We are talking about long-distance learning and long-distance advocacy from different courtrooms from around the country. Do you have a projection as to where we might be?    Justice O'Hern: I can't possibly predict where we will be. I still think that this person-to-person thing is still crucial in big decisions.    Mr. McGovern: I tried a case in London last year or two years ago, and we actually took..    Justice O'Hern: Is that the one you went by yourself on?    Mr. McGovern: Yes. We took live testimony, and the witness was in California, by videoconference. There were all Courts of Justice with barristers and their wigs, and this man was in California, and they were taking his testimony live by video. I think that will happen here very soon.      New Jersey Supreme Court Justice Daniel J. O'Hern in his Red Bank Office  Mr. McGovern: This is the project Remembering the Twentieth Century for the Library, so you will be one of the featured subjects. We are going to interview a number of people for the Bar Association.    Justice O'Hern: Someone has asked me what I see in the future. It's pretty obvious that Monmouth County is one of the fastest growing counties in the State. But I think it is going to be able to retain its character. One of the great things we have here is, regardless of politics, I think, is The Board of Chosen Freeholders. The Freeholders have run a very  fine county. The park system is wonderful, and the public transportation…the trains…are excellent. The practice of law is very hard for me to assess where it will be. I participated in the Centennial History of Red Bank, and the Bicentennial in 1976. The thing that is important is that people have to have confidence. Red Bank could have gone down the chute like lots of other towns, but the people here always had confidence in the town and in themselves. And I think that is generally true of Monmouth County. There are just a few little pockets that could be improved on, but the County is always proud of itself. And I think it will do very well.    Mr. McGovern: Well, you came back, and I never left.    Mr. Honecker: And it is the best move I ever made, coming to Monmouth County. My children have grown up here, and I can say it's probably the most wonderful place in the world to live in and bring up a family.    Flora Higgins: If you had one thing you would like people who are reading or hearing this in seventy-five or 100 years, what sort of advice or commentary would you offer future generations?      Justice Daniel J. O'Hern in his Red Bank office  Justice O'Hern: The main thing is that the human being is the central piece of the universe, as we know it. That sounds so old! I am not suggesting that there is not a God, but the point is, you have to have institutions that still serve human needs. I used to be the Mayor of Red Bank, as you have heard. I have given this advice to people elected to the  highest office. What people really want is their streets cleaned, the snow plowed, and things like that. So you can never lose sight of the fact that it's families. People want to live here because they want to share this experience. We are very fortunate at this minute to look out at this beautiful river. But this has been part of the Red Bank community since it started. The very spot that we are at, Oyster Point, is where the Indians came in the summer. And there are tons of oyster shells up on the bank up here. So it's the way people want to live…they want to be connected to the community. Now you got me started on this, and I'm going to have to tell you this. You see out in front of this nice grass: this is open to the public. One of the things I resent the most about the United States Supreme Court is they have taken this very dogmatic position on 'what is a taking.' So you deprive the owner of the absolute control of the property. But this property is dedicated to the public because it was waterfront property. And very often we see people fishing out here and crabbing. It hasn't been the slightest interruption of our work. In fact, it makes it more pleasurable. So that's all that I could say. Try to make a society such that people are able to enjoy their lives.    Mr. McGovern: Thank you Justice. We really appreciate you taking your time.  
MonmouthCounty;Charles H. Maps Jr.;1921;2000;Charles H. Maps Jr., 1921, 2000            Remembering The 20th Century: An Oral History of Monmouth County      Charles Maps with his dog, Laddie  Date of Interview: August 3, 2000  Name of Interviewer: Douglas Aumack  Premises of Interview: Mr. Maps' home, West Long Branch, NJ  Birthdate of Subject: February 8, 1921    Mr. Aumack: How did you come to Monmouth and when did you come to Monmouth County?    Mr. Maps: I was born on February 8, 1921 in Long Branch, New Jersey. I have been in Monmouth County ever since.    Mr. Aumack: Were your parents from Monmouth County?    Mr. Maps: My father and mother were both born in Long Branch, New Jersey. My grandmother was born in Tinton Falls, I believe.    Mr. Aumack: Interesting. So your family has had a long history living here.    Mr. Maps: Yes. My great-great-great-great-grandfather came over from Holland in 1754, and he is buried up at the end of my street, in West Long Branch.    Mr. Aumack: What's the name of that cemetery?    Mr. Maps: I think they call it the Free Church Cemetery. It is no longer used. There was a church there, and the church was moved across the street, and has since burned.    Mr. Aumack: What was the name of this ancestor?    Mr. Maps: Michael Maps. His son Frederick Maps, fought in the Revolution, and he is buried in the same old cemetery.    Mr. Aumack: Were you brought up here?    Mr. Maps: Yes, in Long Branch. I moved to West Long Branch about thirty-two years ago.    Mr. Aumack: When you were growing up in Long Branch, where did you live? And please discuss your earliest memories of childhood in Long Branch, New Jersey.      Charles Maps on Irving Place, Long Branch. circa 1930  Mr. Maps: We lived in the uptown section of Long Branch, on Irving Place. I had a sister and a younger brother. We played around and played at night with the kids in the neighborhood. We played baseball in the street, and we played caddy in the street. I remember the milkman. He would come around once a day in a horse-drawn cart, and he'd deliver milk in glass bottles. In the winter, he'd use a sleigh when there was snow on the ground. Milk would be delivered by sleigh, drawn by a single horse. In the winter, they would leave the milk on the porch. It would get cold and semi-freeze, and the cream on the top would come squirting out the top. It would stick out one or two inches sometimes. We had a gravel road in front of the house. Many of the streets in Long Branch were gravel. They would come around with a water wagon in the summer to wet down the road to keep the dust down. And we as kids used to run behind the water wagon in our bare feet and let the water spray on our feet. Earlier it was a horse-drawn water wagon, and they'd fill the water up from a hydrant down at the end of the street. Later on it became a truck, with solid rubber tires. And we'd have a lot of fun. During storms we used to go outside, and with the water running down the gutter, we'd build little dirt dams and block the water up...things like that.    Mr. Aumack: Do you remember what year it changed from when milk and everything was delivered in horse-drawn carriages to it being delivered on trucks?    Mr. Maps: No.    Mr. Aumack:  Do you remember any other deliveries back then besides milk?    Mr. Maps: Yes, there used to be a vegetable truck that would come around to the house. My mother would buy fresh vegetables from the truck. The farmer's name was Peterson, and he used to come to the back door, and my mother would sort the vegetables she wanted. And then there was another grocery truck that came around--big, bus-like truck. I think his name was Beaver or Deaver, and he had groceries in there. He'd come to the house, and you could buy groceries from his truck. Then the iceman would come around with blocks of ice. We had an icebox then--no refrigerator. Chunks of ice kept it cool. You'd go out to the iceman when he was using an ice pick to cut up the blocks of ice into smaller pieces, and chips would fall off, and you could have a chip of ice and suck on that. And you'd have to be careful not to get any splinters because the bottom of the truck was wood.    Mr. Aumack: Oh, that's right. Did you ever get any splinters?    Mr. Maps: No, I didn't.    Mr. Aumack: That's lucky. None of your friends did, I hope.    Mr. Maps: No.    Mr. Aumack: That's good. What grammar school did you go to?    Mr. Maps: Primary school I went to Gregory School in Long Branch, and we walked. It was maybe a mile, and we'd walk in the snow and the rain. There was a freight railroad line nearby, and we used to walk down there. There was a drainage ditch right beside the railroad, and we would wear boots to school. And we'd wade through the water in the drainage ditch. Then I went to grammar school in Long Branch, which was over on Prospect Street, between Morris and Willow Avenue. It has since been torn down. And we walked there, which was about two miles. There were no buses. After that, there was junior high school in the same area, but a different building. It was the old Chattel High School building, part of it. Then we went over to Long Branch Senior High School over on Westwood Avenue.    Mr. Aumack: Is that still standing?    Mr. Maps: That's still there.    Mr. Aumack: Is that where they go for high school nowadays?    Mr. Maps: Yes, that's the present high school. And Gregory School is still there. They have added on to it since I went there.    Mr. Aumack: But they still send children there?    Mr. Maps: Yes.    Mr. Aumack: You mentioned a game called "caddy" you played when you were younger. What is that game?    Mr. Maps: Oh that was where you would take a short piece of wood, maybe four inches long. And they would put a point at each end of it, and they'd lay that on the ground. With a stick you would hit one end of it, and it would hop up into the air. And while it was up in the air, you would hit it out. It was like baseball. And then you'd run to the base and try to get back again.    Mr. Aumack: Oh, ok. What did the other people try to do when you would hit it and ran?    Mr. Maps: They were trying to catch it I guess. It was like baseball, you know.    Mr. Aumack: I never heard of that. So what did you do for fun besides play Caddy? Like what did you do for fun in high school?    Mr. Maps: In high school? We went to football games in the fall, and I had hobbies like photography for awhile. And I dated. I dated my wife...or my wife-to-be.    Mr. Aumack: Is that where you met your wife...in high school?    Mr. Maps: Yes. We didn't do a lot else. We read books.    Mr. Aumack: What kind of books did you read?    Mr. Maps: I was interested in radio at the time, so I was reading amateur radio books. I never got a license--didn't get that involved. But I didn't do too much reading of fiction. Before that when we were younger, I guess this would have been in primary school, we'd get together football games. Kids in the neighborhood would get together with the kids from down in Bridgeport, and we'd play each other in football in an empty lot nearby.    Mr. Aumack: Do you remember what your father did for a living when you were a child, and when you were older?    Mr. Maps: Yes, he started out at H.B. Sherman & Sons. He drove a coal truck and delivered coal. He also sold feed and grain for the animals in the area like horses. Later on he became president of the company, and they sold fuel oil. I remember weekends, and this must have been during the 1930s, he used to spend his weekends going out bill collecting because after the Depression era, people were in kind of tough straits. He'd work during the week, and then on weekends he would go visit and try to collect the bills.    Mr. Aumack: Did he tell you any stories about how tough it was?    Mr. Maps: No, he never discussed that at all. When I was a child I didn't even know there was a Depression.    Mr. Aumack: Oh, really. Is that because your father was president of H.B. Sherman & Sons during the Depression?    Mr. Maps: No, that was later on. He was also president of Chandler Maps Lumber Yard, which was started by my great-grandfather. He was president, but he didn't work there. He wasn't active there, just the president. When I think back, my mother made meals that weren't real fancy meals, and I guess that was during the Depression. But I enjoyed the meals, and at the time I didn't think anything of it.    Mr. Aumack: Were you about nine or ten, right?    Mr. Maps: I guess I was. Maybe ten or eleven years old.    Mr. Aumack: You had siblings, right?    Mr. Maps: Yes. I had an older sister and a younger brother.    Mr. Aumack: Do you remember what your older sister did during the Depression?    Mr. Maps: No, I don't.    Mr. Aumack: Do you recall if your mother did anything during the Depression?    Mr. Maps: She didn't work. She stayed at home and took care of the kids and the house. This isn't related to the Depression, but my father had a pickup truck that he used to go to work and come home. This was a company truck. And when he'd come home, usually my brother and I would run out to greet him and get on the running board of the truck. And as it drove into the driveway, we'd get a little ride in the driveway.    Mr. Aumack: It sounds like fun.    Mr. Maps: Yes, little things like that.    Mr. Aumack: Describe some of the places in Long Branch that your father visited.    Mr. Maps:  I remember one place he used to take the kids along. That was the grocery store down on Branchport Avenue in Long Branch. I think he went down there also to collect the mortgage. I think he loaned them money and went down there to collect payments. Every time we went down there, they'd give us an ice cream bar on a stick, my brother and I. It's funny how you remember these little things! But I didn't go much with him on his bill collecting. He went alone. It was mostly homes or businesses.    Mr. Aumack: Now you talked about the gravel road in Long Branch. Were all the roads gravel or were some of them dirt?    Mr. Maps: Some were paved...Broadway was paved with asphalt.    Mr. Aumack: Do you remember what year it was that they put down asphalt?    Mr. Maps: No, but I think it was there before my time.    Mr. Aumack: Oh, before you were born?    Mr. Maps: Yes, I think so. Branchport Avenue, I don't remember when that was paved. They had hot carts of tar...so it must have been mostly a tar road. We would get a little ball of tar and play with it in our hands. It wouldn't stick. (laughter)    Mr. Aumack: I thought you would say that your hands would stick together!    Mr. Maps: No, this was fairly firm stuff.    Mr. Aumack: So I guess they made it differently back then than they do now?    Mr. Maps: Oh yes.    Mr. Aumack: You also mentioned a freight train. Where were the tracks?      Charles Maps with his railroad timetables  Mr. Maps: Oh there was a siding from the main road, and it ran up from Washington  Street, past Branchport, and then it ran on and back, and I don't know where it ended up beyond. But it didn't go anywhere after that. There was a lumber yard nearby, and the lumber sheds were there. I guess lumber came in on the trains, and they parked the cars by the lumber yard and unloaded. And talking about trains, I remember the Blue Comet. It had a distinctive whistle, and it was painted dark blue. We kids were fascinated with that train! We used to go down and put pennies on the railroad track...I guess a lot of kids did that. You'd put pennies on the track and get them squashed.    Mr. Aumack: Was the Blue Comet a freight train with an engine?    Mr. Maps: It was an engine, yes, but it was a passenger train.    Mr. Aumack: Was it called that because it went really fast, or was it just a fun nickname?      The Blue Comet traveling through Red Bank in 1929  Mr. Maps: No, it was the Blue Comet and painted dark blue...the engine.    Mr. Aumack: Were the tracks along Ocean Avenue?    Mr. Maps: No, they came from Little Silver, and the tracks are still there. It's still the main line of the New York/Long Branch Railroad.    Mr. Aumack: So the Blue Comet went along what the New Jersey Transit uses now?    Mr. Maps: Yes.    Mr. Aumack: Oh, ok. Wow!    Mr. Maps: Then my father had a coal yard down on Clinton Avenue in Long Branch, and that was beside the railroad track. This was H.B. Sherman & Sons. They had what they call the coal pocket. The freight train would bring in the coal cars, and they would have an opening on the bottom of the car. That would drain down to a pit down below, and there was a chute-type thing or bucket thing that carried the coal up to the coal pocket. The coal was stored there. It was up high, maybe two stories high. When the circus came to town, they came early in the morning. They unloaded right there, and all the circus cars stopped on that siding. We would go down there early in the morning, my brother and I, and we'd climb up to the top of the coal pocket, up the stairway, and we'd look out and watch all the animals get unloaded. We'd watch the elephants come off, and then the elephants would pull off all the fancy circus wagons. They would put them to work. We had a good time there. We'd get up early in the morning to watch them unload.    Mr. Aumack: Was that before dawn?    Mr. Maps: That was just about dawn.    Mr. Aumack: Do you remember what year that was when the circus came?    Mr. Maps: Oh, I must have been ten or twelve years old.    Mr. Aumack: This was in about 1932, or something like that. Do you remember where they performed?    Mr. Maps: Yes, they set up the tents down in a big, empty lot off Atlantic Avenue. It was right near the river there. Sometimes we would go down and watch them set the tents up. Flannigan's Field they called it. Now it has apartment houses on it and a gasoline station.    Mr. Aumack: How long did that last? Was that a year-round thing or did it happen in the summer?    Mr. Maps: Each year in the summer, the circus came.    Mr. Aumack: Was it Ringling Bros. Circus?    Mr. Maps: It was the Coles Bros. Circus  it would come sometimes.    Mr. Aumack: Would they perform in Flannigan's Field as well?    Mr. Maps: Yes, generally.    Mr. Aumack: Tell us more about the trains.    Mr. Maps: The Blue Comet was a passenger train. And then there was a freight line siding for the lumber yard. I lived near Grand Avenue in Long Branch. Before my time it was a grand avenue, with big estates there, and people rode down that street to get to the railroad station to go back to the city. They would use that siding.    Mr. Aumack: Now when you were younger in high school, did you ever go to Asbury Park?    Mr. Maps: We would always go to the movies at Asbury Park at the Mayfair Theatre and St. James Theatre. We used to go down there to the kiddie rides...my folks would take me down. And we had fun down there. They had a fun house, Ferris wheel, peddle boats, and little motor boats on the lake.    Mr. Aumack: Do you remember the movies that you saw or anything like that?    Mr. Maps: I remember seeing Gone With the Wind.    Mr. Aumack: Which theatre did you see that at?    Mr. Maps: I saw that at one of the Asbury theatres, I don't remember which one. It was a color movie. During the fire scene of the burning of Atlanta, the curtains on the stage parted and the screen got wider, like the wide screens you have now. And that was just for that one scene. That was dramatic!    Mr. Aumack: Had you ever experienced something like that before or since?    Mr. Maps: No, that's the only time. Going back earlier, at the Broadway Theatre in Long Branch, I remember when they first had talkies when I was young. They used to have little signs with dimly lit red lights on stands inside that said "silence." That was so people could hear the talking on the screen.    Mr. Aumack: So they actually had little signs that told people to be quiet.    Mr. Maps: Yes.    Mr. Aumack: They should have those today! Do you remember seeing any famous talkies like the Jazz Singer?    Mr. Maps: No, I don't think I saw that one. They used to have stage shows. You would go to the movie, and there would be a short stage show.    Mr. Aumack: Describe that.    Mr. Maps: It's hard to remember what they were. They weren't big things...they were little acts.    Mr. Aumack: So going to the movies was not just going to the movies. It was more.    Mr. Maps: No, it was more than the movie. We used to have serials...movies that were little shorts. Each Saturday would be a different section of the serial.    Mr. Aumack: What were some of your favorite characters?    Mr. Maps: Oh, I don't remember the characters much.    Mr. Aumack: But you enjoyed them?    Mr. Maps: Yes. I remember the first time we went to the movies alone as little kids. There were about three of us on the street about the same age. We walked down to the Strand Theatre, which was across the street from the Broadway Theatre in Long Branch. We went down to see a movie called Billy the Kid. I thought it was going to be about a little goat: a "kid." But it was a cowboy picture! (laughter)    Mr. Aumack: Was that black-and-white?    Mr. Maps: Yes. That was before color.    Mr. Aumack: Was Gone With the Wind one of the first color pictures that you ever saw?    Mr. Maps: I don't think so. There was something before that, but I don't remember the names. I saw Wings, and that was a black-and-white picture.    Mr. Aumack: What was that movie about?    Mr. Maps: It was about the WWI fighter pilots. And I remember seeing All Quiet On the Western Front, and it was a black-and-white one. But I don't remember the first color picture I saw.    Mr. Aumack: Did you go to college after high school, or what did you do after high school?    Mr. Maps: I went to Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken and studied engineering. I lived in a dormitory the first year, and I joined a fraternity and lived in the fraternity house. I came home on weekends to see my girlfriend.    Mr. Aumack: That's right, to see your old, high school sweetheart! What did you do at the fraternity?    Mr. Maps: Oh we played poker, and we had a pool table down in the basement. There was a recreation room down there, and we shot pool and played poker.    Mr. Aumack: Did you play for money?    Mr. Maps: Yes, penny-ante. Not big money. Stevens Institute of Technology looked out over the river. You could see New York City at night, with all the lights. It was a nice location, up on the bluff.    Mr. Aumack: Did you go into the City when you were in college?    Mr. Maps: Yes, we used to go over there at night after class. We'd wander around and go downtown, and there was a German bar there that we went to once in awhile. I forget the name of it. We'd take the ferry over.    Mr. Aumack: Which ferry was that?    Mr. Maps: The ferry from Hoboken. We'd go to downtown, which was a couple blocks walk. We'd go to Umlands, which was a soda/snack shop, and we'd get a sandwich and a malted milk, or something like that. And on weekends I'd come home, of course.    Mr. Aumack: Did you ever go to a Yankee game?    Mr. Maps: Nope. I wasn't too interested in baseball.    Mr. Aumack: What year did you graduate, do you remember?    Mr. Maps: 1944.    Mr. Aumack: Did you think you were in danger of being drafted into the Army?    Mr. Maps: I went up for a physical, and I had had rheumatic fever, which affected my heart so I was rejected.    Mr. Aumack: Did you have that when you were a child?    Mr. Maps: I had it twice. I remember when I was a child, I was laying in bed upstairs. In the evenings during the summer, I'd hear kids out on the street playing and enjoying themselves. And there I was in bed. And sometimes I had difficulty moving because all my joints were stiff.    Mr. Aumack: What does that do to your body?    Mr. Maps: It is like rheumatism. All your joints get stiff. My jaw even got stiff, and I could barely open my mouth at one time. And it damaged my heart valves. Since then, I have had two of the valves replaced, and I have pig valves in my heart now. They call them "porcine valves."    Mr. Aumack: Do you remember how old you were when you had rheumatic fever?    Mr. Maps: The first time was in early junior high school, I think. I lost half a year of school then. The second time I had it, it was later on in junior high school I think. I was tutored in the summer, and I made up the time. So I didn't lose any school time.    Mr. Aumack: When you were at home, did the doctor come there to see you?    Mr. Maps: Oh, yes. The doctors came to the house. When I was younger I was rough-housing with my sister, and she kicked me and I fell into the iron radiator and cut my head. I remember walking down the stairs holding my cupped hands in front of me to catch the blood. They called the doctor, and he came to the house and sewed up my head. Doctors came to your house then.    Mr. Aumack: Where was the nearest hospital from your house?    Mr. Maps: It was what is now Monmouth Medical Center, and it was Monmouth Memorial Hospital then. But you didn't go to the hospital for those things. The doctor just came out and sewed you up.    Mr. Aumack: So in 1944, you graduated from college. What did you do after that?    Mr. Maps: I got a job at Federal Telephone & Radio in Newark, and I commuted by train.    Mr. Aumack: Did you use the Blue Comet?    Mr. Maps: No, I don't think it was running then. Actually the plant where I worked was right in back of Penn Station, so I could walk from the station to work. And we worked on some equipment which was being sent down to Oakridge, Tennessee. I didn't know it at that time, but I found out later that they were using that equipment to refine the uranium ore for the Atomic Bomb. That was one of the processes. They had several, but at the time, we didn't know what it was for.    Mr. Aumack: Describe more about that.    Mr. Maps: It was an induction heating machine: high frequency coils wrapped around the drum. You'd pass high frequency through it, and the induction heated the ore. I don't know that much about it. That was in a separate room, and that was all secure. I was in there once, but I didn't know much about that.    Mr. Aumack: When did you know that you were giving supplies for the atomic bomb?    Mr. Maps: After they dropped the bomb in 1945.    Mr. Aumack: How did that make you feel?    Mr. Maps: I didn't have much feeling about it. I was doing my job there. But the bomb was kind of tragic because it killed so many people. It was devastating! We went on and did other things. They turned the process into industrial use for heat-treating steel parts. We also had induction heating or dielectric heating.    Mr. Aumack: What is that?    Mr. Maps: That's where you pass high frequency between two metal plates, and it's something like a microwave. And it heats up the substance in between. I worked in the lab, and we tested different parts to see if we could treat different materials. One time they sent in a batch of dates, packaged dates. They wanted us to heat-treat it to kill all the little insect eggs in the dates, and I guess it killed them. But I didn't realize that you would eat dates that had insect eggs in them.    Mr. Aumack:  How long did you work at the plant?    Mr. Maps: Not too long...a few years. Electronic Associates was opening a business down here on Brighton Avenue, which was their first place. And I got tired of commuting, so I applied for a job with Electronic Associates. I got a job, and I got a $400 raise for switching jobs. I was making $3600 a year...big money! And I kind of grew up with the company. After about thirty-seven years with E.A.I., I retired. And now it's bankrupt.    Mr. Aumack: Oh, boy. Why do you think it became bankrupt?    Mr. Maps: The management changed, and they got into different fields. Just before I left, they were working on atomic power plant simulators. It would simulate the function of atomic power plants, and they could train operators using these simulators. They have a simulator down at Oyster Creek. There are quite a few simulators around. But designing the software for the simulators was difficult, I think. I think it was difficult to estimate the cost of it, and they weren't doing well. They got rid of some of those.    Mr. Aumack: When you were in Newark and Long Branch, what else did you do for fun when you were older? Did you still go to the Mayfair and the Strand? Did you go to the beach?    Mr. Maps: Yes, I went to the beach and bodysurfed. My heart wasn't too bad that I couldn't do things like that. We went to what we used to call North Long Branch Beach, and now they call it Northend Beach. Then it was as big as it is now, after they pumped all the sand in. When I was a kid, it was a big beach. After college, I got a job, got married, and had children.    Mr. Aumack: Do you remember where you were and what you were doing when you heard about Kennedy being assassinated?    Mr. Maps: Yes, I was standing outside my office cubicle. Somebody came in and told us he was assassinated. I was standing there outside.    Mr. Aumack: How did you feel?    Mr. Maps: I was kind of shocked, you know. It was kind of disbelief. It's funny that I remember just where I was at the time.    Mr. Aumack: A lot of people do.    Mr. Maps: I guess so.    Mr. Aumack: How has West Long Branch or Long Branch changed through the years?    Mr. Maps: Long Branch has deteriorated. The downtown section doesn't have the nice stores it used to when I was a child and an adult. West Long Branch hasn't changed a great deal. When I was young, West Long Branch was the cemetery place. Tax exempt! On Sundays, my father used to come up to the cemetery and tend to his parents' graves, and he'd bring us kids along sometimes. I remember coming up Locust Avenue from Long Branch, and that was a gravel road then. On the left side, the eastern side of it, there was a big polo field. We'd go on up to the cemetery and my father would put the plants in, and I would bring the buckets of water over to him. Sometimes we would stop and watch them play polo. I think my father sold the feed for the polo ponies. But that was interesting.    Mr. Aumack: Has West Long Branch gained anything since you have grown?    Mr. Maps: A few more stores here, but it's not a commercial town. We have a McDonalds now, or we had one, until it burned down. Now they are rebuilding it. But back then there wasn't that much in the way of business here.    Mr. Aumack: Why do you think Long Branch has deteriorated?    Mr. Maps: The mall I think. Downtown Long Branch used to have fine men's and women's clothing stores, a fur coat store, a couple of department stores, and Newburys and Woolworths. Saturdays when I was a kid, my folks would go downtown shopping in the evening. They'd take us to the five-and-ten and we'd get a little ten-cent toy. Then we'd eat in a little tearoom on Third Avenue, and we'd have supper there. It was a big event for me...for us kids!    Mr. Aumack: So the downtown was essentially the mall, because there were stores all next to each other.    Mr. Maps: Yes. There was ample parking, and you could park on the street.    Mr. Aumack: So it really wasn't overcrowded?    Mr. Maps: No. It was nice  it was fun going downtown.    Mr. Aumack: Has the traffic increased?    Mr. Maps: Oh gosh yes, oh yes! (laughter) Traffic around here in terrible now. Just trying to get out of West Palmer Avenue onto Monmouth Road now is difficult. Traffic is horrendous.    Mr. Aumack: Is it because it's overpopulated?    Mr. Maps: I think it has been built up, and Monmouth Road now is a thoroughfare from the south to the north. Broadway to Long Branch isn't that bad, because nobody goes downtown Long Branch any more.    Mr. Aumack: Because it's not what it used to be, right?    Mr. Maps: Right. People go to the mall and do their shopping there.    Mr. Aumack: What advice would you give to young people of Monmouth County, and young people in general, who will hear or read this interview?    Mr. Maps: Enjoy your life, that's it. Do things you enjoy, and help others when you can. And appreciate what you have.    Mr. Aumack: Do you remember any historical monuments in Long Branch that were taken down?    Mr. Maps: There were several in Uptown Long Branch. At the intersection of Norwood, Bath and Broadway in uptown Long Branch, there used to be a drinking fountain for horses. Then traffic got so bad that they tore it down to make it easier to turn off Broadway onto Bath Avenue or Norwood Avenue. That was dedicated to Chattel, who was the School Superintendent in Long Branch way back. In front of the old city hall in Long Branch, down on Broadway a little bit east of the railroad tracks, there was another drinking fountain for horses. On top of that was an iron horse, and I don't know what happened to that. Those are the things I liked to see around.    Mr. Aumack: I'm not sure about my history or if I'm right on this, but do you remember Long Branch before it had traffic lights?    Mr. Maps: Oh, yes.    Mr. Aumack: Describe that...what it was like.    Mr. Maps: They had policemen at the intersections directing traffic.    Mr. Aumack: And everything was ok with that?    Mr. Maps: It was fine. Traffic wasn't bad then.    Mr. Aumack: So there wasn't much to worry about then?    Mr. Maps: No.    Mr. Aumack: Is there anything you would like to add about Long Branch or that strikes you about the history of Long Branch through your eyes?    Mr. Maps: Long Branch was a nice town. I lived on Irving Place after my father died. He had turned the upstairs into a separate apartment for us to live there because my mother was ill and he wanted someone around. After we moved from that neighborhood about thirty-two years ago, I thought that the neighborhood would go downhill. But it hasn't  I was surprised. Everyone is keeping the houses up fine. It's a nice neighborhood still. But when I go back to the street, it has gotten so much narrower, in my mind. When I was small it seemed like a large street, and now it seems like a narrow street and the front yards aren't as deep as they used to be. We used to play football in my front yard, and now it's just a little thing when I look at it now.    Mr. Aumack: Everything looks so much bigger when we are young, right?    Mr. Maps: Yes. I can't think of much else.    Mr. Aumack: What did you and your wife like to do for fun when you lived here?    Mr. Maps: Well we had five children. We didn't do much. We couldn't go out to eat, because it was too expensive with five kids. We used to go out to the movies once in awhile, and my father would babysit. But we didn't do a lot. Did things around the house, you know.    Mr. Aumack: I thank you very much. It has been a pleasure, sir.    Mr. Maps: Thank you.    Mr. Aumack: You're welcome. 
MonmouthCounty;Catharine H. Hall;xxxx;2000;Catharine H. Hall, xxxx, 2000        Remembering The 20th Century: An Oral History of Monmouth County      Mr. and Mrs. Hall, 2001  Date of Interview: September 12, 2000  Name of Interviewer: Ellen Williams  Premises of Interview: Ms. Hall's home, Howell, NJ  Birthdate of Subject: N/A    Ms. Williams: Great to be here, Kay.    Ms. Hall: Thank you. I'm very glad to be here.    Ms. Williams: Thank you so much for agreeing to be interviewed. You have the wealth of knowledge about Howell and certainly have a lot of recollections in your life as a librarian and teacher and historian. Where do we begin? What's the story you want to focus on?    Ms. Hall: Oh, I don't know. For twenty-five years I was the Librarian for Ardena School. That was my whole focus. In the middle of all that came the Bicentennial, so consequently I had to learn to spin, weave, and do all sorts of things that went with the Bicentennial. So I've done a lot of things.    Ms. Williams: I understand you have also written a couple of books about Howell, the museum, and about the life here in Howell in the past. That took a lot of time  can you tell us about that?    Ms. Hall: Well, a number of years ago, some of the schools started teaching all about their townships in third grade. They decided that they wanted to do it for Howell, and I got this phone call, "Will you represent the historic part so that we have it correct?" I said yes and did not know what I was getting into. But four of us, on off hours, and in the summer, wrote this schoolbook  and this is the only school book that the third graders have. What's so unique is that it focuses on Howell, but at the end of the year the students take it home for keeps so that their family also can learn all about Howell Township.    Ms. Williams: Do you go into the schools and introduce yourself as one of the authors?    Ms. Hall: No. But I do have all the third graders that come over to the museum because I'm a docent at the McKenzie Museum, and we have bus loads of children coming in. Sometimes the teacher says, "Do you know Mrs. Hall wrote your school book investigating Howell?" And sometimes I'll just say something like, "I know you know this because I wrote it in your schoolbook." And they all kind of look at me funny, and I say, "Oh, yes, the word barter is in your book, and you should know what that means."    Ms. Williams: How many years has this been used in the third grade?    Ms. Hall: Oh, my, I really don't know. I would say over ten. But it's revised. In other words it's brought up to date, because the way you elect the mayor is different, the bus service is different, and the radio stations are different. All that changes, so it does have to be brought up to date.    Ms. Williams: Tell us about McKenzie Museum.    Ms. Hall: I thought I was going to turn out to be a history teacher, because I loved American history, and I thought to be a fifth grade teacher would be wonderful. I'm one of these late blooming people. I made the decision after I had raised four children. Before that I was a business major in Rider College, but I decided I wanted to be a teacher so I had to start out from scratch because nothing transferred. I was so busy doing that, and all of a sudden they had me go in the Library, and I thought, "I don't want to be a teacher, I want to be a Librarian." So I did. But it took me thirteen years to get my Bachelor's.    Ms. Williams: That took a lot of dedication on your part.    Ms. Hall: So this museum business is something that came up. You know, a docent is an unpaid volunteer. You work just as hard as somebody who is making a salary, maybe a little harder. For instance, this spring we had five hundred third graders come through our museum, and all Howell Township organizations and students are free. So we really work closely with Howell Township. And the schoolhouse was built in 1855  it's a lovely example of an old-fashioned one-room schoolhouse. Children can come  they can bring their class for the whole day there. I have some of them dress and pretend that that's how they're getting their schooling. Part of The McKenzie Museum is two hundred years old, which is very rare. The other part is one hundred and fifty. We've even done research on the color of the parlor, and that's the colors they are painted now. They are just the color that the woman one hundred fifty years agosaid, "This is what I want my rooms painted." We just had an oil painting and a sampler given to us  so very exciting things are happening.    Ms. Williams: What would you say are some of the most distinguishing features about Howell?    Ms. Hall: I want them to respect old buildings, and the history of their Township. And I also want them to respect older people. It ties right in. The museums are in their schoolbook, so they know what they are going to see. McKenzie Museum was a grist miller's home, and there was a very large gristmill right in our parking lot. The Manasquan River runs right there, and we're about right up to Allaire State Park. These children know quite a bit when they come. And with me knowing everything that they should know, we have very interesting talks when they come.    Ms. Williams: You're actually bringing history alive through this.    Ms. Hall: Yes. We have a lot of fun doing that.    Ms. Williams: Is your family from Howell? How long have you lived in this community?      Mr. and Mrs. Hall, present day  Ms. Hall: All of my life, except for two years. I was born in Kentucky, and my folks moved to New Jersey. My husband was born here in Howell Township. We actually sleep in the bedroom he was born in. I feel like a native.    Ms. Williams: Having all this history here, you want to share that with people.    Ms. Hall: I love it here.    Ms. Williams: Did you enjoy working with the schools as a Librarian?    Ms. Hall: When I first started I had time to bring in classes for poetry. I had mentors come and do a painting, or I had a sculptor come and show his work, or a classical guitarist come in for the day and invite the whole school down to hear him. I did a lot of crazy things in the library. I would dress in costumes and come in as an Indian one-day and, of course sometimes during the Bicentennial I mentioned, I would dress in Colonial clothes then. Now I dress in 1855 clothes because that's what the building is.    Ms. Williams: Do you act as if you're living in that era?    Ms. Hall: No, I do not interpret  I don't actually become the person. It just doesn't seem like it's conducive there for that. But I do say, "Good day," when you come  I do not say "Hello."    Ms. Williams: What about this book The Jive Talk, which was a dictionary?    Ms. Hall: Oh, I did that while I was doing my masters. I did it over at Trenton State. I've been to thirteen colleges, can you imagine? I picked up credits all over the place. I have to stop and think at which college I did what.    Ms. Williams: In New Jersey, or all over the country?    Ms. Hall:  All over New Jersey. A course here, a course there. You name the college, I went to it. I've been to them all, and enjoyed them all. Up to a lot of computer courses I took at Georgian Court. I began, I might as well tell you, right in Monmouth Junior College, which was in Long Branch High School at the time, so that really dates me.     Ms. Williams: You said earlier that you planned to become a teacher, but you decided to become a librarian  when did you want to become a teacher? Was that a lifelong interest, or was it later in life?    Ms. Hall: I guess when I had four kids. They were two, four, six and eight. In the United States we did a lot of traveling - except I've never been to Hawaii. Other than that, we have a son living in Alaska right now  we've been to Alaska a number of times, but never Hawaii.    Ms. Williams: How would you say New Jersey rates with the other states? How do you feel about living here?    Ms. Hall: Oh, I'm all for New Jersey. And all for Howell Township.    Ms. Williams: Well, I know that from your work. How about all this storytelling?    Ms. Hall: Well, that started about, I would say, seventeen years ago. I always read stories to children, but I found out that I like to look at their eyes, I like to have interaction with them, and I heard about a storytelling group in Trenton called the Garden State Storytellers. It was kind of far, and when you went there, you had to go at night. But I went. And I went for many, many, many years. They had these meetings where they teach you how to be a storyteller and then you hear all these other stories. And then you go out. I mean, most of it's free  sometimes you get paid, which is nice. I storytell now at Monmouth County Fair, and Longstreet Farm. And I tell at nursing homes. I have a lot of fun with it. Some of it is historic, some of it is teenage storytelling, and some of it is for adults. But, of course, I was a children's librarian in a K through eight school, so most of my stories I love telling to children.      Kay Hall storytelling  Ms. Williams: Do you have certain themes for your stories, certain subject matters that you tend to focus on?    Ms. Hall: For teenagers I more or less go towards important people, things I know that they'd be interested in. I have an anti-drug story that I tell. And for children, I guess it's animals. You know a storyteller picks out what she likes. And what you like might not be something anybody else likes, and you have to love the story to get into it. So now I belong to Jersey Shore Storytellers which meets in Red Bank, which isn't very far. And we have people from all around Monmouth County over there.    Ms. Williams: I imagine there's quite a variety of storytelling.    Ms. Hall: Yes, some of them are very, very good. Not professional, but almost professional. I think of myself as an amateur. I do it because I love to do it.    Ms. Williams: Do you improvise the stories, or do you pretty much know what -    Ms. Hall: Well, I have made some stories.    Ms. Williams: You obviously have the joy of teaching in the blood there. Is there anything about Monmouth County that you would like to highlight? What are you most proud of, or concerned about, or what comes to mind?    Ms. Hall: The librarians. I've worked with many different librarians, and researched in a lot of libraries. Librarianship is another way of looking at things involving people who are used to delving into things. I'm also a genealogist. We didn't even mention that. But, history just is unbelievable. My husband's folks go all the way back to the Dutch at New Amsterdam. And he has one relative who went across the river with George Washington. Genealogy makes history come to life. So the history of Monmouth County is unbelievable. And we do a lot of research. We actually go places  we just came back from Greenwich, New Jersey, where we were doing research on Governor Richard Howell. The reason we're researching him is that Howell Township is going to be celebrating its two hundredth anniversary, and it was named for Governor Richard Howell, who was a good friend of George Washington. His twin brother died right there at Battle of Monmouth, and Howell Township honored Richard Howell when he retired in 1801.    Ms. Williams: What was he like? What was his personality?    Ms. Hall: Well, I tell you, I think there he learned a few things about the Revolution. And he was one of the few men, I should say, in Greenwich, who went into somebody's cellar, and stole the tea that had been stored there because people weren't using it  they were boycotting the tea. So they put it in the middle of town and burned it. So we went to Greenwich to do the research there.    Ms. Williams: You actually went to where he was.    Ms. Hall: Yes, they have a good library there. I'm always thinking of libraries. Perhaps you didn't know that they dumped tea in Sandy Hook, also. So, we do that kind of research.    Ms. Williams: How do you think that libraries have changed over the years in terms of what they offer and how they're viewed by the public?    Ms. Hall: Well, the modern ways of copying work. In other words, you can find out what you need and then make a copy and take it home and really do your research there. That's wonderful. And the Internet, oh, we live with a computer. It's wonderful family-wise because you can talk all over. We have ten grandchildren, and they are all over the United States, and we can talk to them all the time on the Internet. And then the historical and genealogical information you can get from the Internet is amazing. It just takes a little time.    Ms. Williams: How about your family background? Where were your relatives from?    Ms. Hall: Well, they were in Kentucky, but you see all the people that were way over there, they had to come through New York, or Virginia, or Maryland, or Delaware. All these people, when you go back, have roots that go all the way back. The Reverend Gano was the minister at Valley Forge with George Washington, and he was one of the relatives. Another one was a minister who studied at Princeton, and they told me his Bible is still at Princeton. I don't know, all these little things come up when you do genealogy. I really recommend it for everybody, and I'm trying to interest all my grandchildren, because history does come alive.    Ms. Williams: And do you find that your grandchildren like to hear the stories?    Ms. Hall: Oh, yes.    Ms. Williams: Kay, tell us a little more about the genealogy research.    Ms. Hall: Well, I just learned so much about history. You learn which ancestors were killed by Indians. I recently read that one of my ancestors stopped a rebellion.    Ms. Williams: So that's where you get all your spirit.    Ms. Hall: Oh, yes, she was something. Her husband was off to the Revolutionary War so she had to stop the rebellion. Another one fought in the War of 1812. When you start doing genealogy, and you know about your ancestors, it's amazing. History just comes to life. You think, "Oh, my, that's what actually happened."    Ms. Williams: And you're teaching your grandchildren about their past?    Ms. Hall: Yes. One of the grandsons is going to be a history teacher. We really get into this.    Ms. Williams: Have they been keeping scrapbooks, too, of your family history?    Ms. Hall: Well, the one from Alaska called up and said, "Grandmother, school wants me to write something about some of my ancestors." And I said, "Well, I sent you that for Christmas last year." They went away from the phone for a moment and said, "That's exactly what I need!" They didn't even realize they had it in the house.    Ms. Williams: It's wonderful to have a librarian, an historian, for a grandmother. And your performances that you do with your husband, could you explain a little about that?      Mr. and Mrs. Hall, 1997  Ms. Hall: Okay. We work as a team, my husband, Charles and I. He does a lot of the photography, more than I do. Then we write a script and we have our shows on slides. We have never gone to the video though  it's always been slides. It's easier to cut, easier to make the show up. We've been to Ellis Island and Statue of Liberty  that's one show. Another one was when we got all dressed in our 1850 costumes and pretended that we left our museum, and that we went by boat up to Boston and visited Sturbridge, Massachusetts. So we have a whole hour at Sturbridge without any modern people in it. And we pretended all the people were our relatives, and would say, "Hello, Aunt Sue, how are you?" And we went through, "What are you doing today?" "Well, I'm grading corn husks." So that's another hour show. The cutest one was mailboxes. In Florida, there is a road  I don't know how long it is. But they have a lot of varied mailboxes, tractors and alligators, and everything. The whole show is nothing but mailboxes. I want to do one in Howell. We'd like to go around Howell Township and find the different mailboxes.    Ms. Williams: So you take pictures of the different mailboxes and do you talk about it?    Ms. Hall: Yes. You make it interesting. Some of these slide shows have music with them. This is part of being a media specialist. When you get your degree in New Jersey, you aren't considered a librarian  you're considered a media specialist. So I did a lot of this training, especially at Trenton State, and then when I got my masters at Glassboro.     Ms. Williams: So what kind of groups are looking at the slides?    Ms. Hall: We're doing cemeteries of Howell. We're doing that for the Farmingdale Historical Society this month. Up in Croyden Hall, which is in Middletown, we are doing it for the Middletown Historical Society  we're doing the one on Ellis Island and Statue of Liberty. We have a speaker come to our museum. We have monthly meetings, the Historical Society, and we trade. They can come in and give us a talk, and we come up and we have these talks we can give to them.    Ms. Williams: You're such a wonderful resource for the County. It's so rich all the teaching you are doing.    Ms. Hall: I have a cute story about that. We got an e-mail, from who I don't know exactly know, but they're in charge of the water in Monmouth County. This e-mail was a question. They were very concerned about Larrabee Crossing. Was there a bridge at Larrabee Crossing? They couldn't find it in any map, and they looked all over Monmouth County. We got a big kick out of it because Larrabee Crossing was a railroad crossing, it wasn't a river crossing. But I have been useful as a resource sometimes. My husband and I know a lot, mostly about Howell. We do a little bit of Monmouth County, but mostly Howell.    Ms. Williams: What would you say would be one of the most significant things that have happened in your lifetime, in terms of historical, either national history, or international?    Ms. Hall: When I was a little girl I remember the Hindenberg blowing up. We lived in Freehold on South Street, and we heard this big explosion. In those days people had great big furnaces in the cellar, and the noise in Freehold which came all the way from Lakehurst, sounded like the furnace had blown up in our cellar. I can remember dashing to the cellar. That night, I can remember I was supposed to be in bed asleep, but I would go over to the window that looked over the road that used to come right into Freehold, and I can remember kneeling by the window and seeing ambulance after ambulance after ambulance, because this was the main road to go New York. The rich people were hurt, and hospitals got filled up around here, and they were transporting the victims up to New York. All night long were these ambulances going by.    Ms. Williams: It must have been quite a moving experience.    Ms. Hall: When our Historical Society brought somebody in who was an expert about the Hindenberg, it was because of my interest. My father always took me to everything. Remember the Morro Castle burning off Asbury Park? I got to see that. And if a whale got beached, we went to see the whale. As a matter of fact, I saw the Hindenberg the last time it left the United States. We must have gotten up at least three, maybe four o'clock in the morning, and we drove to Lakehurst to see it leave. And the next time it came back, it blew up. So I was really interested in history way, way back.    Ms. Williams: What do you think about the times we're living in now, in terms of Howell today compared to Howell when you were growing up? What are the plusses and maybe some of the drawbacks?    Ms. Hall: Well, I think just as exciting things are happening now. The only thing is that they are happening so fast that I think that a lot of kids are missing them. They don't realize what's going on. Maybe we didn't either, but I wonder will these children remember the Bicentennial, which is so big for the United States? Two hundred years! History is moving so fast. And it's funny, but I'm more interested in olden times, so maybe the younger generation is just as interested in Korea or Vietnam, or something closer to them.    Ms. Williams: When this interview is indexed, they need to come up with some key words.    Ms. Hall: Well, I'm glad I don't have to index this!    Ms. Williams: You have such diversity in your life. What would be some of the key words be: Howell, genealogy, library history? What are some of the key words that you would want your story to be indexed as?    Ms. Hall: I'm still a librarian. I mean, once you have an education, and you're a librarian, or teacher, you're still that, no matter what. Your education, even if you retire, which I did about eight years ago, you're still that person. I have a church library in Freehold at the First Baptist Church. We have a nice little library. Then of course I run the library here at the McKenzie Museum, which is a very good research library. And then whenever we go to Florida I help out with the public library down there. So I'm still a librarian.    Ms. Williams: So you live part of the year in Florida?    Ms. Hall: Not long, but we do live part of the year, yes.    Ms. Williams: And you're involved in that library?    Ms. Hall: Oh, yes. I didn't start the genealogy until I retired. But when I got married I put a box under the bed and I said, "Anything anybody knows about genealogy I'm putting it in this box." And I kept this up about my husband's family and my family, and I knew when I retired I was really going to work on it. The other thing I wanted to do was watercolor and oil paint. And I've done both. I enjoy the painting a lot and I do it as much as I can.    Ms. Williams: Do you exhibit it?    Ms. Hall: Yes.    Ms. Williams: Where have you put your work?    Ms. Hall: At the Monmouth County Fair, and I've had it in other various places around. Right now I'm in this Manalapan Adult Center, and I will be in the Howell Library this year. They have an exhibit every year and I put my works in that. I'm getting there, but it takes a while to get to be pretty good.    Ms. Williams: If you could write a book about your life and illustrate it, what would be some of the highlights that you would want to include, or would there be one particular one you might - would you fictionalize it, or would it be a straight autobiography?    Ms. Hall: Oh, my word. I guess really, I'd specialize in history. When I first started teaching they brought in historical displays, and I was amazed that they came in and asked me to spend a week - (loud clock) there goes the clock!    Ms. Williams: How old is that clock?    Ms. Hall: That dates to about 1870.    Ms. Williams: It's great. That's perfect.    Ms. Hall: I think I love to watch my husband wind it. I think that's very historic.    Ms. Williams: Absolutely. That was perfect timing. So you would do a more historical book?    Ms. Hall: Yes, and bring in a lot of the history that I have of the Township and of our families.    Ms. Williams: So actually you are a walking history book of Howell and people really just get so much from your stories, more than any book, because you have so much to bring it to life.    Ms. Hall: Well, each year we have a lovely exhibit at Monmouth County Library - Archives Day. And each year I try to do an in depth study of something different. This year we're doing Governor Richard Howell because of Howell's two-hundreth anniversary. Last year we did the Liberty Stage Coach. Did you hear anything about the Liberty Stage Coach? This is interesting. This is a stage coach that ran from New York to Lakewood, and it ran right past our house, right in front of our house, went right through Freehold. There's a painter who painted a series of paintings on it. When we heard about the stagecoach, we heard it was up in Shelburne Museum, so we got in our car and drove to Shelburne Museum, and there's that stagecoach. So this was the whole feature of our table at the Archives. So people who want to know about a lot of history of Monmouth County can go to Archives Day, because all the Historical Societies have tables that I like to study. Each year I study something different. So that stagecoach is really a whole story on its own.    Ms. Williams: That will be one of your stories as a historian.    Ms. Hall: Oh, yes. I do some making up stories, but most of them I read.    Ms. Williams: If you could take something from Howell and put it in a time capsule and save it for someone to find later, what would you want them to have to represent Howell?     Ms. Hall: I would certainly put in the book, Investigating Howell. It's a year's work, with the four of us, and we really tried to get the essence of Howell, its history, but not just history. We also looked into the now, the government, and the shopping malls, and the fire department. In other words, it's what third graders should know about their own Township. So I think that would be a good thing to put in there. And maybe my little sketchbook. My sketchbook is about the two museums. This is the latest thing I did, and it's all drawings of the two museums  if you went to visit there you'd see all these things there. So maybe those two represent Howell.    Ms. Williams: They represent a lot of work on your part, too.    Ms. Hall: Yes.    Ms. Williams: Is there anything that encapsulates your life that you could put into a few words? What would represent your spirit?     Ms. Hall: Well, passing things on to students, passing things on to your family  I think this is very important. I feel that I've passed on a lot of my values and my love to kids.    Ms. Williams: And that kind of runs through all you've been doing in your life in terms of genealogy, and library work, and the story telling.    Ms. Hall: But also, perseverance. Some of these kids when they go to college don't realize they're lucky to have four years of college and then have a career.  I had to study for thirteen years for my bachelor's degree. I'm not too sure how long it took to get my masters, I think it was about six on top of that. And then I went on to graduate work, a lot of that in computers. The importance of education is what I'm getting at. I took the courses in the summer instead of having a job because furthering myself by going to school is how you further yourself.    Ms. Williams: You're really a lifelong learner. You're always looking to learn something new.    Ms. Hall: Oh, yes. We just took a college course this year.    Ms. Williams: What was that for?    Ms. Hall: Computer genealogy.    Ms. Williams: That's exciting because as you see a need to learn something, you just delve into it.    Ms. Hall: Oh, yes. Anything I have an interest in I try to get a course in it. We must appreciate education, appreciate history. We must respect those things. Not too far from here, they had pine robbers, and this lady during the Revolution was being robbed by this pine robber. Soldiers came, and the pine robber got scared off and jumped out the back door--but they had dug the cellar, and the pine robber fell into the cellar. All these tales that you read about to bring them to life are unbelievable. If only these houses could talk. In 1817, the house you're in right now had just the two rooms, and they added on. So there's history here. All of Monmouth County is just chock full of history. You have a funny feeling when you go out West, because their history starts so much later then ours, because white people weren't even out there then.    Ms. Williams: We are in a very historical County.    Ms. Hall: Very.    Ms. Williams: I think a lot of people like yourself are working to keep it preserved to pass it on.    Ms. Hall: And having fun doing it.    Ms. Williams: Is there anything else that you would like to highlight in your story, which is so rich, and so exciting - in terms of your family, your work experiences, that you might want to make sure we include in this?    Ms. Hall: Well, let's see. Oh, one of the interesting experiences I had was teaching the blind and handicapped in Trenton. They have a school where the students live there. They hired me to come over and story tell. It was very interesting because they couldn't see, and you can't make eye contact, so you have to present the stories in a different way. I enjoyed doing that. It was very different.    Ms. Williams: You have a very expressive voice. I can imagine it was very easy to listen to. It brings the story to life.    Ms. Hall: This is only because in Ardena School when they opened two classrooms, they took the wall out, so when I talked, I had to talk across two classrooms. So I got a really good strong voice. But it ruined my singing voice. I have a great talking voice.  I worked with the fifth grade in Ardena School, and we received a Governor's Award. East United States Coast Honor, which includes Puerto Rico even, and it's the Presidential Environmental Youth Award, and they came from Washington, D.C. to present it to the school. We went out and did environmental studies for children, pretending that they were a farmer, pretending that they were a fisherman, and the different occupations, and I did all of the videotaping for it. It was a really good show. That was very nice.    Ms. Williams: Do you still have a copy of that?    Ms. Hall: Some place.    Ms. Williams: I'd love to see it.    Ms. Hall: I don't know, maybe the school has the only copy. I don't remember if they copied it or not. We did Ardena's birthday party, which was when Ardena was fifty years old, and we even had a reunion, believe it or not, of eighth graders. They came from all over  a teacher in Princeton, and one alumni who worked with heartworm medicine. When you teach these people, you don't realize what they're going to go out and do later on. So that was interesting, too.  I also got a grant from New Jersey to do a program on the Battle of Monmouth. This is years ago, when people didn't do a lot of this, with slides and so forth. And they let me go into Monmouth County Historical Society and take pictures. We even put cloths on the bottom of our ladder so we could go up the ladder and take direct pictures of some of their paintings that they have. Somebody said, "Oh, may we take pictures too?" And they were told, "Sorry, there's no photography allowed in the museum." And she said, "Well, they're doing it." The museum person said, "But they're professionals." We did do a show many years ago on the Battle of Monmouth, which was part of the grant. A newspaper reporter who is now one of the head editors at the Asbury Park Press was very much interested in saving the North American Phalanx. That's a community where very important people lived in a community right here in Monmouth County in the nineteenth century. People might not know that. They were the first to sell a boxed cereal. It had NAP, for North American Phalanx, on it. They boxed their cereal and took it up to New York to sell. This reporter was trying to save a surviving building. He did a series of articles in the Asbury Park Press. Well, I was very much interested in it, but the building burned. It just blew my mind to think that this historical site had burned down. I mean people were going in there, and they might have caught fire accidentally. But I went in with my camera and we took slides after the fire: we also had slides from before the fire so it was called the Rape of the Phalanx. I really feel like it was ripped from our history. Once I couldn't find my copy of our publication so I went into Brookdale College and tried to borrow the copy that they had made when I was going to Brookdale, and they said, "Oh, you can't take that out because that's restricted material  it can't ever be taken out of the college." So I thought, "Oh, my." This was our slide presentation on the North American Phalanx. I've done a lot of videotaping and slides.    Ms. Williams: They saw the importance of it, didn't they?    Ms. Hall: We've had a lot of fun doing research and presenting history. We enjoy doing it.    Ms. Williams: Yes, you can tell you enjoy what you do. That comes across in everything. That's another part of your spirit - the joy of giving this history to all of us.    Ms. Hall: I think it's important.    Ms. Williams: Absolutely. Thank you so much, Kay for sharing your time with us. All the future readers and listeners of your story will be able to really benefit from this. Thank you for your time.    Ms. Hall: Oh, you're very welcome.        
MonmouthCounty;Carroll Barclay;1926;1999;Carroll Barclay, 1926, 1999    Remembering The 20th Century: An Oral History of Monmouth County   Carroll Barclay Date of Interview:  October 9, 1999 Name of Interviewer:  Lydia Wikoff Premises of Interview:  Ms. Wikoff's home, Manalapan, NJ Birthdate of subject:  May 3, 1926     Mr. Barclay:  I'm pleased to be included in what seems to be a very interesting oral history, and I think it's worth while. I hope that I can contribute something. As Lydia said, my name is Carroll Barclay, and my roots are in my grandparents' families back to the Barclays that were in Cranberry.  There was a John Barclay there at the turn of the century  he must have been about twenty or twenty-five years old at the turn of the century. He was an apple grower, and they actually called him The Apple King of New Jersey during his heyday from the early 1900s until end of the 1920s. He was interesting, as an apple grower, and I'll talk a little more about apple growing later. I'll just go through the family background first. John Barclay Sr. had three sons.  My father was Carroll  John had another son, Charles and a youngest son, John, and a daughter, Marian. They all grew up on a farm on Dye Rd. in Cranberry. The maternal side of my family was Applegate. There was Charles Richard Applegate, who was also an apple grower.  He was married to Carrie Hutchinson. Her middle name was Woodward, so that gives you some indication of the families that were involved on that side of the family. The Woodwards were from here in Monmouth County, I believe, and the Hutchinsons may have been from Mercer. The Applegates were farmers here in Monmouth County. My grandfather's father was a farmer.  I often ask my father what they did when they first came over from Scotland, and he said,  "I think they were bricklayers in Princeton."  In any case, my grandfather Applegate had a more interesting or different background in getting into apple growing. He didn't start out like I think Grandfather Barclay did. Grandfather Applegate, when he was married to Carrie Hutchinson, was in to New York and was working for a cousin in hardware, and Carrie was making hats. My mother was the first one  to be born in 1900.  She was born in New York while they were working there, and they made a decision to come out of New York. The way I was told, it was not a good place to bring up children, so they came back out to Monmouth County where they had their roots and lived in Colts Neck Township, which was Atlantic Township at that time in 1901.  They moved in with my grandmother's parents and they were sharecropping on a farm that's only about a mile from where I live in Colts Neck Township. Subsequent to that they moved and became sharecroppers on Wemrock Road in Freehold on what is now the Oakley place, as we call it. They had another child, Richard.  The children were I guess eleven months apart, my mother being born in New York and Richard being born in Monmouth County. They had another son, Leslie, who was born eleven years after my mother.  He was what we would call "second crop."    Carroll Barclay's mother, Ruth Applegate Barclay   They got their start there on the Oakley place, and there were many stories that my grandmother used to tell. But it was owned by a lawyer in Freehold by the name of Hartshorne, and he would drive out in a very expensive big automobile and pull up in the yard. And he would point to a chicken and say, "Carrie, that's a nice looking chicken there," and before he went back to town he would have a chicken and some eggs and some things out of the garden. And that just didn't set very well as my grandmother used to tell the story. It just seems though they were working for someone else and they weren't real happy about that. It's interesting how my grandfather Applegate got into fruit growing. The story goes that a hay rake broke down at the time they were on the Oakley farm.  It was just a general farm, a dairy, and crops as most Monmouth County farms were  there might have been a few apple trees out there. Yes, the story goes that the hay rake broke down one summer afternoon and my grandfather Charles Applegate went over to the Carr farm to get a repair part for it, maybe. He was gone all afternoon.  He had spent the afternoon talking with the Carrs. That farm was where the Monmouth Battlefield is, and they were close neighbors about a mile away from where my grandfather was farming. And apparently they talked all afternoon about how good it would be for Charlie Applegate to get into apple growing. I guess that was the spark that set him out to become an apple grower, and it wasn't very long after that that they stopped share cropping and bought a farm on Wemrock Road which is now part of the Battleground Park, and he planted his first apple trees. As I recall it was about 1906 or 1907  my mother would've been about seven years old. And he planted that farm, which was a very sandy farm, but it would grow apple trees, and he started his fruit growing there. Within fifteen to twenty years, Charles Applegate, my grandfather, had planted the rest of that orchard that was on the battleground and he had close to 300 acres by 1928.  Ms. Wikoff: Carroll, wasn't this called the Parsonage Farm?  It was called this because at one time our minister, William Tennent, lived there.  The house was located in the heat of the battle.  In fact, a cannonball went right through the house.   Mr. Barclay: That's right, it was called the Parsonage Farm, and when I was a young boy, I hunted on that farm and that was planted to apple trees sometime in the 1920s.  Ms. Wikoff: Did you ever find any cannonballs?  Mr. Barclay: Yes, there were always cannonballs sitting on the hearth in my uncles' homes, and they were turning them up right regularly. My grandfather also bought the farm on the corner of Wemrock Road  it was the Perrine farm on the corner of what is now old Route 33.  So, actually he owned several farms  on Wemrock Road and in that battleground area. I'm going to talk a little bit now about apple growing at that time. I see my two grandfathers as being quite different in their attitude toward the fruit business. Grandfather Barclay, known as the Apple King in New Jersey, was very, very particular. He believed that you could only grow apples if you concentrated on a small acreage, managed it very closely, and he probably did much of the work himself to get it done right.  His orchard was probably never more than thirty or forty acres. He won all the prizes at the Trenton fairs.  He won many prizes at other fairs and he was very proud of that, but you know, it didn't make a lot of money, as my father said. And actually Grandfather Barclay never, never became a very wealthy or large apple grower.  At that time, apples were grown on many of the farms. There were a lot of orchards, but most of them were twenty or twenty-five acres maybe even ten acres, and they were part of the other farming operations.  It's interesting at this point, that you would still use horse power probably, because most of it the tractors were just beginning to come in. Equipment was very limited and there were diseases to be controlled and insects and it was rather difficult.  Grandfather Applegate began to expand and see the opportunities if you could handle 100  or 200 acres. He realized that selling to New York and Philadelphia in the 1920s was very lucrative.  If you could get the volume, the apples would sell, and there was money to be made. Well, at the same time, equipment was being improved, and sprayers were  larger, and tractors became more reliable. So he saw the opportunity for more acreage and made opportunities for himself. An interesting side here is that Delicious Orchards in 1911 was named by a man the name of Fred Lerch, who came in to Monmouth County after making quite a lot of money in mining in the west. He thought that apple growing would be a great enterprise, and he hired Grandfather Barclay, who was an expert, to help him lay out the orchard that was set in 1911 in Colts Neck. Lerch got the expertise from my grandfather, but unfortunately, he didn't hire a good manager for the orchard.   Charlie Leonard tending to the original trees, 1911  So from 1911 when the orchard was planted until 1923, he got almost no fruit whatsoever. He put money into a storage and packinghouse, and of course growing the trees, and at its time, it was one of the largest orchards in the area. There may have been some in South Jersey that were as large as that, but a 100-acre apple orchard was a large orchard. Well, he put his nephew on it to manage it and it never produced any apples. And in 1923, or late 1922, he put it on the market for $50,000.  Grandfather Applegate mortgaged every farm that he had and scraped up all the money he could find and put a down payment on it. That was a lot of money in those days, but he eventually bought it when it was eleven years old in the early 1920s.  The farm, 100 acres of fruit, needed good management to make money, so he put my father on that farm to manage it along with his daughter, Ruth, my mother.  She had married Mr. Barclay from Cranberry, son of John. And he was about twenty-six years old at that time and my father knew the apple business.  My father and my mother had been married in I think 1919, so you had the marriage here of two apple growers or their daughter and son. And you had my grandfather Applegate saying here's an opportunity to take over a100 acre orchard that's in its prime years.    The Barclay Family (Carroll Barclay bottom left)  The trees were thirteen years old then.  And he was able, as I said, to buy it, and then to manage it by using the skills of his son-in-law and his daughter. And they moved into the house down on Route 537, east of Colts Neck where I live now, where I was born.  My mother moved in there in 1923. She had a very young daughter, my sister, who was only about I think sixteen months old.  This old farmhouse on Delicious Orchards was rather beautiful, but not very well equipped.  It had no water inside, it had no plumbing, and it had no heat except fireplaces, and no electricity yet, down on that road in Colts Neck.  The interesting part was that when she got married in 1919, her father Charles Applegate had built her a beautiful home with steam heat, electric, all the amenities, including bathrooms. She had lived there for three or four years prior to moving down to Delicious Orchards.  She also thought she was moving into the sticks because she had been living just outside of Freehold which was the county seat. Freehold Township and that area that they were living in was certainly a more progressive area. I don't know how to describe it, but it had good potato farms, it had good soil out west of Freehold, and wealthy farmers had moved into town in the 1800s and early 1900s.  It was a prosperous community.  It had five or six churches in it, it had The Women's Club, and I think a Cecilian Music Club, and all these things that were my mother's interests.  And here she moved down seven miles out of town, and she seemed to feel that she had left all her friends and all her interest in Freehold. Well, she was told by the Mayor of Little Silver not to worry, that she had moved into the heart of the world. And sure enough, of course Colts Neck and Scobeyville, where this farm was located, was fairly close to Red Bank where the railroad was going through or had gone through.  You had people commuting into New York already in the early 1920s from Red Bank and Rumson.  Ms. Wikoff: Carroll, could I also mention that your farm was adjacent to Laird's Distillery, which was an operation at that time.  I believe also apples could be sold there. I thought that might be of interest.  Mr. Barclay: Yes, it was right next door on the corner of Laird Rd. and Laird's Distillery was one of the major distilleries even at that time in Monmouth County and New Jersey.  About Laird's Distillery: For making applejack, Laird purchased the lowest quality apples, paying very low prices, only enough to cover handling.  For growers it was a salvage or cleanup operation.  I remember prices paid as low as twenty-five cents to fifty cents per CWT, or ten cents to twenty cents per bushel.  Top quality apples, packed and shipped to New York would bring two dollars and fifty cents to three dollars per bushel, so growers did not deliver more apples to Laird than necessary.  So my father was quite successful in making this orchard pay, and during the 1920s, farming in Monmouth County was a good business. At some time during that time, Monmouth County had the highest farm income of any county in the United States.  That was to be short lived, we might say, because the Depression came in the 1930s and apple prices dropped to one third of what they were in the 1920s. And it became very, very discouraging for my father. So discouraging that he wished he were doing something else, and by the mid 1930s, about 1936 or 1937, when I was about eleven years old, he left home.  He continued to operate the farm until the early 1940s until about the time the World War II broke out. And then there was a divorce between my mother and father. And my mother, because of the way her father's will had been set up (and he was quite wealthy when he died in 1929), she got the farm.  When she took it over, it was appraised at thirty-five thousand dollars. The mortgage, which was in trust as long as her mother lived, was thirty-three thousand dollars, so my mother started all over again in 1943 with an equity of only about five thousand dollars. Meantime, my father had profited from this wealth gotten during the good years in agriculture in Monmouth County, and he moved to Florida with the money that he had made during those years: about one hundred thousand dollars. Somewhere in there I came along.  I was born May 3, 1926. I went to the local schools. Atlantic Township wasn't noted as having the best, but we were out of the one room school situation by that time.  We had a consolidated school, and in eight grades about one hundred and twenty pupils.  When you got to eighth grade, you were bussed on into Red Bank and went to the Red Bank High School. I worked reasonably hard to make good grades in high school. And about the time my mother and father were going through the divorce process, I decided that I didn't want to take the farm with my father. So I went off to college for one year in Syracuse, actually to study to be a doctor. Subsequently, my mother got the farm and started to operate it by herself.  When I came back from college, I joined her in the enterprise of fruit growing.  This was 1944. I started in January at the tender age of seventeen.  We worked very hard to rebuild the orchard into a strong commercial orchard. It was difficult, because by this time, the original trees that were planted in 1911 were getting old and had been pretty well used up. I got my education from my uncles. Let's see, I had two uncles on my mother's side, Dick Applegate and Leslie Applegate, who were apple growers, and I had two apple growers on my father's side, John and Charles. Both my grandfathers at this point had died in 1929 when I was very young. But I got my apple orchard education from my uncles and from Rutgers Extension Service. One of the things I learned was that every apple grower had his own style and his own way of doing things. If you ask my four uncles a puzzling question, they would respond four different ways, because each one of them had different attitudes about how to run an apple orchard.  I soon found out that it had a lot to do with your personality and your attitude toward money and markets and people. And there was a lot more to it than just what was in the science of fruit growing in the book. Well, we had the benefit of some years just before World War II ended when apple prices went back up. And through the early to the late 1940s and even into 1950s, we were able, my mother and I, to plant new trees, build cold storage, buy other farms, and plant more orchards, to replace the ones that were old on Delicious Orchards. For about seventeen years we were what you would call commercial or wholesale apple growers selling to supermarkets and for export.  But the bottom fell out of the price of apples in the late 1950s, and it was very, very low prices. We were in debt due to buying farms and putting up cold storage and buying equipment. And the mortgages just became more than we could handle with the price of apples falling back into prices that were back into the 1930s. Of course in the meantime, taxes and labor were going up, in Monmouth County. And there was a decision made in the spring of 1959: we either were going to sell the farm and get out and do something else, or we would go into the retailing of fruit and cider. We made a decision, I say we, my mother, my wife, Janet, and I.  I haven't talked much about Janet, but I will. But Janet, and my mother, and I made this decision to go into the retail business. And it was quite a decision because when you're in the wholesale business, you don't have to deal with customers, and you don't have to deal with many other things that you have to do when you get into retail. And you're open Saturday and Sunday because that's where your major sales are, and it becomes a whole different way of life. So we did manage to get enough money together to build a little red building on Route 537.  The first year we started to sell cider and the apples from the farm, we were joined by my sister, and her husband, Caroline Barclay Smith and William E. Smith.  He had been a potato grower and corn grower in Freehold for quite some years, and my mother felt that he could take care of the orchards, if I took care of the retail which we did. We had a family enterprise and from 1959 to 1966 we operated out of this little red building on Route 537.  And, I think Lydia is going to add in here that we started to make pies in the farmhouse.  Pie production in the Barclay house, October 1967  Ms. Wikoff: Oh, I remember that very well. Because Carroll and Janet had been a life long friends of mine.  We had played cards, and we would get together, and Carroll and Janet had to give up their beautiful dining room because they were making their pies in their dining room, and Carroll was making donuts in the shed. And it was funny, because when we would go there, it smelled so wonderful! Those two operations just have a wonderful aroma.  But they really did sacrifice by starting to bake the pies, and of course they were so good, that it just kind of mushroomed from there, and Carroll will tell you that story.  Mr. Barclay:  There are other sources for that story, but the business did grow very, very fast. And we kind of outgrew our dining room for production of the bakery, and we were really outgrowing the red building that we had built on Route 537.  The town fathers also felt that what with the traffic that we were creating in what was really a farm zone, or I guess an agricultural zone, we should really go to the commercial zone in Colts Neck, which we did in 1966. We built the first building there.  We had an orchard that we had bought way back in the 1940s and a piece of land in that zone. We put up the first building and had to go into debt again in order to do it. It seemed like a very, very big move, and in essence it really was, but the business continued to grow, and we had to add on to that facility many times in the next ten or fifteen years.  In the 1980s, the family transferred ownership to three very strong and capable employees, and they have continued to run it and operate it very much in the same way and spirit and the quality that it always had . I'm very proud of them  they're like my own kids, so to speak. The three men who bought it were there for quite a number of years while I was operating it.  Ms. Wikoff: What were their names?  Mr. Barclay: The head, let me say, the senior partner, the older man, was Tom Gesualdo. The young fellow who had come in with Janet to the bakery was Frank McMahon.  He came out of trade school in his teens, and was probably thirty-five years old when he became partner.  Then a young fellow by the name of Bill McDonald in the produce department came to work for me when he was seventeen years old, and he took over the produce department when he was only about twenty or  twenty-one years old.  So at this time I'm speaking here, he's been there twenty-five years.  He found his wife, Linda Garrett, at Delicious Orchards and they have four beautiful children, so he's as near to being my son and his children, my grandchildren as can be.  The other part of this is, when we transferred Delicious Orchards, it was necessary to keep the orchards separate, and my son David, fourth generation fruit grower, took on that enterprise and still continues to run it.  It was originally selling all its fruit to Delicious Orchards, but he transformed it into a "pick your own" operation, where he is selling directly to the customers at retail.  Three generations of Barclays (from left to right) Carroll, Ruth, and David  Ms. Wikoff: He named that Eastmont Orchards, didn't he?  Mr. Barclay: That's named Eastmont Orchards to make a clear separation from Delicious Orchards.  Yes, that has his home on it, and it also has my house that I was born in and still live in, that my mother moved to, in 1923. David is a fourth generation Barclay or Applegate, whichever way you want, it's both sides of the family.  Ms. Wikoff:  Please tell us about the Land Preservation Program.  Mr. Barclay: I think that's important, and that was David's decision to sell the development rights and keep the land in agriculture far into the future.  Janet and I had transferred the farmland to David quite some years ago. And in fact, the final closing with the state is still pending, but he has received a citation from the Colts Neck Township, congratulating him on transferring the development rights to the to the state program. So that 100 acres of orchard, which is Eastmont and was originally Delicious Orchards, will be preserved in agriculture for a long, long while.   Ms. Wikoff: I would like to add that this home that Carroll told about that had no electricity, no running water, or anything to make it livable then, is now a treasure. It's a gem--very old and beautifully restored and we should be very proud of that home.  Mr. Barclay: Thank you. I am very pleased to be living in it.  
MonmouthCounty;Bill Williams;1931;2000;Bill Williams, 1931, 2000        Remembering the 20th Century: An Oral History of Monmouth County     Date of Interview: January 13, 2000  Name of Interviewer: Connie Paul  Premises of Interview: Mr. Williams' home, Kerrville, Texas  Birth Date of Subject: October 21, 1931    Ms. Paul: Bill, when did you come to Monmouth County, and from where did you come?    Mr. Williams: I came to Monmouth County in January of 1970, the result of a job change that brought my wife, Lew, and our small son from Colorado Springs to New Jersey. I took a position with Triangle Publications Inc. as director of labor relations, and that's what got us there.    Ms. Paul: Where were you born and raised?    Mr. Williams: I was born in Birmingham, Alabama, and I was a product of the Depression.  I was born there because that was a jumping off spot for my mother and father as they were traveling the country looking for work in the depths of the Depression. I didn't live there long, for we migrated up to Minnesota, then ultimately to Indiana.  From there I went to Gulfport, Mississippi, for high school at a military academy.  Upon graduation, I joined my mother in Waco, Texas, and lived there for twenty-four years.  I married there, had a son there, and buried my mother there.  We spent a lot of good time in New Jersey after that.    Ms. Paul: What does Triangle Publications do?    Mr. Williams: Triangle Publications, in those days, was Walter Annenburg, noted publisher in America.  He was Richard Nixon's appointee to the Court of St. James as ambassador of the United States. When I joined the company, he owned The Philadelphia Inquirer.  The Trade Division, which I joined, was a group of racing newspapers flag-shipped by The Morning Telegraph in New York City and The Daily Racing Forms across the United States and Canada.  He owned TV Guide and Seventeen Magazine.  Incidentally, he founded both TV Guide and Seventeen magazines. He owned WPIX-TV in Philadelphia and several other television stations, a stream of regular broadcast stations, and cable TV systems.  He was a very noted publisher in those days.    Ms. Paul: From where did you work?    Mr. Williams: I started out working in The Morning Telegraph offices in New York City  the first year. But I knew that I wasn't going to work there forever because we were in a process of upgrading technology and going out of the old "hot metal" newspaper mode into computerized typesetting and record keeping for the thoroughbred horse industry.  So we were contemplating building a new faculty on our own site somewhere in the central part of New Jersey.  We selected Hightstown for our new headquarters.  We started our search for our home around Princeton, and ended up in Monmouth County in Freehold Township.  Many, many times thereafter I commented that we made the right choice. We never regretted moving to Monmouth County.    Ms. Paul: Why did you pick Freehold Township?    Williams4.jpg (47504 bytes)	In 1994 Bill and Lew Williams moved from Freehold Township back to Texas.  They are shown the day before leaving at the site of the time capsule buried as part of the Tricentennial celebration.  The capsule is buried adjacent to the fountain, in back of the Freehold Township Municipal Building.    Mr. Williams: We picked that area because it was centrally located near the office in Hightstown.  Freehold Township, way back in 1971 and 1972, would have been about a twelve-minute commute to Hightstown.  When I finally left the firm in 1992, it was more like a thirty-minute commute, while still being twelve miles.    Ms. Paul: When did you switch jobs from director of labor relations to being more involved with The Daily Racing Form?    Mr. Williams:  It was a progression of jobs. I started off as the director of labor relations, and that initial year we negotiated nine labor agreements with all of our New York City unions, with all of them knowing that we were going to move the operation out of New York City.  That was a pretty tough year. And during that same period of time those who were responsible for the automation project were floundering, and the publisher asked me to take that project over. So I really had two hats, a labor relations hat, and a project director's hat.  We completed the project and I became regional general manager for Daily Racing Form.  From that I became national general manager, and then on to publisher.      Ms. Paul: Were you involved in racing before that time?    Mr. Williams: I knew which end of the horse ate the oats, but that's all.    Ms. Paul: But from there you got very involved in racing in the Monmouth County area.    Mr. Williams:  It got me involved in racing all over the United States and Canada. I quickly learned about racing and the history of racing in New Jersey and in Monmouth County particularly. Back in the 1970s, there were three thoroughbred tracks in New Jersey, in addition to the harness track in Freehold.  There was Monmouth Park, Atlantic City Race Course, and Garden State Parkway back then,  all of which were running their meetings and flourishing in those days.  I learned quickly of the history and learned of the horse breeding industry in New Jersey. There was a very active horse breeding industry in New Jersey in those days. But our primary focus wasn't just New Jersey, it was thoroughbred racing throughout the United States and Canada.    Ms. Paul: Tell me more about Monmouth Park in particular, since this is a story of Monmouth County in the 20th century.    Mr. Williams: Monmouth Park has a great and glorious history.  I believe Monmouth Park is  over 100 years old , maybe close to 150 years old. It was a premier East Coast summertime racetrack and people used to flock out of the city to Monmouth Park. They would take ferryboats and sailing boats off Manhattan and the boroughs and come down in the summer to the Jersey Shore and spend much time and money at Monmouth Park. It was a beautiful track -- one of the prettiest racetracks in America. It had a great, glorious history in terms of its racing. It offered some of the best racing during the summer months that you could find anywhere along the East Coast as well as in the United States.  And that was evidenced in those days by the crowds, the purse structure, and the type of allowance races and stakes races they ran. They had big purses, they had large crowds, they bet a lot of dollars.  They had good horses, and a good tradition.  The track is located in Oceanport.    Ms. Paul: Your longest and probably most important affiliation in Monmouth County was with CentraState Medical Center, which started out as Freehold Area Hospital. Tell me how you got involved in that, and about some of the history of that hospital.  What did it mean to the Monmouth County area?    Mr. Williams:  We moved to Freehold Township in the dead of winter in January, 1970.  We had been there a month or whatever, when one day our son got ill, and we began searching for some medical attention. We called a doctor, and he came to the house and took care of Will. From him we learned that we didn't have a local hospital, the closest being in Neptune.  It was kind of unsettling to know that this particular community, with its good schools and central location, and all the other things we thought were ideal, didn't have a hospital facility.  So one evening, while sitting in the den, watching television and reading the newspaper, my wife Lew pointed out to me a story in the paper about a meeting that was going to be held in the Borough of Freehold for those who were working to raise money to complete the fundraising campaign for Freehold Area Hospital.  She gently suggested that maybe I ought to go down and take a look at that and help them. So I did.  I'm a newcomer and all the people looked like, "Who's that guy?"  But I was greeted warmly.  I learned about their plans and learned the facts, that the people in the western part of the county had to drive to Neptune or Long Branch to get medical attention.  As the County was beginning to grow, the community leaders believed that wasn't a very satisfactory way to take care of local medical needs.  There really was a need for a hospital. So I said, "Okay, I'll sign up and see if I can help solicit some money."  I canvassed our neighborhood and our friends, and Lew and I made a pledge. I went to see my employer, and told him of our plight, and my company threw ten thousand bucks into it., or something like that.  So the folks who were putting on that campaign said, "Hey, maybe this guy can be a worker in the vineyard here."    Ms. Paul: Do you remember how much money you were trying to raise at that point initially?    Mr. Williams: I think their goal, if I'm not mistaken, was one and a half to two million dollars to finish the project. Keep in mind that that wasn't just a 1970-71 project, they had been raising money every way conceivable for ten or more years before we got there, with a view toward building a hospital. But in 1970, the hospital wasn't there yet, so shortly after we got involved, they began to construct the hospital.  I guess the next thing that Lew and I really got involved in was chairing a hospital charity ball in 1973.  We attracted the largest crowd ever to assemble in Freehold Raceway for a charity ball up to that time.  We raised the then largest amount of money they had ever raised from a charity ball, which was something close to fifty thousand dollars.  The hospital was constructed, and I remember that in order to open it they had to borrow money, because we didn't have enough money left to actually open the doors and pay a staff.  There was no cash flow.  I think they had a credit line for maybe three to five million dollars.  That's how it got started.  Shortly thereafter,  I was invited to join the Board of Trustees in 1974.  I served almost until we left, in various capacities and including every vice president's chair, president of the hospital, president of the parent corporation, also president of one of the health care subsidiaries.  We built Applewood Estates, nursing homes, assisted living facilities, child care centers, and so forth. So it was really a labor of love. I enjoyed every minute of it. It was fun to watch it grow from Freehold Area Hospital with 120 beds to what it is today with 240 to 250 beds and with every conceivable medical specialty addressed in that facility.  They now have affiliations all over and all sorts of subsidiaries.  They are quite successful.  It was a really good service  I enjoyed every minute of it.    Williams cb.jpg (83797 bytes)From 1970 until 1994 William (Bill) Williams was involved in Freehold Area-Centra State Hospital work.  His first major involvement was taking on the chairmanship of the 1973 Charity Ball.  Adopting the theme from the "Charlie Brown" of the Peanuts cartoon strip, the ball told the entire Freehold area it was their hospital with signs of "It's Your Hospital, Freehold," "It's Your Hospital, Manalapan,"  "It's Your Hospital, Marlboro," etc.  With Williams in front of a monstrous Snoopy is his wife, Lew, and Marie Rodriquez of Manalapan, who earned the title of Charity Ball Queen by raising the most money in the Queen contest.      Ms. Paul: Who were some of the people involved in the early days of that project?    Mr. Williams: The ones I remember best are Al Goldfine, he's long dead  Evelyn Silvert, who I think is still around, Charlie Miller, Joe Saker, Harold Golberger, Dr. Glen Barkalow, and Marian Friedman.    Williams 1.jpg (83430 bytes)Ground-Breaking for an early addition to Freehold Area Hospital featured the following trustees, from the left, Harold Golberger, William H (Bill) Williams, Evelyn Silvert, Alex Goldfine, Art Schreiber, Dr. Stan Becker, Marian Freedman, Dr. Sidney Tobias, Dominick Cerrato, and Joseph Saker.      Ms. Paul: What was the toughest job you did for the hospital?    Mr. Williams: I guess the toughest jobs were always the fundraising jobs. And then too, in the early days of serving on the joint credentials committee, ironing out the disputes that inevitably come between medical staff and administration, trying to decide if you had enough dollars to venture off into new medical avenues and medical treatment was always tough. It was a struggle in those early years, but it's not a struggle now.  They still deal with heavy issues, but then it was a struggle trying to make something out of nothing.    Ms. Paul: The retirement community, the extended care facility there seems to be very profitable and popular. I remember the days during the nursing shortage there when you were bringing in nurses from the Philippines.  Please comment on this.    Mr. Williams: We had doctor shortages, too.  We had to reach out and grab doctors and nurses any way we could.  We did, in fact, import some from as far away as the Philippines.  Yes, those were interesting days. We had all sorts of crusades and we had a lot of crusaders who crusaded against us. A lot of folks who were migrating down from New York and the boroughs thought you couldn't possibly get good medical care out here in the sticks. So they would spend their time, effort, and dollars to go into New York for medical care while being critical of what we offered.  I think those days are long gone. CentraState offers as good medical care as money can buy anywhere.    Ms. Paul: How did you get involved in Freehold Township politics?    Mr. Williams: I was invited by a friend to do so basically because of my many years of service on the hospital board.  My friend said there was a vacancy coming up on the Township Committee, and it's the Township Committee's prerogative to appoint a replacement.  "If we appoint you," he said, "and you would accept, you've got to do so knowing that you have to run for the remainder of the unexpired term."  So Lew and I talked about it, and I thought about it, and I said, "I might want to do that," so I did.    Ms. Paul: When was that?    Mr. Williams: It was 1984 when I accepted the appointment for a few months, and then ran in the November election and won handily.  I ran three more times for full terms and won all three of those elections.    Ms. Paul: And you were mayor periodically.    Mr. Williams: I was deputy mayor twice and mayor three times.  I served on the Planning Board for five years. We started the first Substance Abuse Task Force the township had.  We started its first Human Relations Committee and it was all in the interest of public service.  I watched the town grow both from the hospital point of view and the township point of view from about 12,000 when we came to about close to 28,000 when we left.    Ms. Paul: There was a cable TV station that started sometime then, isn't that right?    Mr. Williams: Buried in the bowels of the Township Hall, there was a Channel 33. It was a fits-and-starts operation at first, but I think now it probably does more public service programming than I remember it doing.  It sure is a good idea  a way to convey all sorts of community messages and programming to the people in the township.    Ms. Paul: Were you involved in the township when they built the Municipal Building on the corner of Schank and Stillwells?    Mr. Williams: I wasn't on the committee when they made the decision to build it, but that's where I hung my hat for many years.  Fred Jahn was the township manager, and he did an absolutely fantastic job.  Township manager is really the key employee outside of the law enforcement person.  The township manager has a lot of oversight in terms of law enforcement.  But if he's not a farsighted person capable of recognizing your strengths and your weaknesses, recognizing all the pluses and minuses as you grow, preparing the infrastructure needs, helping manage all those things, you are absolutely lost.  I don't care how good you are as committeeman, you are lost without a good township manager.    Ms. Paul: Were you on the Township Committee when the Raintree development was started?    Mr. Williams: I was on the committee during phases of the development's construction. The decision to give it final Planning Board approval was made before I joined the township committee, and the first section was under construction.  We had a lot of problems with that particular development.  Raintree was the first development of its type in Freehold Township.  We did not restrain the developers in what they tried to sell those folks in terms of the quality of life.  The township had to grapple with some of those problems and help rectify them. When you put that many people in that small an area, you're asking for some problems and you have to try and solve them.  As a closed community, the residents say, "We don't want the outsiders in here routinely.  But we want the town to take care of certain things, like our streets for example, but we don't want anybody else except us to use those streets. We want the township to come clean those streets when the snow gets on them because we pay our taxes," they say,  ''but we don't want anybody else to drive in here.  Just let the township trucks come in here and clean, but keep the general public out."  So there were all sorts of issues that we had to face.  I think most of those issues are now squared away, but yes, we dealt with them.    Ms. Paul: What about Freehold Raceway Mall, which is a big financial entity in the township now?  Were you there when that was being planned?    Mr. Williams: I was there when it was being planned.  It went before the Planning Board and I was there when the final approvals were given to it, and during its construction, and its dedication.  I had an opportunity to watch it grow. That was a major decision too, because what we really were creating was a new center of commerce for western Monmouth County.  We were saying, in effect, that the Borough of Freehold was no longer going to be the center of commerce and a new center of commerce was going to be at the corner of Route 33 and Highway 9 in Freehold Township.  And it's just not that easy to do.  You have to think in terms of the total impact on the community.  Sure there's a positive impact in terms of taxes, but there's also a negative impact in terms of traffic and people and all the demands that happen in law enforcement and so forth.  We dealt with those issues. In retrospect, I think it was a good addition to Freehold Township. The Freehold Township Committee and the Planning Board extracted something like seventeen million dollars worth of infrastructure improvements out of that developer, who said they said they had never before had to do that in any other encounter with a town. Our response for that was, "Too bad.  This is Freehold Township, and this is what we want, if you want to do business here."  They did, and I don't think they ever looked back on it either.    Ms. Paul: Why is it called Freehold Raceway Mall?    Mr. Williams: Because the property was purchased from Freehold Raceway.  It was split off from the original raceway property by the then owners of Freehold Raceway. I forget now who that was.  Freehold Raceway got into a situation where it could no longer support a huge stable area behind the track. That was where the owners and trainers would bring in truck loads of horses, stable them there, take care of them, and race them.  So they began a different program. If you were going to race your horse at Freehold Raceway, you brought it in the day of the racing, so all they really needed then were holding stables. All that property behind the racetrack, which would have been on the west side of Highway 9, was available. And the mall developers found that out and purchased it. And that's where the mall property came from, and that's why they named it Freehold Raceway Mall.    Ms. Paul:  Who are some of the memorable characters you remember and/or other people who were most influential to you while living in Monmouth County?     Mr. Williams: We had a lot of memorable characters on those original hospital boards.  We had some great entrepreneurs like the Saker family, for example.  The Silverts were memorable people.  Charlie Miller was a good friend and he was quite memorable.  Joe McLoone ran Freehold Raceway for years and years, and he was an interesting fellow.  My colleagues, and the fellow I replaced on the Freehold Township Committee, Arthur Kondrup, were colorful individuals. Another couple comes to mind now, Dante and Spats Federici, owners of Federici's Pizzeria.  When I first met Dante, I thought, that is an ugly old man with a very gruff exterior, and he's mean spirited, and he's going to be ugly to me.  Well, Dante was just the opposite.  He had a gruff exterior all right, but he had a heart as big as a house. He was gentle, he was kind, he was generous, and he was an all-around good fellow.  He was on the hospital board when I first joined the board. His brother was Frank.  Everybody knew him then by Spats.  There was a reason for that, because he used to wear spats when he was a very young man, and everybody would say, "Boy, look at those spats go down the street."  Good guys, both of them.  I have a lot of fond memories of Dante.  I can remember when he gave me ten pizzas for the auction at the Freehold Raceway Hospital Charity Ball, and those ten pizzas were large pies with all the bells and whistles on them.  They sold for $4.95 a piece. I think those days are gone. Albert Gibson also became a very close personal friend.   He was the pastor of Hope Lutheran Church -- interesting fellow, great pastor, great shepherd. He loved life, he put a lot into life, and he gave a lot of himself to a lot of people. Not only did he serve his community through the ministry of his church, he served it many, many other ways as well. Can't say enough about Albert. I found an interesting old fellow named Mack Clark, who used to be a county  extension  agent when we first arrived.  He was a member of the Methodist Church.  I remember coming out one Sunday morning and I guess we were feeling like the proverbial outsiders, and in passing I said, "Mack, how long do you have to be here in this town before people stop calling you a newcomer?"  He said, "I don't know, brother, I've only been here forty years."  Other personal friends are still there or partially there, Pete and Rochelle McCloskey come to mind.  Rochelle is a kindred spirit from Texas, and Pete, he's a kindred spirit, too, because he became a want-to-be Texan.  He met and married Rochelle in El Paso while he was in the army.  We did many, many good things with them.  They're still there hanging on.  I think of Gerry Kelly and his wife Noreen.  Gerry is one of the first people I solicited for funds for Freehold Area Hospital.  Also Jerry and Sue Gilbert.  I believe their sons still live in the area.      Ms. Paul:  Kelly was your neighbor on Kettle Creek, wasn't he?    Mr. Williams: He was my neighbor on Kettle Creek, two houses down.  He and Noreen had some little girls about the same age as our Will.  To start my hospital fundraising, I said, "I'll cut my teeth on my friend, Kelly, and see what happens."  He very generously gave a sizable pledge, and from that time we became good friends. They're wonderful people.  Gerry still has his property and spends some time there, but for all practical purposes their residence is Lake Placid, New York. Lots and lots and lots of good folks in Monmouth County.    Ms. Paul: How did Freehold Township change from the time you moved there in 1970 to when you moved away in 1994?    Mr. Williams:  The attractiveness of it became its nemesis in that it was a good place to live for those of us coming from outside the state.  We thought this was super.  It's not crowded, and it's beautiful territory, unlike any we had known.  For those who were coming down from the five boroughs it was almost like Utopia for them  they had never seen anything so great. And that stream of folks kept coming because they felt they could improve their quality of life in a more rural setting.  But they finally overran the place, and it became more of an urban setting.  I think New Jersey has always been a densely populated state, but I think Monmouth County population now is probably close to a half million people.  When we got there it was around 200,000.  So if it's close to a half million now you can see what's happened in the county in a span of twenty years. That's a lot of folks to assimilate into your way of life and your rural setting. That's a lot of infrastructure to provide, a lot of schools to build, a lot of libraries to build, and equip, and that takes a lot of doing and tax dollars for all those little towns.    Ms. Paul: What did Freehold Township do to preserve open spaces?    Mr. Williams: We bought as much property as we could whenever we could.  Freehold Township mirrored Monmouth County's initiative, in terms of administering a small tax on property for the express purpose of buying green acres and keeping them green. Through the zoning ordinances, we tried to make the density less, and green spaces greater, and you had to have more property per house. We never were able in Freehold Township to do what Colts Neck had always done, that is establish a four or five acre minimum home site. We just couldn't do that, but we did try, and the township was successful in increasing lot sizes when it zoned its master plan. That's how you try to control your growth -- you control the density of your zones.  I think we did a reasonably good job.  I'm not sure how many times they've changed the master plan since I left, but they probably have.    Ms. Paul: Wasn't there a moratorium on building for a while because of water?    Mr. Williams:  There was a moratorium on all types of construction because of inadequate sewer treatment facilities.  For many, many years, a long way back, there were a lot of septic systems.  Then they began developing package sewage plants for subdivisions, then more people kept coming and the package sewage plants weren't doing the job. If looked up and down the Manasquan River, you had town after town after town with inadequate waste water collecting and treating systems.  So the state came in and said, "Until you can figure out what to do with all the sewage you're generating in Monmouth and Ocean Counties, we're going to mandate you to put a moratorium on construction."  And so, I think for about five years there was a moratorium on construction in Freehold Township and Borough, and all over that area up and down the Manasquan River.  Finally, we got a handle on how to gather and treat sewage. From that came the formation of the Manasquan River Regional Sewage Authority and it went through fits and starts before it ever got to the point where it became a feasible, practical idea.  Everybody wanted to have their own sewage treatment plant, and everybody wanted to dump sludge some place else after they treated it.  Finally there was a meeting of minds, and we built a huge transmission line that followed the course of the Manasquan River, that took sewage gathered in Freehold Township and Freehold Borough, Howell, and other towns all the way to a huge treatment facility in Ocean County. That became a workable situation and the moratorium on construction was lifted.  But it was about five years until all that fell into place.  And then when it was finally lifted, BOOM! Building everywhere     Ms. Paul: You were involved in that Manasquan River Regional Sewer Authority too, weren't you?    Mr. Williams:  Only in terms of oversight from the Freehold Township Committee perspective.  We oversaw its budgets and had a representative on that board.  Kondrup  was township representative, and when I left, Dave Segal was the township representative.      Ms. Paul: Please comment on the landfill issue.    Mr. Williams: The landfill was a really tough issue. We had to determine what was out there and what had to be done.  As it turned out, it was one of the ten worst pollution sites in America.  Remediation for that took a lot of time, tons of money, and I'll bet you can still go out there right now and see those pumping systems working, pulling that liquid out of the ground where it was polluted, treating it, releasing it.    Ms. Paul: Did the township get federal money to help clean that up?    Mr. Williams: Federal and state. A lot of federal money, and the state had some money in the project too.    Ms. Paul: I see that there's building out in that area again.  Do you wonder if people who are building or moving out in that area know the history and background?    Mr. Williams:  The law requires you make them aware  yes, they know.  Any developer who builds, or proposes a development within a certain distance from that little pond has to make the potential purchasers aware of what's there, what took place, and what is happening.  Buyers just can't go in there blindly.    Ms. Paul:  What about the thorny issue in Freehold Township of using sludge as a potential source of energy?     Mr. Williams:  I think you have to go back and think about whether Freehold Township had a really diversified tax base. If a town has a good diversified tax base, it usually has a tax base of about sixty to seventy percent of its tax dollars raised from business and industry, and thirty to forty percent of taxes raised from homeowners.  And any time a tax base gets out of whack, the homeowner begins to complain.  If you lose some significant industries or businesses, as Freehold Township did when it lost the big glass factory, you lose a major taxpayer.    Ms. Paul: Brockway Glass.    Mr. Williams: Brockway Glass.  And there was a constant threat that the Nestle plant located in both the borough and the township was either going to cut back or relocate.  The township never had a great big industrial base, so if you take out a huge component or two, you have a problem.  And 3M also closed.  Then we really had some tax base problems.  We started thinking: how can we use this big, huge, rusty factory out here?  Can it be turned into something productive and back on the tax rolls?  A group came to us one day from Connecticut.  They had a plan to take over the glass factory.  They were acquiring rights to a process that takes sludge from sewage treatment plants, and, by using high heat and pressure, gasify the sludge.  From the gasification process you would get methanol for fuel, and you would get some sulfur that could be reused.  You also get an inert byproduct from the gasification process that could be used in road building.  This sounded pretty good.  The process was developed in East Germany right after World War II. When the Russians came into East Germany, they told the East Germans that they were going to have to stop using brown coal, which they had been using in that part of Europe for ages.  In order to heat themselves, the East Germans had to figure out what to do.  The Russians weren't going to allow them to tap into their oil and gas fuels for pipe oil and gas into East Germany from Russia.  The German scientists developed this gasification process: they took the brown coal, crushed it, and put it under high heat. They gasify it, fire it, and pull out fuel that was nonpolluting and had the inert products for other uses.  This company in Connecticut was going to acquire that process, and they felt sludge was the answer. You know, years before, there was a fuel crisis in America where people were lining up three blocks to get a tank of gas when they could get it.  Also the State of New Jersey heated sludge, dumping it in the Atlantic Ocean.  Folks had these things on their mind. And so we looked at that process as maybe something that would be beneficial in Freehold Township. Well, what we probably underestimated was the fact that the township was beginning to change in certain areas due to the influx of many new people.  We were having a younger element of folks who were first-time homeowners buying townhouses in the general proximity of that old plant, and the thought of trucking sludge in, one truck after another, was just about more than they could handle.  They didn't really want to hear the good side of the equation, about the benefits in terms of methanol and all these other things, like putting a big factory back onto the tax rolls.  That just wasn't flying, and we went through some pretty stormy public sessions. Matter of fact, we had to move out of Township Hall for public hearings.  We moved over to Adelphia School, and that gymnasium was packed with seven or eight hundred screaming folks.  So that process never happened. And then, of course, just as we were leaving, they were trying to do a deal with Nestle for a co-generation plant and the borough folks got exercised about that, and some of the same folks complained, and the co-generation idea was killed as well.  Nestle needed to cut its operating expenses, and they thought that co-generation would be a good way to do that, without too much fireworks.  They were wrong.     Ms. Paul: I remember writing you a letter one time as a Freehold Township resident.  I thought it was funny even at the time, but we had gotten a water bill one week and the next week we got a letter saying that our house was going to be foreclosed for nonpayment of our water bill, which we had had in our possession for about a week.  I remember writing a note to you, saying,  "Doesn't this seem like a drastic thing to do?"  There was a new tax assessor or a new tax person and a new computer program, and these things had been spewed out to a wide variety of people.  You came back from Christmas vacation to a stack of messages on your desk, some of which were less politely phrased than mine, I think.    Mr. Williams: Well, yours was very diplomatically phrased in comparison to some of them I got. But it was a combination of two or three problems. We had a new person heading the department, we had new equipment, new clerks, and we had new computer software.  The first thing you knew, we had people who were threatened with foreclosure of their property for not paying their water bills.  If they thought about it, it couldn't happen because you had to put a lien on property before we could foreclose it.  But people panic, and don't think rationally sometimes.      Ms. Paul:  What were some of the rewards of that time in your life?    Mr. Williams: I think one of the rewards was our park system in Freehold Township.  We had good parks and we had a good recreation program.  It grew from the early days when Al Gibson was on the Parks and Recreation Board to pocket parks and the expansion of Liberty Oaks Park and all the many programs there.  Celebrating Freehold Township's Tricentennial was fun, and a big reward.  It's not often in a lifetime that you can be a part of a tricentennial celebration!  It was one greater than the United States had experienced at that time.  That was fun, being mayor and planning it along with my wife, Lew, who chaired that committee, planning, and seeing it come to a conclusion.  Seeing the hospital flourish was a plus, too.  Also, our great circle if friends.     WilliamsDa.jpg (12823 bytes)    Freehold Township celebrated its 300th birthday in 1993.  This was the logo for the year-long celebration.  On January 23, 1993, the incoming Township Committee and officials appeared in colonial costumes.   At left is Duane Davidson, Township attorney, and William H. (Bill) Williams who was sworn in as mayor.    WilliamsDb.jpg (18887 bytes)  Ms. Paul: You got to marry people too, didn't you?    Mr. Williams: Oh, I did.  I had some memorable ones. I had some folks that could hardly speak English.  I had some folks that were so nervous they didn't know why they were there. I had a couple ride up on motorcycles.  I'll never forget that one. Two motorcycles out front and they wanted me to come out in front of Township Hall and marry them.  The young woman had on denim shorts that  had the ripped legs so all the threads were hanging down, and they were ripped pretty good, because her bottom was hanging out on one side, and she had on lace gloves and a floppy type hat, and I'm not sure what kind of blouse.  And the guy had on boots, jeans and a leather jacket.      Ms. Paul:  Well, it was her wedding, after all, you know.    Mr. Williams:  Yes, it was her wedding.  The guy was the typical leather jacket kind of guy.  So I married them out in front, on their motorcycle, and they roared off into the sunset.  I don't know if they're still together or not.    Ms. Paul: How many marriages did you perform as mayor?     Mr. Williams:  I think maybe twenty-five a year.  In Texas, we do marriages with a justice of the peace.  But in New Jersey, mayors are empowered to do that.  I did a lot in my three stints as mayor.    Ms. Paul:  Did you have any or do you have any responsibilities to the state?    Mr. Williams: No, not really, because of home rule.  You don't have a lot of responsibilities to the state as such, except there's always a constant argument about the legislature enacting all these new laws that they feel are so great. You know,  when you really think about it, this was an additional intrusion into your life.  The state would tell the towns and the counties, "This is a great idea.  We're going to put it in effect, and you pay for it."  So the constant battle for state mandate/state pays was always going on, and it was always a budget-impacting situation. The state would come down with all this nonsense and they would expect the counties and towns to pay for it, and you had to figure out a way to do that.  A constant battle.    Ms. Paul: You were one of eight municipalities in that Regional High School District.  Please comment on that.    Mr. Williams: We tried to find our way out of that, too.  We opposed the thought of a new high school in Colts Neck as being unnecessary. The township initiated the litigation to try to stop that, but it was unsuccessful.  Many times there were discussions about how to foster a break-up of the regional system, but that really wasn't a feasible thing to do.  There wasn't anything that could have been done by the township and governing body.  And if I look back on it now, the regional system seems pretty good.  If I look on it now and see how they administered that regional system, and what they accomplished, and how they lowered the taxes in support of that system, it seems feasible.  I see what we do here in Texas.  In this county right now we have four separate school systems in a county that's forty miles long.  We should have one administrative system covering all the schools wherever they are. I can see a lot of positives about the way we did it in New Jersey, and a lot of negatives about the way we do it here.    Ms. Paul: Comparing Kerrville, Texas, and Monmouth County: What do you think are or were the pluses and minuses of Monmouth County?    Mr. Williams: If I look back on the almost twenty-four years we were in New Jersey, I would have to say it was a damn good experience. We chose the right place to live. We were there at the right time. We watched the town grow in an orderly fashion. We made many, many good friends. We had the privilege and opportunity to serve in places that were meaningful and those were all good experiences. I can truthfully say right now, though, I would not want to live there now.  It's just the way things have developed. I'm more comfortable living in a more rural setting, not having all the impact problems that I'm sure the governing body in Freehold Township and the borough and all those other towns face now. I wouldn't want to be there now, but it was a good experience. I don't regret it. If I could be conveyed back to 1970, I guess I'd do it all over again.    Ms. Paul: Thank you for all of the things you did, and thank you for this interview.    Mr. Williams: You're welcome.   
MonmouthCounty;Bernice Eisenberg;1927;1999;Bernice Eisenberg, 1927, 1999    Remembering the 20th Century: An Oral History of Monmouth County   Bernice Sacks Eisenberg: photographed as Miss Senior Monmouth County, 1996. Date of Interview: September 23, 1999   Name of Interviewer: Flora Higgins Premises of Interview: Ms. Eisenberg's home,  Ocean, NJ   Birthdate of Subject: August 20, 1927 Ms. Eisenberg:    Good morning, Flora.  Ms. Higgins:   It's very pleasant for me to be here this morning and to talk about Long Branch and the twentieth century.  What perhaps is your most salient memory?  What would you like to tell us about this morning?  Ms. Eisenberg:    I think I would like to talk about my parents and the hotel business that they were in, in Long Branch, on the boardwalk.  In the end of this story, there will be three hotels that they bought, or built, or managed in the course of their entire marriage.   Ms. Higgins:   That's wonderful.  What are the hotels?  Are they still there?  Ms. Eisenberg:    No hotel is there.  Every one of them, that is the Vendome, seems to have burned down for one reason or another.  But not when they were in our possession. They were on Ocean Avenue across from the boardwalk, when Ocean Avenue was a beautiful, double-sided street with an island in the middle with lampposts, where women walked in evening gowns on Saturday night on the arm of their gentlemen.  And some of these people stayed in our hotel.  Ms. Higgins:   I always think of Long Branch with that Winslow Homer painting, with the women in those beautiful dresses.  What years were your parents involved in the hotel business?  Ms. Eisenberg:    My father came over from Russia about 1900 and the family lived in New York in a walk-up.  And my uncle, who became an ear, nose, and throat specialist, said to me, that he said to himself, “How does a poor boy like you think he's going to become a doctor?”  But he did.  And somehow the family ended up in Long Branch.  There were other relatives here.  And they bought a boarding house on Ocean Avenue.  I think the land extended all the way to Second Avenue or close to it. And I heard that there were cows grazing in the backyard.  And the story goes that one day my grandfather, Ruben Sacks, went to New York and came back and found that my father, Irving Sacks, had knocked down a wall of the building, because he decided that he was going to make it bigger.  He was perfectly capable of doing that.  And in the end they built the hotel for the Ocean Plaza.  And I was born August 20, 1927.  And I think in those days they would have kept my mother in the hospital a week. I would have been brought back - did I say August 27th to that Ocean Plaza on Ocean Avenue, Long Branch.  Ms. Higgins:   Do you have any memories of it?  Ms. Eisenberg:    I was there long enough to be a little girl.  I remember the music room and an upright piano.  And I remember in the dining room these little lanterns along the wall with orange shades that lit up when the bulb was lit.  And that's a little girl's memory.  And that's all I remember.  Ms. Higgins:   Do you remember going into the ocean? Did they go bathe?  Ms. Eisenberg:    You know I see only pictures of that.  And I see pictures of, perhaps, Winslow Homer's paintings of people on the beach in what we would call clothing.  Lots of clothing.  Men even with suits, and shirts, ties, and hats.   Ms. Higgins:   In the water?  Ms. Eisenberg:    No, no, no.  On the sand, on the sand.  And the ladies with their long dresses.  And men who went in the water wore a sleeveless shirt and boxer shorts and that would be how they would dress to go in the water.   Ms. Higgins:       Women?  Ms. Eisenberg:    Women would wear a blouse and a skirt.   Ms. Higgins:   Blouse?  Ms. Eisenberg:    And I only know this from pictures, which anybody would know.  Ms. Higgins:   Um-hmm.  And they'd sit on the sand and then...  Ms. Eisenberg:    And then I wondered how they got their clothes cleaned.  Ms. Higgins:   Yes, and dry, let alone clean.  What kind of clientele did your parents have?       Hotels along Ocean Avenue, (CIRCA 1930).  The structure with the flag is the HOTEL VENDOME.  The part of the structure underneath the hotel was a gambling house equipped with extremely large windows and secret buttons that revealed secret panels that enabled patrons to make a quick escape in case of a police raid  gambling was illegal at this time.  To the right is the PLAGER COTTAGE, a boarding house, (no longer standing), to the far right are the SCARBORO HOTEL, (no longer standing).   Ms. Eisenberg:    If you go back to the older days when I was a little girl, I don't know.  But I will tell you that when I was older - a teenager, I have a recollection of seeing a man sitting in our lobby.  And this is now the second hotel which is the Vendome, and which is in the middle of the boardwalk, just about the exact middle of the boardwalk.  And we had families who would come in June, make their arrangements for the entire season and just stay there, and come back for twenty years.   Ms. Higgins:   Wow!  Ms. Eisenberg:    So they were like cousins to me and I did grow up with them.  So that I knew all of them.  And if there was a stranger there, I would notice that.  There was a nightclub built on the corner of Brighton Avenue and some of the entertainers stayed in our hotel.  So I did see this gentleman sitting alone in a chair and I went up to him.  I was an early teenager, I'd say.  And I said, “Are you an entertainer at the nightclub?”  And he said, “Well, I'd like to be but I have to go to an audition and I don't think I'm going to do very well.”  And I said, “Well, that's no attitude to take.  You're not going to do well if you think you're not going to do well.  You have to have a better attitude.”  And my mother came over and said to him, “The kid gave you some good advice, didn't she?” He was Sam Harris, producer of George M. Cohan. But I didn't advise Hank Greenberg on how to play baseball.     The Hotel Vendome, located on Ocean and Howland Avenues.  The hotel was purchased by Irving Sacks (Bernice's father) in the 1940s.  Among those who stayed here were the Ambassador from the country of Santa Domingo, baseball revolutionary Hank Greenberg, the producer of George M. Cohan: Sam Harris, and owners of famous New York night clubs: Leon and Eddies, and the Copa Cabana.   Ms. Higgins:   He was there, too?  Ms. Eisenberg:    His parents came every year.  They were the tallest people you ever saw.   Ms. Higgins:   How would you entertain yourselves in the evenings when it would rain, or what would people do there in the hotel on a rainy day?  Ms. Eisenberg:    We entertained ourselves in the evening by having an orchestra, which also came back every year for many years.  It consisted of a violinist, a drummer, and a pianist and they were all women.   Ms. Higgins:   That's very unusual.  Ms. Eisenberg:    And the drummer and the violinist were sisters.   Ms. Higgins:   Now may I assume that they got to stay at the hotel for free while they entertained the customers?  Ms. Eisenberg:       Absolutely.  They lived there the entire summer.  Anybody who worked there stayed there and lived there and ate there.   Ms. Higgins:   A very nice arrangement for everyone.  Ms. Eisenberg:    Oh, sure. We had many college boys.  We had a young man who was a busboy, I believe, who met a Long Branch girl, married her, is here today.  Her father owns Siegel's Men's Shop on Broadway.  He was studying to be an accountant.  He married Mr. Siegel's daughter  his name is Sol Laperdon.  And he and his wife, Sarah, had clothing stores in this area until about a month ago when they closed up their last store in Red Bank on Broad Street.  Ms. Higgins:   What store did they own in Red Bank?  Ms. Eisenberg:    It was a combination men's shop and women's shop, right near where Monmouth Street meets Broad.  And I don't know the name of it.   Ms. Higgins:   When Long Branch was in its heyday it certainly had some very famous people come and go. I have seen people trying to name the seven presidents over and over.  Can you name the seven presidents?  Ms. Eisenberg:    No, but I know where to get the information.  People carry it around, but not in their heads.  They carry it around on a sweatshirt.  Ms. Higgins:   Really?  Ms. Eisenberg:    From the Long Branch Historical Association and I believe the front of it says, “Who are the seven presidents?” and they are listed on the back of that shirt.  Ms. Higgins:   I must get one of those shirts.  Ms. Eisenberg:    And the president of the Long Branch Historical Association is Robin Levin of Long Branch, of course.  And she works very closely with her mother, Joanne.  And it's a very active organization.  They're now taking over the Church Street School in North Long Branch.   Ms. Higgins:   Where did you go to school?  When all the summer people went home and the New Jersey gloomy winter descended, then where did you all go to school?  Ms. Eisenberg:    Long Branch - well, when you get to the high school, Long Branch High School.  All of the Long Branch schools, starting with Garfield, which by the way was named after one of our presidents.  Ms. Higgins:   There's one.  Ms. Eisenberg:    From Garfield to junior high, which became the Anastasia School.  Now, in the winter we lived on Pavilion Avenue in Long Branch in a house which my father built with his own hands, 165 Pavilion Avenue, opposite Monmouth Memorial Hospital, at that time.  That is now Monmouth Medical Center.  Ms. Higgins:   Right.  But that was Monmouth Memorial…  Ms. Eisenberg:    Yes.  Ms. Higgins:   Since when?  Ms. Eisenberg:    Well, my brother was born there.  If he were alive now, he would be about seventy-seven.  And it was called Monmouth Memorial Hospital at that time.  Ms. Higgins:   Well, the mention of presidents here, it's beginning to occur to me that one of those presidents was the one that had the child out-of-wedlock?  Ms. Eisenberg:    But I don't know who that is.  Ms. Higgins:   But at any rate, the mother was supposed to have been in a hotel, put into a hotel in Long Branch, and the child…  I wonder if that was one of your hotels?  Ms. Eisenberg:    Not that I ever heard of.  I think not.  I think not.  Ms. Higgins:   I think you would have known.  Ms. Eisenberg:    I'll tell you who did stay there.  We had nightclub owners from some of the famous nightclubs in New York. Such as Jack Entrator who owned the Tropicana, and Leon from Leon and Eddie's who ended up in my bed.  Is that okay to have recorded?  Ms. Higgins:   Sure.  Ms. Eisenberg:    He ended up in my bed.  Except that I wasn't there.  Ms. Higgins:   All right.  Ms. Eisenberg:       Because the hotel was full and he came up to my mother and asked her, “Do you have a room?” “No, only my daughter's.” She threw me out of my bed  I don't remember where I slept that night.  And he slept in my bed and left his tie in the morning.  And she did not charge him and I'll tell you why.  On my twentieth birthday in 1947, my uncle, the ear, nose, and throat specialist in New York, for my birthday gift, was to give me a tonsillectomy.   Ms. Higgins:   Ouch.  Ms. Eisenberg:    Ouch.  And mother asked Leon if he would pick me up at the hospital in New York and take me to his apartment to recuperate.  And that is why she didn't charge him and that's why she gave him the room.  And his daughter did come and pick me up and I did stay there over a weekend to recuperate.  Ms. Higgins:   Do you remember the tonsillectomy?  Ms. Eisenberg:    I remember very well because I was not put to sleep, I sat in a chair.  And, well, general anesthetic is not the safest thing, and my uncle knew that he could do it with a local anesthetic.  And the main thing I remember is him saying, you know, "You're going to feel some needles in your tonsils," and that's how I was anesthetized.  And I sat up the whole time.  And what was also interesting about it is they took me from my room to the O.R. on a gurney and had me walk back.  Ms. Higgins:   That is very interesting.  Ms. Eisenberg:    My uncle sent someone with me.  It might have been his assistant, but it wasn't a man who walked me back to my room.   Ms. Higgins:   I remember to this day my tonsillectomy, which was about the same timeframe.  I was born in 1934 and I was about eight or nine when I had it.  But it hurt.  It hurt for days.  I felt very betrayed because I had been told you'll wake up and have ice cream.  But, I never got any ice cream.  Ms. Eisenberg:    I never did either. I didn't want any. And I will say that my uncle - in connection with Long Branch is that my younger brother, who's seven-and-a-half years younger than I am, was an infant when he contracted streptococcus. And we called Dr. Strauss who lived down the street on Pavilion Avenue in Long Branch, too.  He was an ear, nose, and - we had a lot of different specialists.  In fact, he delivered me.  And then he became eye, ear, nose, and throat.  So he was called and I guess he couldn't help my brother and there was a private nurse on duty that I remember, and my uncle came down from New York and my brother, Raymond, was the first one in Monmouth County to have the sulfa drugs.  Ms. Higgins:   Really.  Ms. Eisenberg:    Yes. And he's here today.   Ms. Higgins:   Good, I'm glad.  You apparently went back to college after graduating from Long Branch High School.  Did you start college and then return or...?  Ms. Eisenberg:    I have to explain that.  I started college and I was in Monmouth Junior College when I met Julian Eisenberg, just back from World War II. There were nineteen people in the class, a girl who was kind of a bookworm, a girl who was engaged, and me.  So I didn't have a lot of competition.  And we both needed to go to college. So we did get married and I intended to finish college in Chicago, because he was going to Chicago College of Optometry.  But I promptly got pregnant and have at this moment a fifty year-old daughter. And I had three more children.  I had four children in eight years.  Ms. Higgins:   That kept you very busy, I'm sure.  Ms. Eisenberg:    And when the youngest was two, and the oldest was ten, I went back to Monmouth College at night, taking one course at a time.  Ms. Higgins:   What were you studying?  What was your area?  Ms. Eisenberg:    I have a major in English and Education.   Ms. Higgins:   That's wonderful and I see that you did graduate and went on to be a teacher.  Ms. Eisenberg:    Yes.  So, you see by the picture that I showed you, which was taken by the Asbury Park Press, because Mama didn't go to school at that time like she does now.  Ms. Higgins:   No, Mama didn't.  That must have been very arduous, coming home and taking care of the children and...  Ms. Eisenberg:    I figured out how to do it.  I let the beds be unmade  I let the dishes sit in the sink.  And I did my homework and studying first.  And loved every minute of it.  And it got me away from the house and the diapers.   Ms. Higgins:   And Monmouth College then went in your experience from a junior college to college and now, the university.   Ms. Eisenberg:    I watched it grow - I remember when it was a girls' school.  Ms. Higgins:   I didn't know it had been.  Ms. Eisenberg:    It was exclusive girls' school, that is Shadow Lawn.  Monmouth Junior College started in high school at night about 4:00 o'clock.  And that is when I went, from 4:00 to 10:00.  And at that time the property on Shadow Lawn, New Jersey was an exclusive girls' school.  And then Monmouth Junior College moved over to the property where they are now.  And became a college.  Ms. Higgins:   And its area of expertise is education.  They have a very strong school of education.  They always have.  Ms. Eisenberg:    And a lot of other schools, too.  Ms. Higgins:   And a lot of other schools, now, too.  The county has always been helpful with the junior college, but I think Monmouth College being private, they probably didn't get help from the county or the state?  Ms. Eisenberg:    I have no idea, even though I did work there. I worked as a sub-professional in the library in the periodicals department.  Ms. Higgins:   You must remember Joy, who was the librarian there for years and years and years.  And along the way developed one of the finest periodical collections in the state.  Ms. Eisenberg:    I do still see Hilda Webb. Hilda Webb was the librarian there and Gertrude Reinach.   Ms. Higgins:   Joy Osborne?  Ms. Eisenberg:    Oh, Joy Osborne. Oh, her real name was Jocelyn. Oh, yes.  Ah, yes.  Oh, sure.  I worked with her - that's how I know.  Ms. Higgins:   That's what I would have thought.  Bernice Eisenberg surrounded by her family on graduation day  Bernice Eisenberg surrounded by her family on graduation day  Ms. Eisenberg:    Right, yes, right.  And I want to say that her son graduated from college the same day I did.   Ms. Higgins:   Really?  Ms. Eisenberg:    But I was the bigger celebrity - they printed my picture, not his.  Ms. Higgins:   Well, that's a very nice picture with your four children around you.  Ms. Eisenberg:    Oh, I love it.  And my husband.  Ms. Higgins:   Of course, your husband so proudly putting on the graduation cap.  Ms. Eisenberg:    Yes.  Ms. Higgins:   Do you have one salient memory of Long Branch which you would like to have preserved in this oral history? And it doesn't have to be the only one, but just maybe a fond memory.  Ms. Eisenberg:    When I was an adult, I went down to the beach.  I say that the ocean and the sand are in my blood.  I say I was born on the beach.  And I went up to the water, just to the very edge, and I rolled up into a ball.  And I just let the water do what it wanted with me.  And when I came out, a stranger came up to me and she said, you must have been around here a long time.  Ms. Higgins:   You rolled up like part of the beach.  Ms. Eisenberg:    Part of the water, just let the waves do what they wanted.  Ms. Higgins:   Where do go to the beach now, when you go?  Ms. Eisenberg:    Well, being a senior citizen, now I can go down to Long Branch beach for free.  My problem is that this year since they have filled out the sand, it looks like a mile to me, from the bottom step to the water.  And I'm not getting any younger and that sand can be hot and I think I'll be exhausted by the time I get there.  So when I went to the beach this year, I did go to the Philip Avenue Beach in Long Branch, which has a little boardwalk out, which is not so large and which has facilities without climbing up a big flight of stairs.  But this summer I also worked the Ocean Township Pool in the front entrance where I had to see people's membership cards or else they had to buy a membership.  Ms. Higgins:   We enjoy the Seven Presidents' Park.  But that too has gotten filled out.  Maybe after the storm it'll be easier for us to get to the water.  Ms. Eisenberg:    I would like to go down there, too.  That's where you drive in and they have facilities and everything's on the level, which I like.  Ms. Higgins:   Yes, it's a beautiful beach, it's very well maintained by the county and we enjoy it a lot, and I hope to see you there sometime.  Ms. Eisenberg:    All right.  I'll look for you.  Ms. Higgins:   Well, we talked about your graduation from college.  That certainly must have been a milestone in your life.  Can you think of any others that you would like to tell us about?  Ms. Eisenberg:    Every time you ask me of a memory, my mind flashes back to my life in the hotel.   Ms. Higgins:   Good.  Tell us more about that.  Ms. Eisenberg:    I had a formal sixteenth birthday party.  All the young men were away at war.  Except at that time, my first boyfriend, who lived in Red Bank, was still around before he went into the Army, and his cousin.  And we had broken up, but I sent him an invitation.  I sent out fancy, engraved invitations to him and his cousin.  And it turned out that his cousin came, and when I saw this boyfriend years later, who by the way, became - not years later, but a year later - became mayor of Holmdel, he said, “You invited my cousin and not me.”  It seemed that he never got the invitation.  Ms. Higgins:   Oh, dear.  Ms. Eisenberg:    Now, I don't know what happened to the soldiers, whether they got their invitations or not.  But I knew two soldiers and I told them I was having this party and they said, “We'll give you the company address and you can send invitations to the soldiers.”  Well, the night of the party, the two that I met, came.  None of the others came and when the two saw that no one else was there, they said we'll go find them.  And if I had any brains I would have known that they weren't going to go all the way to Fort Monmouth and round up these soldiers.  But at that time I believed everything everybody said.  And they left and never came back, either.   Ms. Higgins:   So you and the girls had your party.  Ms. Eisenberg:    I think maybe some of those girls did not have a very good time.  I don't know.  They didn't get a lot of opportunity to come into the hotel.  The local people didn't come into the hotel.  And they probably rode by and looked in and wondered what it was like.  So that did give them that opportunity.   So they did come in and they were in gowns and they brought me very nice presents.  And there was food, and there was a band.  And maybe in that respect, I hope they had a good time.  Nobody ever said.  I still see some of them.  Ms. Higgins:   What do you think of, not only Long Branch, but Monmouth County, New Jersey, the world.  What can you offer us on that?  Ms. Eisenberg:    Well, Long Branch isn't what it used to be.  And my brother moved to Santa Barbara, California and when he and his wife came back for a visit, he went out of his way to keep his wife from seeing Broadway, Long Branch.  It just isn't what it used to be, like a lot of places.  I see in the paper that they keep talking about a comeback.  We're happy that the Hilton built here.  And I think there's some action on the Armory, they're talking about making that an amusement area.  They got tired of Ocean Avenue falling down into the beach.  And so there is no longer an Ocean Avenue that you can drive from one end to the other.  And we now have Ocean Boulevard, which is now a bit inland.  Ms. Higgins:   One of the Long Branch institutions that went inland with the boardwalk was Max's.  Ms. Eisenberg:    Yes, Max's.  I saw his wife the other day at our synagogue.  I was on the Donahue Show with Mrs. Max.  We had a bus trip to the Donahue Show and she was interviewed and so was I, so, we both got to be on television.  Ms. Higgins:   What did you say?  Ms. Eisenberg:    You know, I said something on national TV that I didn't want anybody to know.   Bernice Eisenberg and her nephew, Robert Pinsky Ms. Higgins:   There you go.  We can erase this  you can't erase national TV.  Ms. Eisenberg:    And it seems that my friend's daughter was watching television and I came on, and she said, “Mom, that's Bernice.”  And everybody was so startled that nobody knows what I said.  They were so busy saying, “That's Bernice on the Donahue Show.” So I got away with it. Well, Robert Pinsky, who is my husband's nephew, really, and he's mine through marriage, called a book of his, The Figured Wheel, and there was a poem by that name and it's about the wheel of chance on, I think, the Long Branch boardwalk.  It's about that wheel with all the numbers on it that they would spin and you would try to win a toy.  Ms. Higgins:   Oh, sure.  It was a lot of fun.  It was innocent, good-time fun, and then we'd end up at Max's for the corn on the cob.  Ms. Eisenberg:       Another memory I have of the stand is that some of our guests from New York liked this area so much they moved down here.  One of them was named Alan Goldenthal, who ended up doing a radio program on the Long Branch station, where I also appeared, because he asked me ,”What contributions did your parents make to the city of Long Branch?”  Well, he knew very well, having grown up in our hotel, one of the people who stayed there year after year after year.   Ms. Higgins:   Well, those old hotels in Long Branch, I remember pictures of them.  I think they were pretty much gone by the 1960s.   Ms. Eisenberg:    Ah, yes.  What happened with our first hotel is the Depression came along and we lost it.  Now, in the middle of Ocean Avenue sat the Vendome, closed up, condemned, taken over, I think for taxes, by the city of Long Branch.  And my mother went to the commissioners and said, you have an empty, boarded-up hotel there.  If you will let us have it, the first season rent-free, my husband will stay there all winter and put it back in shape.  I think that was the winter that my mother's brother had to put coal in our furnace.  Yes, I think we were pretty much out of money.   Ms. Higgins:   Now that's a great story.  Ms. Eisenberg:    And that was originally Phil Daly's gambling house.  Ms. Higgins:   Oh, before it had been boarded up? And was gambling legal?  Ms. Eisenberg:   No. The dining room was round. The dining room was magnificent and I have a picture of it.  And it was perfectly round  all in a dome was a hand-painted picture of a horse race.  Just magnificent.  Now, it had a lot of decorations, and at my height, a lot of little round things, about eye level for me, around the room.  And a lot of panels.  Well, some of those little round things were buttons and some of those panels were doors.  And they opened up and led under the porch, so that you could escape if there was a raid.  Ms. Higgins:   Oh, my goodness.  Ms. Eisenberg:    Now, someone I know who's interested in Long Branch history said the story he got is that the very large windows opened up and you could get out of a window.  Ms. Higgins:   Well, your parents made it a more conventional hotel.  Ms. Eisenberg:   Absolutely.  And I do want to tell you one story about that dining room and that construction.  The children used to eat in the children's dining room an hour before the parents so the parents could enjoy their dinner.  There were no children in the main dining room  we had counselors to take care of them.  Can you imagine the parents sitting in the dining room and looking way up at the windows, way up high in the dome and seeing their children looking down at them?   Because my oldest brother, who was a devil from the day he was born, led them up the ladder which was up the dome to reach the flagpole.  And there was a roof there, which went all the way around and windows, which went all the way around, and all the children were looking down at their parents.  And then you can imagine how terrified they got.  I just like to visualize that.  Ms. Higgins:   I do, too.  And the kids so delighted.  You weren't there?  Ms. Eisenberg:    Oh, no.  I was a very good, quiet kid.  In fact, I have a book, Grandma's Memories, and you open the pages and it asks you questions.  And one of them was, was there some kind of private place you went?  And on the hotel grounds, was a large, round bush, way over my head and it was completely hollow in the inside.  And children like to have a clubhouse and that was our clubhouse.  Ms. Higgins:   That's a secret garden.  Ms. Eisenberg:    Yes, and that was my place.  And our place.   Ms. Higgins:   I bet it was lovely and cool - 'cause in Long Branch it's always cool.  Ms. Eisenberg:    Yes, well, I was fortunate to be on the oceanfront in the summertime.  Ms. Higgins:   How would people get back and forth from there?  Ms. Eisenberg:    My father had a vehicle that he called the suburban.  It was the first station wagon I remember.  Visitors came on a train.  I don't have a memory of a lot of cars.  They came on a train.  And then when the train would come in, my father would send some driver with the suburban to pick them up.  Ms. Higgins:   How luxurious, in that time that was very luxurious.  Ms. Eisenberg:    Rainy days we would also load up the suburban and take the children to the movies.  Now I have to tell you this.  We took the children to the movies  I was one of them.  We go to leave and get back into the suburban, and for some reason we can't sit.  We can't all get back in.  So one man said, okay, everybody get on the sidewalk.  And he said, now, you sit in the back seat in the middle, and you sit in the back seat on the right side, and you sit in the back seat on the left side.  And he got us all in and he was a meatpacker.  I love that story.  Ms. Higgins:   I do, too.  Another Long Branch institution is Monmouth Park.  Ms. Eisenberg:    I don't know a thing about it.  In fact, after I was married and we bought a house on Broadway and West Long Branch, I could hear the races being called from my backyard.  And it was year after year after year that we never went there.  And I said to my husband, “I think maybe we ought to go once.”  So we went and oh, oh, I bet across the board which is win, place, and show.  Ms. Higgins:   Six dollars?  Ms. Eisenberg:    Um-hmm.  And I won and I got four dollars.  So I said to the teller, “I won and I got four dollars?”  And the next thing I know a security guard took me away.   Ms. Higgins:   Good heavens!  Ms. Eisenberg:    And my husband said to the security guard, “I'll explain it to her.”  And it was like, my horse didn't win, it like, showed.  My husband wanted to explain.  Ms. Higgins:   He jumped right in on that, he must have -  Ms. Eisenberg:    You know, they don't - you're not to argue with them  Ms. Higgins:   No, I guess not.  I'm sure they thought you were somebody from a gang.  Ms. Eisenberg:  I was going to cause some trouble, and they wanted not to discuss it with me.  Ms. Higgins:   And your husband just started explaining.  What part of your life would you like to relive if you had a decade that you could relive?  Ms. Eisenberg:    I know that most people say that teen age was a horror.  It wasn't for me.  Ms. Higgins:   Good.  Ms. Eisenberg:    I enjoyed high school.  I was, I have to say in the best class, I had wonderful classmates.  We formed a little sorority  they made me the president.  I always thought because it was in my house.  You know.  Ms. Higgins:   And your house was very roomy being a hotel, right?  Ms. Eisenberg:    No, no, in the winter we lived in a house.  Ms. Higgins:   Okay.  Ms. Eisenberg:    But, you know, I was the hostess,   is what it was, I think, being modest.  I was the hostess and I thought that that was the reason they picked me for president.  And we all ate together in the cafeteria.  And I had this wonderful nucleus of friends who all became professionals.  All, we all went our way to college.  Also, I would like to relive the early years of my marriage, 'cause I - well, you know, it was a real love affair and it was wonderful in the beginning.  And we had four children, which, you know, really puts a strain and a drain on things.  But that love affair and the beginning of my marriage was really wonderful.   Ms. Higgins:   I can tell just the way he's putting this cap on you how proud he is of your graduation from Monmouth College.  Ms. Eisenberg:    And little did I know that I was going to be a widow.  I was forty-eight when my husband died.  And I say I was left with four children, but they were not little children.  The youngest, actually, was eighteen.  So at the time, I had two in college, no one was employed, and a pension. And my husband had become an optometrist and when he died my son and I tried to continue the practice by hiring an optometrist, and having my son work as an optician, because we always added to the Pinsky family who are all opticians.  Ms. Higgins:   Oh, I didn't know that.  Ms. Eisenberg:    We had one poet laureate and about four or five opticians.   Ms. Higgins:     Everybody seeing things.  Ms. Eisenberg:    But we couldn't keep it up for long and I had to sell the practice.  And then go on my way.  I took a job at Fort Monmouth.  Ms. Higgins:   And you were a teacher, as well.  Tell us about those two jobs, if you will, please.  Ms. Eisenberg:    The teaching - when I was graduated from Monmouth and about in 1960, I took a job as a teacher in Asbury Park High School.  I had to be there 7:30 in the morning.  I had four small children.  I went down a complete size, which everybody might say, good, but for me I, I went down to about a seven, I think.  The principal called me in and said look what you look like, the skin was hanging on my neck.  And Mildred Pinsky told me I looked sick.   Ms. Higgins:   Lot of work.  Ms. Eisenberg:    It was more than I could handle, but I finished the year.  After that I became a substitute teacher. I did sign up every place and it was fun to go back to Long Branch High School and go into the teachers' room in the place where I wasn't allowed when I was one of the students. In fact, I was talking in the room and a teacher told me to keep quiet because she thought I was one of the kids.  And the principal, Dorothy Howland, I think her name was, not the principal, sorry, but the school secretary, told me that I was the most requested substitute.   Ms. Higgins:   That's very nice to have on your record.  Ms. Eisenberg:       However, I narrowed it down to Ocean Township School System.  I was a substitute there for a very long time.  And I loved every minute of it.  I had good control.  I always taught the class.  And the mayor, the present mayor of Ocean Township, where I live now, was one of the students in my class while I was a substitute, and he remembers me well.  And he once held up a political meeting to come over and give me a kiss on the cheek and then go and start the meeting.   Ms. Higgins:   Even though I went to school a long time ago, and things were a lot better disciplined then, I can remember how cruel we were to substitutes.  Ms. Eisenberg:    Yes.  Ms. Higgins:   You must have indeed been a very fine teacher.  Ms. Eisenberg:    Well, I kind of had this stern face and I do have this loud voice.  And I had disciplined four children of my own.  Ms. Higgins:   Yes, that would help, too.  Ms. Eisenberg:    And I just never let anything get out of hand, at all. One of my students from Asbury Park High School is now principal of Howell High School.  She's in Who's Who In Education, she's a customer of my son, who is an optician in Freehold at Glen Marks Eye Care, Craig Road.  And she came in to him and said, “Your mother never yelled no matter how bad they got.”  Actually, I don't recall that they ever got bad, cause I always nipped it right in the bud.  And I would reason with them  as a substitute, I would say, “Now if I were a visitor in your house, you'd offer me a cup of coffee.  Well, I'm a visitor in this classroom.  Your teacher is sick and I need your help and cooperation.”  And then they would understand that.   Ms. Higgins:   What stories did you hear at the time that were handed down to you from previous generations that you might like to tell us?  Ms. Eisenberg:    Well, I'd like to tell you about my grandmother, my father's mother.  Ms. Higgins:   Please do.  Ms. Eisenberg:    And the first hotel, which was the Ocean Plaza.  My guess is at that time they didn't hire a chef like they did.  I don't know but what I heard is that she worked very hard.  And that she was such a good woman that even though she had five children of her own, she took in an orphan child.  She was very religious.  And you know, in the true sense of the word.  In fact a robber, a former employee, came back with an accomplice to rob the hotel, and my grandmother caught them. The employee said to his accomplice, ”Don't harm her.” Well, I have to tell you that one Saturday morning she was walking back from synagogue with a lady and they were talking and they did not hear a lone train car coming down the track and it hit both of them.  Ms. Higgins:   Oh, dear.  Ms. Eisenberg:    Yes.  The other lady lost her arm and my grandmother suffered in the hospital a couple of days and died.  And that I heard, you know, of course, many, many, many years later.  My older brother is named after her, and he's six years older than I am.  So she was dead a very long time before, probably seven years before I was born.   Ms. Higgins:   What advice would you like to give to present and future generations?  Ms. Eisenberg:    I have come to the philosophy of life at this point where I try to enjoy every day.  I can't do anything about getting older.  I appreciate every birthday, instead of saying, oh, another birthday, I say, I'm lucky to have gotten another birthday.  And so I live my life to the fullest and try to enjoy every day.  I'm a little worried about how the country and the world look now.  There's a phrase, "man's inhumanity to man."  And every time I turn on the radio or the television that is what I'm hearing.  I have no idea what to do about it.  This country is trying to do something - President Clinton made a speech here today at the United Nations, saying this has got to stop, and we have got to help, and it's up to each country, for their people to behave like human beings.  And I hope it gets better, but it doesn't look good at the moment.  I hate to be pessimistic.  Ms. Higgins:   What are your feelings as we enter the millennium?  Is this a big occasion for you or is it just another New Year's Eve ?  Actually it's not the millennium until 2001, but...  Ms. Eisenberg:    But, but the computers think it is.  Ms. Higgins:   The computers definitely think it is.  Ms. Eisenberg:    And I think is going to be a very interesting New Year's Eve, not like any other.  And I personally am storing water.  I have had my chimney cleaned out and my fireplace so I can light a fire.  Somebody has promised me he's got a lot of wood he'd like to give me.  I'm keeping my bank statement. My son just made sure to pay off a credit card so they don't say that he owes 100 years' interest.  Ms. Higgins:   Yes, things could get very interesting.  Ms. Eisenberg:    We just had a major storm and they're saying that's good practice for the Y2K, that's what they're calling it.  And nobody knows, I think they can't tell us that it's going to be a fiasco because we would all get hysterical.  I say that that's the same reason they don't tell us the aliens have landed. And they're telling us for the most part using guarded language that everything's going to be fine, but that remains to be seen.  Ms. Higgins:   When you were at Fort Monmouth - I'm back up to that for a minute, because of what you were saying about things being kept from us. Were you working at Fort Monmouth during the McCarthy era?  Ms. Eisenberg:    Oh no, I was not working there at that time.  My son, Glenn, was born at that time and he's forty-seven. I remember it because I remember being on the lawn outside of our apartment complex and striking up a conversation with a neighbor, and saying, “What do you think of the McCarthy hearings?”  And she said, “It's best not to talk about it if your husband works at Fort Monmouth.” So it was like Russia.  It was like people were afraid.  I understand that the people that they picked on- who were accused of having some associations perhaps back in their childhood, even,  were the Jewish engineers and one African-American man.  I met the lawyers who defended them.  The lawyers were told please don't use anti-Semitism as a defense.  Well, the lawyers got disgusted.  That was Harry Green and Ira Katchen, who  were the lawyers, who did this pro bono, all for free. And they got so disgusted with the way the trial was being run on Fort Monmouth, in a military court  that one of them threatened to call the press. And so the judge said, "No, no, don't do that.  We'll shape up, we'll do it your way."  And they did use anti-Semitism as a defense.  And all these young Jewish engineers were exonerated, but their families and they lived through a terrible time.  Ms. Higgins:   It was a terrible time.   Ms. Eisenberg:    The blot on our history. And I remember when McCarthy died, I said to my father, “It's a good thing for the country that he's gone.”  Ms. Higgins:   I remember my father sent a letter to Dean Acheson who had said, “I will not turn my back on Alger Hiss.”  And I was afraid that people would come to the house and come for my father. And that was in the United States of America.  Ms. Eisenberg:    Yes, we feel so free, now.  Ms. Higgins:   Yes, we certainly do feel free, now.  I wanted to ask you how did you happen to become interested in the Long Branch Historical Association?  You're obviously active in it.  I do want one of those shirts of the presidents.  Ms. Eisenberg:    Home is Long Branch.  It's not my life.  I've lived in Ocean Township thirty years, and I love it here.   Ms. Higgins:   Yes, but Long Branch is home?  Ms. Eisenberg:    Long Branch is home.  And I'm not - I didn't get very far away.  I always go back to Long Branch.  We lived in Matawan for a very short time where my husband started an optometric practice.  And every weekend, where would we go?  Long Branch.  Visit the Pinskys, visit the Sacks family.   Ms. Higgins:   Long Branch has a nice library, too.  It's held on through thick and thin, and good times and bad because the people like their library and they use it.  Ms. Eisenberg:    One of your librarians I went to school with, and I think her name was Muriel Hamilton, I always knew her name, but now, I forgot, but I think it was Muriel.  And she showed me the Long Branch collection. I got some information there for my autobiography, that's how I know about Phil Daly's gambling house.  Ms. Higgins:   Let's talk about your autobiography.  Do you have a publisher?  Ms. Eisenberg:    I don't have a publisher.  I'm just starting to write it.  In fact, I've had trouble with my old Macintosh computer and so, this week or next, I'm going to buy a computer and really get serious with it.  But this is as much as I put on so far and the Table of Contents reads: Family Hotel, and I'm gonna tell a lot of the stories that I just told you now, Love and Marriage, the Single Scene, because I've been a widow for twenty-three years, but the last chapter is called Old Car, because the last time I saw my doctor she said, “So, how are you?”  And I said, “Like an old car, you replace one part, and then you need another part and then this is wrong and that’s wrong.” I've been very healthy up until now, but some things are beginning to fall apart a little.  And it's the style to write your memoirs for the grandchildren.  Everybody is either doing genealogy or writing their autobiography.  And I did start.  Like I said, the senior citizen's activities network at Monmouth Mall had a creative writing group and the object is to write your autobiography, and some of the people in my class have done that and brought bound copies to me, and they are very proud and they would like it to be a published book.  And that's far in the future. I'm just getting started with the writing.  I know it's difficult to become published, but I can think of a lot of words that I want to put into it, and I wanted to include the history of Long Branch in my life because it's so closely intertwined.  And I am going to start seriously on that book in about a week.  Ms. Higgins:   Why did you give a chapter to the single scene?  Ms. Eisenberg:    Oh, I’ve been a widow for twenty-three years.  Ms. Higgins:   Tell us about the single scene.  Ms. Eisenberg:    Well, oh, boy. I handled widowhood very well. My husband was sick for a long time.  He did have cancer  between 1970 and 1975, so I did have a lot of time.  And I decided that I shouldn't put in any more bad time, I should just go out and live my life.  My son's mother-in-law was a travel agent, and she put me on a cruise ship with a group called, Single World, so I had a group of single people to travel with. I did meet a man on that trip.  He was a bachelor from Philadelphia and I did go with him the first year and he kind of got me to get past all the bad times, all the anniversaries and the birthdays, the hardest - and the holidays, and the hardest things to handle in the beginning.  And then we broke off, partly because he lived in Philadelphia and I lived here and it wasn't easy to see each other.  I went to the singles' dances.  I found that sometimes single men, and women, can be very rude, they have dances called Lady's Choice and there were times when I'd go up and ask a man to dance and he would say no.  Or if you were with a man, a woman, even your best friend, wouldn't hesitate to come up and take him away from you. I had a lot of experiences like that. I just turned seventy two and I've kind of given up on it.  I never met anybody who was quite right.  Not that I was like a lot of other widows who said, oh, there isn't another man on the earth who could replace my husband.  I just wanted to meet somebody nice and thoughtful and who cared about me, and my needs and my desires.  And that never happened.  And at my age now, a lot of men are sick, and I'm not a nurse.  I like my freedom. I think that the best of all worlds is to date and have fun. And there are couples who do that and they're having a really good time.   Ms. Higgins:   And your children are local as well.  Ms. Eisenberg:    My children are all local, yes.  And so I'm just getting on with my life and I'm gonna sit with my computer and write my book.  Ms. Higgins:   You will enjoy it.  I can tell by the way you've spoken today you have a lot to give.  Ms. Eisenberg:    I do want to tell you that I have traveled around the world.  I've attended the Space Academy.   Ms. Higgins:   Really?  Ms. Eisenberg:    Which was five days of simulated astronaut training.  It was a program for teachers and students.  And I took my oldest grandson as his Bar Mitzvah present.  He was twelve and he went in with the children's group and I went in with the teachers' group, and we didn't see each other for five days.   Ms. Higgins:   Wow!  Ms. Eisenberg:    And I went through a lot of the equipment. And we flew two simulated missions.  I had dinner with Alan Shepard.  Ms. Higgins:   How wonderful!  Ms. Eisenberg:    And one of our instructors, or speakers, was Jim, Colonel Jim Irwin, who was the eighth man on the moon.  And the one you see saluting the flag in the picture taken on the moon.   Ms. Higgins:   That's a wonderful story.  Ms. Eisenberg:    I have been very adventuresome.  I've gone to the Mardi Gras in New Orleans.  And if there's some mischief to get into, I go looking for it.  Ms. Higgins:  Before we close, I definitely want to talk to you about your pen pals.   Ms. Eisenberg:   Oh!  Okay.  I have a thing in my entranceway I do want to mention. It is the poem by Robert Pinsky, which was written for my husband and my sister-in-law after they both died within a year of each other.  My sister-in-law had gone to school with Robert Pinsky and he had taken her to the prom, so the poem refers to a date that they had.  And it mentions her mother and the Scott Towers on the oceanfront, which my sister-in-law's father built.  He built all of Elberon Village and did a lot of building in that area.  So the poem is about Julian Eisenberg and Nan Marlin Sacks.  And, and what else?  Ms. Higgins:   The other letters in your life?  Ms. Eisenberg:    Oh, yes.  I wrote and sent a picture to Queen Elizabeth because I came across some official government photos from World War II.  And there was one of hers when she was a driver of a vehicle. And there's a picture of her in a jumpsuit with the hood up on her vehicle.  And she and I are very close to the same age. And so I wrote her a letter and sent her that photograph and told her that I had been to England as part of an ambassador program started by Jimmy Carter and that Amy Carter was part of our group. And also I sent her an article from the Asbury Park Press saying that Windsor Castle had been restored after the fire and that she and Prince Philip were celebrating their fiftieth wedding anniversary.  And she answered me, not in a form letter, but answering all of those points, and thanking me very much for my thoughtfulness.     Ms. Higgins:   That's lovely.  She's apparently a very fine woman.  Ms. Eisenberg:  So I hear.  And I  heard her crack jokes and I understand she has a very good sense of humor, which she doesn't show to the public.  I also have a letter from Abba Eban because when I went to Israel in 1969 I met a member of the Knesset who at that time was assistant mayor to Teddy Kolleck in Jerusalem.  And we became friends and pen pals.  And he gave me a private tour of the Knesset, which is their parliament.  And we passed the mailboxes and he said, “This first one, this mailbox belongs to Abba Eban, would you like to leave him a note?”  And I had the smallest pad with me and I wrote one sentence which was, “I'm proud of the way you stand up in the United Nations and fight for right and justice, despite world censure.”  And he asked me to put my name and address on the back of that little piece of paper.  And Abba Eban wrote me a letter saying thank you for that.  Ms. Higgins:   That's a very interesting story.  I see you've been all over the world.  Ms. Eisenberg:    Yes, I just want to add to that Israel trip, that the member of the Knesset is Rabbi Porush. My son was living in Israel at that time.  I was there to visit him and Rabbi Porush sent a man with a car for us.  He drove us to the Knesset, he got us past security, and we were invited into the private dining room.  The person at the next table was Moshe Dayan. Yes, and Begin did come into the room, and then we attended a session in the Knesset.   Ms. Higgins:       Speaking of politicians, I like to ask people of our age, where were you, what is your memory of the death of Franklin Roosevelt?  Ms. Eisenberg:    I don't remember the day so much as, they all say, you know where you were when John Kennedy died.  And I do know where I was.   Ms. Higgins:   What was that experience like?  Ms. Eisenberg:    I was substitute teaching in a the Dow Avenue school in Oakhurst.  And the announcement was made over the loudspeaker.  And one little girl started to cry and ran out of the room and I let her go. I thought she wanted to go into the girls' room and cry.  I let her go.  Ordinarily you don't let a child run out of your class.  I let her go.  And the other children just sat there.  And that's all I remember.  I don't remember what I said, or what anybody did in that classroom.   Ms. Higgins:   Often when I do these interviews, I say is there anything you would like to conclude the interview with and then there's something very fine said.  Then we turn off the tape and the best stories come.  Now, are you going to do that to me or are you going to put the best stories on the last few minutes of this interview?  Ms. Eisenberg:    I kind of feel like I've said a lot.  I just have this love for Long Branch.  I just feel like it's my life.  And by the way the name of my autobiography is Five Generations. And the way, it came about is that just one day, out of the blue, I said to myself,  “Just how long have we been here?”  And I began to count from my grandfather to my grandchildren. I get five generations. And we're all still in Monmouth County.  Ms. Higgins:   That's says that you've chosen well where to live.  And Monmouth County is lucky to have you, I'm sure.  Ms. Eisenberg:    Oh, I know that I am lucky to have Monmouth County and I have said to my children, I hope you realize how happy, how lucky you are to have been born here.  And I feel how lucky I am that my father hid under the hay in a wagon leaving Russia going over the border to Poland to board a ship at the Baltic Sea to come here so I could be born in Long Branch, New Jersey on the oceanfront.   Ms. Higgins:   Your father did a very brave thing.  I hope when you finish your memoirs, you will give the Monmouth County Library an opportunity to purchase it.  I hope you get a publisher, if you don't get a publisher, perhaps you will give it to the archives and make it available to future generations.  Ms. Eisenberg:    I'm so happy you said that because the whole time I'm going to be writing this I'll feel like there's a purpose.  I know it's very difficult to get published.  A lot of people think they're going to write a book and get published.  I know some of those people.  It's difficult.  I will try and I am honored that you would like a copy of it.  Ms. Higgins:       Wonderful stories.  I've enjoyed this interview very, very much. Thank you.  Ms. Eisenberg:    I've enjoyed it, also, and thank you.  
MonmouthCounty;Arthur Kamin;xxxx;2000;Arthur Kamin, xxxx, 2000        Remembering The 20th Century: An Oral History of Monmouth County      Art Kamin  Date of Interview: August 28, 2000  Name of Interviewer: Flora Higgins  Premises of Interview: Mr. Kamin's home, Fair Haven, NJ  Birthdate of Subject: N/A    Ms. Higgins: Good morning, Art. Thank you for having me over today to record your memories of Monmouth County in the twentieth century.    Mr. Kamin:  Happy to have you.    Ms. Higgins: First of all, please tell me how and when you came to Monmouth County.    Mr. Kamin:  Sure. I actually came to Monmouth in October of 1954. I had just recently graduated from Rutgers University where I was in the ROTC, which is the Reserve Officers Training Corps. At graduation the previous June, I was commissioned in the Signal Corps and I came to Fort Monmouth in October of 1954 to begin something called the Basic Officers Training Course at Fort Monmouth. And that's how we came here.    Ms. Higgins: Where did your people come from originally?    Mr. Kamin:  I was originally from South River, New Jersey, which is not far from New Brunswick. I was born there and have lived in New Jersey all my life.    Ms. Higgins: So Rutgers was a natural choice for you.    Mr. Kamin:  Yes. Rutgers had a good school of journalism and it was a place that my family and I could afford. So I went to Rutgers, enjoyed it, and lived on campus.    Ms. Higgins: You apparently always wanted to be a journalist, and followed that career. How did you do that, after being a soldier at Fort Monmouth?    Mr. Kamin:  Well, yes, I did always want to be a journalist. I wrote news and sports for our weekly newspaper in South River which was called the South River Spokesman. And then, as I said, I went to Rutgers and studied journalism and while there I was very, very active in The Targum, which is the school newspaper. Eventually, I became editor-in-chief of The Targum.    Ms. Higgins: Is it still The Targum?    Mr. Kamin:  It's now called The Daily Targum. Interestingly, when I left, we began the conversion of what was then a twice-a-week newspaper into a daily.    Ms. Higgins: That was not your only experience doing that, was it?    Mr. Kamin:  You are thinking of The Red Bank Register, which we also changed from a weekly into a daily newspaper.    Ms. Higgins: In interview after interview, people tell me how they waited Thursdays for The Register to come out so they would know where to shop and where to go to the movies.    Mr. Kamin:  I was part of that marvelous experience on the weekly Register and, when you're ready, I'll tell you a little bit about that, too.    Ms. Higgins: Please go back to when you had graduated and were working in Fort Monmouth.    Mr. Kamin:  So, I came to Fort Monmouth and finished the Basic Officer Course. Interestingly, I had orders for Hawaii after I finished the Basic Officer Course. But--this can only happen in the Army-- a new general came aboard at the Signal School at Fort Monmouth. The General's name was William Hamlin, and he decided that he wanted to make some changes in the Signal School. He decided that he wanted his own information officer. He looked through some of my records and found that I had a background in journalism and, much to my surprise and astonishment, the Department of the Army orders were changed so I stayed at Fort Monmouth. A little sidelight on that. Ginny, the former Ginny Palew, who I had been dating. We met at Rutgers. She was a student at Douglass. I had proposed marriage while I was in the Basic Officer Course, and we thought we'd spend a wonderful vacation in Hawaii while I was serving in the military. But, sure enough, the orders were changed. But, look, it didn't make any difference. We were at Fort Monmouth for two years. We had a wonderful time. The following January--in January of 1955--we were married. Anyway, both Ginny and I had the experience of being at Fort Monmouth for those two years, which we liked.    Ms. Higgins: Tell us about the troubles at Fort Monmouth with the hearings of the McCarthy era.    Mr. Kamin:  Actually, that had come a little before. In other words, by the time I got to Fort Monmouth, that trouble had pretty much subsided. But when I was the editor of Targum, at Rutgers and, while I was a student at Rutgers, that whole McCarthy era atmosphere prevailed there because Rutgers had three so called Fifth Amendment professors. They were three professors who decided that they did not want to answer the questions of a Congressional Committee. Much to our unhappiness at the Targum, the University dismissed them. So the Targum took a very, very strong stand in favor of the professors. We felt that they should not have been dismissed, and that there was an academic freedom issue involved. The University took its action. But we were vindicated in years to come because-- I think it might have been in the 1960s-- the three professors were reinstated at Rutgers.    Ms. Higgins: Do you remember their names?    Mr. Kamin:  Their names were Finley, Heimlich, and Abe Glasser. It might have been Moses Finley. I don't remember Heimlich's first name. There was another issue that we championed at Rutgers that I really am very proud of. I consider this issue to be one of the highlights of my journalistic career. We helped to eliminate fraternity discrimination at Rutgers. Those were the days, you may remember, when you had a Jewish fraternity, a Catholic fraternity. Minorities were not welcome in some houses. This was something that could never happen today. So The Targum-- as only The Targum could do-- managed to come up with the names of the fraternities that discriminated and had discriminatory clauses in their bylaws. We ran the names of the fraternities in an editorial and in a news story. Needless to say, the fraternity men were very, very unhappy. And, to make a long story short, that was really the start to eliminate fraternity discrimination at Rutgers, I'm happy to say.    Ms. Higgins: In the 1950s this was very avant garde, wasn't it?    Mr. Kamin:  No question.    Ms. Higgins: How did you come to work at The Register?    Mr. Kamin:  While I was at Fort Monmouth I started to moonlight at The Register. While I was there as a Signal Corps Information officer, I decided I wanted to get some more newspaper experience. The Register had an opening, so I applied and was hired. I would go out in those days, even while I was in the Army, and cover meetings for The Register: Rumson Council, Fair Haven Council, and some boards of education. And then, of course, I was lucky when I was discharged in October of 1956, that The Register had a permanent job vacancy. I was hired as a fulltime reporter at that particular time. I think my salary was ninety-six dollars a week and, occasionally, a little bit of overtime, which was at the discretion of the editor at that time--for maybe covering an extra meeting. Listen, that was really "big money" in those days so we managed. Ginny was a teacher then -- and still is, in Fair Haven.    Ms. Higgins: Was that called a stringer?    Mr. Kamin:  That was the first job, yes. A stringer is a person who is not on staff and a person who is usually paid by meetings. So that's when I began my career at The Register.    Ms. Higgins: Who was the editor there then and why did The Register appeal to you?      The Register newsroom on Broad Street, Red Bank  Mr. Kamin:  The Register editor was a guy by the name Jim Hogan. You've probably heard that name before: James J. Hogan. A very, very good editor. He knew the county. He knew Red Bank. He was a stickler for accuracy and objectivity. He wanted all the facts in a news story. The Register, at that time, was said to have the largest circulation of any weekly in the country. We had about eighteen thousand circulation. And we'd print as many as eighty pages which was really very, very big. And I liked the fact that there was a great deal of integrity at The Register. It served the community well. At the same time, both Ginny and I liked living in Monmouth County. We thought it would be a place where I would get a few years of experience and then, perhaps, I could go on to a larger paper. But as you know, I stayed here my entire career.     Ms. Higgins: Can you think of any causes you championed as president and editor of The Register?    Ms. Kamin: One accomplishment at The Register that comes to mind immediately is the expansion of the Monmouth County Library system. It was The Register that championed, and championed very, very strongly the new facility in Shrewsbury. There was some hesitation, I think, on the Board of Freeholders at that time, as to whether or not they should go ahead with it. We took a very, very strong stand and emphasized how we think it would bring great benefits to the county. And, sure enough, the library expansion became a reality. Back in the 1960s, it was The Register that also saw the need for a community college and championed that cause through news stories and through editorials. The Freeholder Director of Monmouth County at that time was Joseph C. Irwin, -- a very, very dedicated Freeholder Director. He and the other Freeholders had selected the first Board of Trustees for the college. We thought it was a very political board. We were unhappy with it. We thought that the board was not, in all due respect to the members-- the board to lead the college at the critical outset of the college. So The Register, in a responsible way, selected, for the Board of Freeholders, a list of county residents we thought would make an outstanding board.    Ms. Higgins: Who were some of them?    Mr. Kamin:  I do not remember all of them. But one was Jim Greene, who is a banker and who lives in Fair Haven. He was also a trustee of Hamiliton College at that time. That is an example of the caliber of individuals we proposed. There were several others. Their names will come to me. We said we thought they would really make for the best board at that time. And, to our happiness, Joe Irwin agreed that many of these people should be on the board. The library and the community college--two important institutions in the county. They raised the quality of life in our region.    Ms. Higgins: Monmouth County has been so consistently Republican that perhaps many of these boards were a little political.    Mr. Kamin:  Yes.    Ms. Higgins: Did The Register have any feedback from that?    Mr. Kamin:  I think what you're asking is, were we an independent paper?    Ms. Higgins: Yes.    Mr. Kamin:  Yes, we certainly were. We, in supporting candidates--not only Freeholders but also at the state level, exercised great independence and care. The Register was independent and we would support candidates of both parties. We always tried to endorse the best people. Yes, that was one of the strong points of the paper. And I think politicians probably respected us for it, or did not like it, perhaps. But when it came to an election or another issue, we supported who we thought were the best candidates - both Democrats and Republicans.    Ms. Higgins: Monmouth County is obviously well run, having been voted the third most desirable place to live, but do you think it might have been even better had there been a more energetic two party system?    Mr. Kamin:  That is a very, very good question, Flora, and the answer to that is yes. I think that a good system of checks and balances is important at the county level, the local level, or the state level. Very often I think there is a complacency that sort of creeps in when you have the one-party system. I think that for the good of all citizens and for the good of taxpayers, it's really, in my opinion, much better to have both parties represented. But, in the absence of that, I think a good free and vigorous and independent newspaper, or newspapers, can play an important watchdog role over the government.    Ms. Higgins: You said newspapers  did you have any competition at The Register? Does the Asbury Park Press have any competition now?    Mr. Kamin:  Well, at the time--and this is what I think fired us up so at The Register, and this is what made the newspaper, in all modesty, as good and as aggressive as it was-- was the fact that it was a very competitive time for the press in Monmouth County. We also had very thorough coverage of everything that went on in the northern and western areas of the county. We were the newspaper of record. The Bible. You always learned new and different things by reading The Register. At the time I joined the paper, the Long Branch Record was still in existence as a daily newspaper and the Asbury Park Press, of course, The Register became a daily in 1959. And, in the northern fringes of the county in places like Matawan and Aberdeen and Keyport, we were competing against what at that time was the Perth Amboy Evening News and a host of weekly newspapers as well. So it was good competition. We always had a great desire among reporters and editors to get the story first and to beat the competition. That atmosphere and that culture, I think, benefits the readers. With all due respect to the Asbury Park Press-- which I think is a good newspaper-- I think they've lost that fire in their belly a little bit, so to speak. They don't have the competition they once did in the county. Of course, they think of themselves now as something of a regional, and even statewide, newspaper. They are part of The Gannet Organization. So now they look upon the Star Ledger as their big competitor. But, in my time at The Register, we not only competed against them but also the Newark News, as well as The Star Ledger, and the dailies and weeklies in Monmouth County. And it was a good time for journalism. Really.    Ms. Higgins: What do you see as the future of print media in Monmouth County?    Mr. Kamin:  I think it will be healthy. The Press will continue to grow. What was the Perth Amboy Evening News is now the Home News Tribune. It will grow. There are a number of weeklies that have sprung up: the Two River Times, the Atlanticville, the Hub in Red Bank, an excellent weekly in Manasquan and others. They try to give some local coverage as best as they can. Business is tough. But they are succeeding. I think the future looks okay.    Ms. Higgins: How do you stand on the developments in Red Bank? There's been a lot of conversation about the riverfront development. Would you care to comment on that?    Mr. Kamin:  Sure. I think that Red Bank is a vibrant community today and it has a history of being a vibrant community. Red Bank has been blessed by location  it's a place where people have to go in and out of. It has the hospital. It has law offices. The town continues to grow and, in some respects, is being reinvented. It's a new population and there's a whole new set of business dynamics. Some concerns have been raised about the so-called River Center, its role in the municipality, and whether it is a quasi-governmental agency or not. Is all of its business being done in the public interest? Does the public have a say in what it does? I don't think the public has really had a first hand knowledge of everything that is going on there. Still, I would say, by and large, what has been going on in Red Bank looks okay. But, here again, I think it needs a closer look to make certain that everything really is the way it should be. That is very often the danger of so-called "quasi-governmental" groups.     Ms. Higgins: People complain to me about the gentrification of Red Bank, and say that it's impossible to rent an apartment there for an average person, or have a business  and a friend of mine on the West Side is beginning to feel crowded. When you were editor of The Register did you notice any particular friction between Red Bank and the Red Bank West Side?      Art Kamin (far right) with his wife, Ginny, Daniel O'Hern, and Mr. O'Hern's wife  Mr. Kamin:  There, indeed, are frictions.  I'm sorry to say, they have always existed. The Register tried, as best as it could, to bring the two sides of Red Bank together. When I was president and editor of The Register in the 1960s, we had the so called riots. While Red  Bank was not touched as deeply as Asbury Park was, or Newark, there was no question, many frictions were there. Red Bank was fortunate in that Daniel O'Hern was the mayor at that particular time. There were people like Bette Thompson, Stafford Thompson, in the Black community, and the name of Linus McKean of Rumson comes to mind-- people who were really vital forces in setting people to talk and bringing all sides together to help calm a difficult situation. So there's no question that frictions and the problems have always been there. But at least at that particular time, there were people who were talking to one another and trying to bring peace. But, yes, I think some of these social and educational and economic housing problems continue to exist. Gentrification is a concern. But I think there appears to be an effort to make sure that there is some housing for people who cannot afford some of the prices there. That always has to be looked at.    Ms. Higgins: I want to ask you to comment on the current demise in Asbury Park. And also on the advancement of the Bayshore area?     Mr. Kamin:  Oh, sure. Let me talk about the Bayshore first because an interesting thing happened in my career after I left The Register in 1989. I was asked by Governor Kean and Len Coleman, the state community affairs commissioner, to serve as the director of something called The Bayshore Development Office. It was sort of a partnership between the County and the State and the municipalities to bring about the orderly growth and development of the Bayshore. It was not a job I was looking for at that particular time. We had no idea which way it would go -- whether there should be development there, or whether the emphasis should be on environmental. So I have had a little bit of a hand in the Bayshore and its growth. And I think one of the reasons I was selected is because the governor at that time knew I was familiar with the entire region, having covered it as a reporter and having been involved as an editor. And let me also say this for the record: when I did get that job-- it was a state position--I am an independent and I never made contributions to political parties. So I am proud that I was able to be selected for that position without, in any way, making contributions or being connected to one particular party. And that's what they wanted. Someone independent and not beholden to anyone. I think one of the first things we did was to acquire the old right-of-way - the old railroad right-of-way that went all along the Bayshore. And that has now become the Henry Hudson Trail. I think that was one of our chief accomplishments. There was also, at that particular time, a Bayshore Plan 1 that called for a great deal of housing to be built in the Port Monmouth - Belford area as well as in Keansburg. And, I think, the plan called for the demolition of the old Keansburg amusement area. We explored that. And, as time went on, the amusement park stayed. Thank goodness. I'm glad it stayed, because the place had a character of its own. Actually one of the things that I have taken a position on--very, very strongly--is that I am opposed to the so-called Belford ferry terminal. At one time, it had some possibilities. But an interesting thing happened in the Bayshore in recent years. Highlands and Atlantic Highlands have started to rejuvenate. Their downtowns have started to come back. Ferry services have started there. And the ferries are really serving a very, very good purpose. Now, the need is no longer there in Belford. Private market forces -- without handouts and without subsidies -- are at work. Atlantic Highlands and Highlands ferry services are thriving and expanding. Belford, as a terminal site, is history.    Ms. Higgins: Did Monmouth County sponsor that program?     Mr. Kamin:  Yes, the Freeholders have spent millions of dollars to push the Belford ferry project  the main purpose is to bring about development in that area. And, once again, while I say that at one time it might have had some possibilities, today it doesn't, in my opinion. As I said, there is good ferry service in Atlantic Highlands. There is good ferry service in Highlands. Keyport, I'm happy to say, is starting a ferry service. And, I think before too long, there will be a ferry again in Keansburg. And I'm not alone in my opinion. The Belford Citizens Association, as well as the Bayshore commercial fishermen, have said they don't think a ferry is a good idea at Belford. So it's been good to see the Bayshore coming back. It is a very, very unique area. I love it. And we're talking now about places like Aberdeen, Matawan, Keyport, Union Beach, Hazlet, parts of Middletown, Leonardo, Belford, Port Monmouth, North Middletown, and, of course, Atlantic Highlands and Highlands. So it's good to see some of the things that are happening there. I think there has to be great caution in that there can be a tendency there to perhaps make it, or parts of it, into another Hudson River - Jersey City - Hoboken type of waterfront. And while I'm certainly not against that type of development, I think the Bayshore has a unique character unto itself and it just does not call for having all that development there. The emphasis should be on the environment and the recreational, as well as bringing back the downtown business areas. I have written on that subject, too. It's been a little bit controversial. But I have written on it and have tried to get my views across. Now, on to Asbury Park. I think Asbury Park's decline is due, in the long measure, to neglect on the part of government  on the part of citizens there, and on the part of a general economic conditions. I don't think it should have happened. The Freeholders are now realizing that they should have had a more active role in Asbury Park. They are trying now to make some effort to perhaps get some recreation there and to help out in some economic areas. But look, what goes down eventually will come back up. I believe there are some local forces now in Asbury Park that are starting to move forward in changing things around. There's an effort by the state to be involved in redevelopment there. And I really haven't made up my mind -- to be frank -- as to whether that is really the best thing for Asbury Park. Sometimes the state can be a positive force. Other times, unfortunately, politics will get involved and it could affect Asbury Park's comeback. But I think the city will be heading back. I also think, in some respects, it probably will follow Long Branch, which is also making some good, dramatic changes again.    Ms. Higgins: We haven't talked much about the western part of the county  transportation continues to plague Monmouth County as we development so rapidly. When's the last time you were in Freehold?    Mr. Kamin:  Last week.    Ms. Higgins: Isn't it becoming such a charming place?    Mr. Kamin:  Yes, Freehold is. No question.    Ms. Higgins: But I hear over and over again from people that they actually made it quicker from Red Bank to Freehold in the horse and buggies. There weren't all the red lights and traffic. Other interviewees mentioned the relative ease with which they moved around the County with the trolley and the trains. We're very dependent on cars.    Mr. Kamin:  I'm on a State Supreme Court Advisory Committee in Trenton, and I attend meetings there once a month. It's a pro bono thing. I go through Freehold and, frankly, my eyebrows are raised and I shed a tear as I see all that development going on on the corridor to Freehold. The big issue in the west is whether or not there should be the so called MOM, the railroad project that would link Middlesex, Ocean, and Monmouth counties. They're looking to use the old railroad right of way, I believe, to bring train service that would go through the Western area of Monmouth County. I'm not sure that's the best plan. There's been a lot of opposition to that particular project. Places like Jamesburg and South Brunswick don't want a rail line there. But the western part of Monmouth County is growing, especially in places like Manalapan, Marlboro, and Howell. I wish that some of that growth could be curtailed. No question, suburban sprawl, as it's been labeled, has hit Monmouth County, and I think we're all suffering. We just can't handle all that growth, no matter what the Freeholders say.    Ms. Higgins: What do you see as the significant changes in Monmouth County?    Mr. Kamin:  Schools have improved dramatically. The coming of Brookdale has meant a great deal to the county. It's been good to see the diversity that has come in to Monmouth. One of the reasons that Ginny and I moved to Fair Haven back in 1957 is because the schools were good in both the elementary district and at Rumson-Fair Haven Regional High School. We thought that would be a nice place for our kids to grow and flourish. Also, Fair Haven has always been a diverse community, as you know. There's been a minority population here. That goes back many years. And we're happy that we and our kids have been a part of that. Living in Fair Haven has been - and is - a nice and extraordinary experience. It delights us how our kids tell us now how they enjoyed growing up here.     Ms. Higgins: Your children have done very well. Did they go to public schools until they went to college?    Mr. Kamin:  That's nice of you to say. We're very proud of them. Our children went to public schools in Fair Haven and also Rumson Fair Haven Regional High School.    Ms. Higgins: And then on to -    Mr. Kamin:  Our son went on to Amherst College in Massachusetts and our daughter started at Vassar and then liked Amherst so much that she transferred to Amherst College after taking part in an exchange program there. They both went on to graduate schools -- Brooke at Rutgers, and Blair at Yale.     Ms. Higgins: What do you see as the future of Monmouth County? Give some predictions for people reading or listening to this interview fifty or one hundred years from now.    Mr. Kamin:  Just be a little more specific.    Ms. Higgins: All right, do you think high rises will take over the waterfront?     Mr. Kamin:  Those dangers are there. And they are lurking at every single moment as developers want to build more - both high rises and housing developments, strip malls and shopping centers. But I think we've been alerted to that. And I think efforts are now being made for greater preservation-- farmland, and open space. But we're getting crowded. There's no question about that. I know that the Freeholders like to pride themselves on that Money magazine story of several years ago that cited Monmouth County as the third best place to live in the country. And I agree that it certainly is a great place to live. But, by the same token, we have to be ever vigilant in order to make certain that Monmouth County stays a great place without over-development taking place. Also, it is important that we have population diversity. We should break down housing bias barriers in Monmouth County. I think that would be a great achievement if we can do all that.    Ms. Higgins: Whoever voted for that third place was not out on Route 9 at rush hour.    Mr. Kamin:  Good point.    Ms. Higgins: Let's talk a little about culture in Monmouth County. How do you see the development of culture in Monmouth County in the twentieth century?    Mr. Kamin:  This has been astounding. Ginny and I remember when a big cultural night out meant going to see the Monmouth Players. Remember them in Navesink? That was culture at its best in Monmouth County. And we always enjoyed their marvelous plays.    Ms. Higgins: Did you attend the theater in Tinton Falls, where the Grist Mill is now?    Mr. Kamin:  Yes. Geza DeVegh had a little art gallery there, too. Anyhow, that was culture in those days. So was the theater series at the Carlton in Red Bank. But yet, it's developed beautifully with all the theatrical groups and the musical groups  and the library has just been absolutely extraordinary in many, many ways. And Monmouth University, in its way, does a great job in adding to the cultural aspect of the county. I think there's been tremendous improvements in that area.    Ms. Higgins: As a last question, what advice would you give to future generations? You've already stated that we should guard against overzealous development. But is there any other kind of advice you'd like leave with us?    Mr. Kamin:  In that context, I want to go back to the newspaper aspect. At The Register, we started out as a weekly. We became a daily. We became a Sunday. And I think we were, in many respects, ever-vigilant, so to speak, which is the role a newspaper should play in municipal government and county government and state government. We were watchdogs in the public interest. I sometimes have a concern that that same vigilance is not being applied as it once was. In some respects, we served as the conscience of the community. We talked a little about the competitive aspect of newspapers and what that meant to different communities and citizens in our county. And I believe that office holders had a certain concern that what they did would get the exposure of good reporting and editorials. Now you don't see as much of that. I'm happy that a paper such as the Asbury Park Press, and of course some of the weekly papers, are continuing that vigilance--and that the best interests of the public are served in all respects. Let me also say that citizens have an obligation and a responsibility to keep an eye  on government at all times.    Ms. Higgins:  Everybody who has been in the county a long time remembers The Register as being once a week, and then suddenly it was there everyday, and you shepherded that change. Would you tell us about that?      Art Kamin (left) editor of The Register  Eleanor Marko, women's page editor  Harold Kelly, publisher of The Register.  Mr. Kamin:  Sure. This, once again, is an example of the growth of the county. The  parkway was constructed. The Monmouth Mall in Eatontown was going to be built. We saw, at that particular time, that the county as we knew it was changing. The weekly Register also was starting to change. And we knew that if we did not go ahead and begin a daily operation, that somebody else would do it. So that was when we made our change in 1959 from being a weekly newspaper to a daily. It was an enormous risk. Harold Kelly was the publisher at that time. I was the editor. We did not know how it would go. Would the advertising and the readers be there? And, sure enough, we lost about half of our readership--only because people did not want a daily newspaper. They were unsure of it. It was a change. Eventually, we began winning back our readers and, at the time that I left The Register in 1989, our circulation was about thirty five, thirty six, thirty seven thousand, somewhere in that area. So it was a difficult time. But, with a good staff and acceptance by the public, we managed to keep it going. It was quite an undertaking, but we succeeded.    Ms. Higgins: Well it certainly was an institution during most of the twentieth century. I really appreciate this opportunity to talk to you.    Mr. Kamin:  Wonderful to chat with you.  
MonmouthCounty;Anne M. Stommel;1923;2000;Anne M. Stommel, 1923, 2000        Remembering The 20th Century: An Oral History of Monmouth County      Anne Stommel, 1997  Date of Interview: April 10, 2000  Name of Interviewer: June West  Premises of Interview: Ms. Stommel's home, Red Bank, NJ  Birthdate of Subject: August 5, 1923  Deceased: October 30, 2003    Ms. Stommel: I am Anne Melson Stommel and I was born in Wilmington, Delaware on the fifth of August, 1923. I lived there for two years and then we moved to Brooklyn, New York. I never knew my father  he was in Sweden, and my mother had to support us, and we moved, as I say to Brooklyn, and I went to public schools there. Then we moved to Freeport, Long Island because my mother wanted better schools for my brother. I went from seventh grade to the ninth grade in Freeport, Long Island, and then we moved down here to Monmouth County. My mother was a public relations director, at what was then Monmouth Memorial Hospital and is now Monmouth Medical Center.    Ms. West: What year was it that you moved to Monmouth County?    Ms. Stommel: 1938. My mother had commuted for two years down here because my brother had said that he wouldn't study if she moved him away from his friends. So when he graduated from Freeport High School, we moved here  we moved over to Leonardo, which is on the shore by Atlantic Highlands.    Ms. West: How old were you when you moved here?    Ms. Stommel: I was fifteen. I had one year of Middletown High School, which was then called Leonardo High School, and then we moved to Rumson. In 1938 I went to Rumson High, and I had two years of Rumson High and graduated from there in 1941. There was a benefactor in Monmouth County, Mr. Bertram H. Borden, who was the president of Monmouth Memorial Hospital, and he also built the Rumson High School. He was very interested in children, and he knew my mother from the hospital. He was interested in me because I studied hard  I was told I had to get a scholarship or I couldn't get to college, so I had to study hard. Well, I did study, and I was the Valedictorian at Rumson High. The students voted for Valedictorian, so they voted for a football player as Valedictorian, butI actually was Valedictorian. I had applied to Vassar College and I had to take college entrance exams. I was the first pupil from Rumson High who ever took College Board entrance exams. I passed, and Mr. Borden had established a scholarship at Rumson High of two thousand dollars, which was a lot of money in 1941. I shudder when I think that college is now twenty-five thousand dollars. So it was a single scholarship and the student was supposed to be there for four years. But he gave an additional scholarship in honor of his wife, because he said, "Look what Anne is doing for our school." I never thought of the school as being new, but it was just built in 1936, so when I went in 1939, it was a very new school.    Ms. West: He built it in honor of his wife  what was his wife's name?    Ms. Stommel: The scholarship was in honor of his wife. Her name was Mary Owen Borden. So then I went off to college, and my mother married my stepfather when I was nineteen. I lived in White Plains, New York. My stepfather died in 1947 and we came back here. My mother was always very interested in history and in Monmouth County, and I can recall having to go over to Old Tennent Church in Freehold and being told about the Battle of Monmouth. I also have Delaware and Maryland ancestors, and I'm a member of the DAR  my mother made me be. The Revolutionary War ancestor that I got in on was Scarborough Parker, who was an ensign in the Snow Hill Battalion in Maryland. My reason for mentioning that is that our troops were retreating at the Battle of Monmouth and General George Washington came on the field and he said, "They must be stayed until I can form the main army," which was miles away coming from Princeton. And Major Ramsey of the Maryland Regiment said, "They shall be stayed." And Major Ramsey and the Maryland Regiment held the British off until Washington could come on the field. And I don't know, but I like to think that Scarborough Parker of the Snow Hill Battalion in Maryland was there, who stayed the British. Another very interesting thing, I don't want to say too much about the history, but there's a monument at Tennent Church to the soldiers who fought in the Revolutionary War there at Monmouth Battlefield. And it was donated by Tennent Chapter DAR. I think it is down around Spring Lake. I forget the name of the monument company, but it's there on Wall Street and Locust Avenue in Long Branch. And he, an Italian immigrant, said he never charged for that, and there are hundreds of names on it, and he said it was one thing he could do for our country. So all the names of the Monmouth County residents who fought in the Revolutionary War are on that monument, and a man in Long Branch carved the names. I guess that's enough about both Tennent Church and Freehold. One thing that's interesting in that cemetery: there's a tombstone for a Colonel Moncton near Old Tennent Church and a Britisher gave that monument because he knew that Colonel Moncton had been killed and buried there, and Moncton was his ancestor. And also his father had been killed in World War I and is in an unknown grave. There are all kinds of historical things in Monmouth County. We joined the Monmouth County Historical Society  oh, this was back in the 1950s, early 1960s, I guess. And that society was going to have a little fife and drum corps  I think it was called The Joshua Huddy Fife and Drum Corps. They were teaching the children. They got fifes for the children, they could afford that. But they were teaching the boys with drumsticks by tapping them on the back of a chair. They had to get the trap drums, and they had to get a bass drum. And this isn't to brag or anything, and I didn't really have much money, I just had my salary from Fort Monmouth, but the lady in charge said a bass drum was a thousand dollars. So I looked at mother, and she looked at me, and I said, "I'll pledge a thousand dollars for the bass drum." So the bass drum in the little fife and drum corps out there in Freehold has a plaque that is in memory of my Melson ancestors. That's my middle name and my mother's maiden name.    Ms. West: What year was this?    Ms. Stommel: I think it was probably in the late 1950s or early 1960s. Well, now, I graduated from Rumson High School, as I said, and in 1947 we came back here. And we lived on the Rumson Road and Hance Road, it's actually Little Silver, just on the border of Little Silver. And we lived there for two or three years, and my favorite view had always been crossing the Locust Bridge, the Oceanic Bridge that goes from Rumson over to Locust, going down to Navesink River Road and coming into Red Bank. And we drove there one night and we saw that the corner property was for sale, just across the bridge. That had been our favorite spot, so my mother spoke to our contractor and said, "How soon can you build me a new house?" And he said, "What's wrong with the one you've got?" And she said, "I sold it yesterday." So we bought that corner and we lived there for thirty-three years.   Before I went to Fort Monmouth, I had apprenticed at a foundation in New York City, so I knew about commuting from the Red Bank Station to New York. I learned about all aspects of motion pictures and still pictures and editing and photography and so forth. I had pneumonia in 1948, and so I had to stop commuting. All I knew except films was very punk typing, and I could picture myself as a typist/receptionist as Wyckoff's Grain and Feed Store, which is on Maple Avenue and Bergen Place in Red Bank. But the training started over at Fort Monmouth before the Korean War, and what I had done in New York fit in hand-in-glove with what they wanted at the Fort. So I got the job as a Visual Presentation Information Specialist and made filmstrips, which are sort of like a slide lecture but on a continuous piece of film, for the trainees. And then I went into literature. I prepared training manuals, field manuals, not the technical manuals which are on how equipment operates, but the field manuals on how that equipment is used in the field. And in 1961 there was a job advertised as a Motion Picture Scenario Writer over at the laboratories. I applied for it, and I got it. And to me it was the most marvelous perfect job that I ever could have had, if I had dreamed up the perfect one. Fort Monmouth started out as the Signal Corps back in 1917, and people thought of it as cross-flags and pigeons. But during World War II, the people who lived here in the county made Fort Monmouth in Monmouth County in Little Silver so important because they made communications equipment for the army, navy, air force, and marines. They made telephones, teletypes, radios, radar, and in the laboratory, when I was there, they had communications for the space satellite. They started a Courier Communication Satellite. And I remember so much going around the parking lot at the Acme store on River Road in Fair Haven, and the radio was on. I was waiting for my mother, and I heard, "This is the President of the United States speaking to you from outer space by the miracles of scientific research and development." And it was President Eisenhower's voice, and the tape recording that had his voice on it had been prepared at Fort Monmouth for the satellite that was going around and around for a year in space.    Ms. West: What year, do you recall?    Ms. Stommel: Around 1957, I guess. I was so fantastically interested in the space age, and of course, I never was in Florida, and never saw the rockets go up, but I belonged to an organization, the Armed Forces Communications and Electronic Association, and it still exists. I'm an honorary life member  I was made that in 1974. But we had lecture programs, and one time Doctor Wernher von Braun spoke, in April 1953. One of the scientists at Fort Monmouth knew about Doctor Wernher von Braun down in Huntsville, Alabama, and von Braun came and he talked about space travel. The rocket would go up a hundred miles in space. It would be traveling eighteen thousand miles an hour. It would make a trip around the world every two hours, and of course, the Earth was revolving underneath that orbit so that it would cover a different space on Earth every two hours. I was on the Moonwatch team at Fort Monmouth. And the Moonwatch team spotted, by the human eye, the satellites that were up in space before our radar could detect them. And we were on the roof of the Hexagon Laboratory building, which is over in Tinton Falls. It's there now in the year 2000. I don't know whether it will be there when you're listening to things in this tape. But we had, up on the roof, almost like a picnic bench, a two-by-four suspended by seats on both sides, wooden seats on both sides, and on each two-by-four were telescopes, angled so that they would cover different portions of the sky. And we had a radio from WWB in Washington, D.C. that would give the time signals. "At the return of the signal it will be exactly 4:51am da da da da da!" There were six people, three on each side of the two-by-four. They'd sit on the bench and they'd look in the telescopes, and if one saw a satellite coming into the telescope, he or she would say, "Coming into the scope now, reaching the center now, leaving the scope now." The time signals were recorded from WWB at the Naval Observatory in Washington. They'd hear our voice saying, "Now." They knew where the telescopes were pointed and we'd send that information to the Smithsonian Institution. So that the Moonwatchers made a big contribution toward establishing the orbits of space satellites. The laboratory made materials, and they developed crystals, artificial crystals, to specific frequencies for the radios. Down at Evans Signal Laboratory in Neptune, they have the big antenna, Diana, that sent the first signals to the Moon. And the man, this is an interesting thing, the man who developed that, Dr. Harold Zahl, was the chief of research at the laboratories at Fort Monmouth, and his widow lives here in Navesink House where I live. I went with her last night to the Holmdel Historical Society. Now I sort of wore two hats, because in addition to doing that at Fort Monmouth, which I considered National Defense, which is the most important thing that we can be interested in, I was also a DAR member    Ms. West: For the records, for those who may not know, would you say what the DAR is?    Ms. Stommel: DAR stands for the Daughters of the American Revolution. And to be a member of the Daughters of the American Revolution, you have to be the direct descendant of a Revolutionary War soldier. You have to document that. But he didn't actually have to be a soldier, he could be somebody who made a contribution, who gave some horses, or barrels of flour, or were nurses.    Ms. West: Someone who could have contributed to the War.    Ms. Stommel: Somebody who contributed to our Revolutionary War effort. And I don't know if this is important, but I am from Monmouth County, and I learned this from a man who was at my office at Fort Monmouth, who was a direct ascendant of John Marshall, who was our first Supreme Court Justice. And he said that our Revolutionary War was not like other revolutions, where they're trying to overthrow a system of government. Ours was to preserve a system of government that we had formed in this country for one hundred and fifty years, and that the British were trying to take away from us. And they tried very hard to take it away from us. I won't go into all the sacrifices and so forth that our patriots went through. I joined the Shrewsbury Town Chapter, which is in Shrewsbury, at the Patriotic Four Corners. Of course that church, the Episcopal Church, on Broad Street and Sycamore Avenue, has a weather vane on top with a brass or a gold ball on top of that, and that's a replacement. The original ball is in a vacuum air-controlled case in the church because the rebel soldiers tried to shoot the ball off the top of the church, and the bullet holes are in the ball, and over the years, the weather and everything, deteriorated it so that the ball sank down and the people in the Shrewsbury Historical Society thought they should have a replica of it at the top of the steeple. And the original ball is in this vacuum, air-controlled cabinet. I think I contributed to the cabinet or something to help preserve it. Because the most important thing is to preserve our country and our history. No matter how many failings there can be, how many things can be wrong, it's better than any place else on earth. At least I believe that DAR members recite The Americans Creed, at every meeting, at our chapter meetings, and at our state meetings and our national meetings. And some people remember having said the Americans Creed at school. I never learned the American's Creed at school, but I had to memorize it because I was the Regent of our chapter. I'll recite it now if I can, because it's something that we say here in Monmouth County, and we know it's important: "I believe in the United States of America as a government of the people, by the people, for the people whose just powers are derived from the consent of the governed. A democracy in a republic: A sovereign nation of many sovereign states: A perfect union established upon those principals of freedom, equality, justice, and humanity for which American patriots sacrificed their lives and fortunes. I therefore believe it is my duty to my country to love it, to support its Constitution, to obey its laws, to respect its flag, and to defend it against all enemies." Now that last part 'defending it against all enemies' means domestic enemies as well as foreign enemies. And I'm very conservative  some people would probably call me straight-laced and reactionary, but I don't mind saying that I'm conservative and I believe that the United States is the most important thing in the world.   I told you previously about a Doctor Rullman, Dr. Walter Rullman, who founded Riverview Hospital back around the thirties... and old Doctor Field. Doctor Rullman was the chief surgeon at Riverview Hospital which then became Riverview Medical Center. I don't know what it's called now, and I don't know what it will be called by the time people listen to this tape. The Rullmans lived on Front Street, 58 West Front Street, across from Trinity Church. In the 1990s, Tracy Challenger was hired as the executive director of Rivercenter, and she was supposed to rejuvenate Red Bank and get the stores to be more productive. All the storeowners and the doctors, I think Doctor Blades, who is an eye doctor, contributed to make Red Bank viable again. Several of the towns in Monmouth County had fallen into disrepair. They were going to build Red Bank up. But I went to a supper last night at Basil T's, which is just at the foot of the new bridge in Red Bank, and there was a tri-city newspaper, weekly, that of course is free, and had a big article on Tracy Challenger, and it had her dream of Red Bank. Well I never cared about her dream of Red Bank  it should be the residents of Red Bank, what their dream is. So one of the things they did was to have Riverside Park, across from Trinity Church, down toward the river. To me, and now, it is just covered with cement. They might as well be on Shrewsbury Avenue  no trees, just cement cover  I don't know what it's going to be made into. But they had to knock down the Rullman's house to do this, and we had an organization, which we called Preservation Red Bank. I joined Preservation Red Bank in the late 1990s and one of the things we wanted to do was to save the Rullman house. It was a century home  it was of historic importance. It never got on the New Jersey Historic Sites List, but it was a project. The mayor and council thought that it would be too expensive to restore the house, so they just bulldozed it down, but it was a historic site, really, to people in Red Bank. It was a Federal period home. I'm not sure, but I think the Federal period was around 1810  it wasn't pre-colonial, before the Revolutionary War, but it was from about 1810, so it must have been a hundred and eighty or a hundred and ninety years old, and one of the last examples of that kind of architecture and that kind of a home. But the "progressive" people in Red Bank didn't give a hoot about it  it didn't fit the dream of this town planner. Now, let me think. I'll tell about some of the things about how simply wonderful those people were during World War II, which was from 1941 to 1945. Mrs. Rullman sent subscriptions of the Red Bank Register to the young fellows who had been their son's playmates who were drafted and were overseas in the military, and that was their way of keeping in touch with Red Bank.    Ms. West: What locations in Monmouth County have personal significance for you, and why?    Ms. Stommel: Well, not to me, but to a lot of people, the shore and the beach from Sandy Hook down to Point Pleasant are very significant. But to me it's the Navesink River, which is the North Shrewsbury  at one time it was called the Shrewsbury River. But there is a Shrewsbury River south of here. But the Navesink River from Red Bank over to Sea Bright has the most significance to me. I live at Navesink House, which is a retirement place in Red Bank, and four miles east is the Oceanic Bridge. Rumson used to be the Town Oceanic, and we still call the bridge the Oceanic Bridge. I lived on the north side of that bridge in Locust. When I was fifteen and sixteen I sort of christened every pair of sneakers I ever had in the river. I would go crabbing, and I would wade with the sneakers and the crab net. Of course you could go crabbing from a boat, but I didn't have a boat  I didn't have a rowboat so I waded. And you couldn't catch crabs if you saw the crab with its eyes, which would be the front of it  you couldn't put the net at the front of the crab to catch it because the crabs went sideways. I learned how to crab, and I had a lot of fun with that. I used to know people who had sailboats in Red Bank and I was a member of a crew at one time. A girl in Red Bank phoned me. She was very popular and she had a sailboat. She asked if I would crew for her. I thought, "Oh, how terrific, I can crew for Barbara!" So I came to Red Bank, we got in her boat that she had made during the winter, and she said, "There's only one thing you have to do: hold down the center board." Now if the centerboard would rise up, the boat would be like a canoe, and if you put the centerboard down, you could steer it better. She said, "You have to hold down the center board because I lost the cotter pin." The cotter pin was something that you could put in and hook and it would hold the centerboard down. So we started on the race, and it was a very quiet day, there wasn't much wind. But we went around the racecourse, and as we were coming toward the finish, and we were going to go straight, Barbara said, "I don't know what you're doing, but keep doing it" because she was gaining on the person that she was most in competition with. So all of a sudden, when she said, "I don't know what you're doing, but keep doing it," I realized I was so interested in the race that I forgot to hold the centerboard down, so we were like a canoe and we were going faster than the other fellow that had the resistance of the centerboard in the boat.         When I worked at Fort Monmouth, I used to drive over there every morning and every evening. I lived in Locust for thirty-three years, and I used to think it was the most beautiful view on earth. I'd go over the bridge and to my left I could see the Navesink River, and Clay Pit Creek, and beyond that was a row of houses along Sea Bright, and beyond that was the ocean. And if I turned -- I saw the hills, of course, the hills of Highlands  if I turned to the right, I saw the river and the beautiful trees and hills and it was pretty - when it was cloudy it was pretty, when it was sunny it was pretty. And I used to think, "If somebody blindfolded me, and took me a thousand miles away and took the blindfold off and I could see the river and the ocean and the hills, I'd think it was the most beautiful sight that ever was." So that was important to me. Now I live at the other end of the river, and they have lots of sailboat races. People in the Monmouth Boat Club in Red Bank make boats out of fiberglass  they have different classes of boats, and they also have classes teaching the children to sail. And there are sun boats, or something, you see the little boats out there in the river with the little sails and you know they're teaching the children to sail. In the winter when the river freezes over, and it doesn't freeze over as much now, in the year 2000, as it did maybe forty years ago, they have iceboats. The ice would get maybe fourteen inches thick or more. They have the National Regatta of the iceboats here in Red Bank, right out in front of our windows. They also have a National Sweepstakes Regatta, up and down the river. And there used to be somebody named Guy Lombardo. He always played at New Year's Eve. But he also had a speedboat, and he'd go back and forth around the river. He won quite often. And it was like the Nascar, or the Indiana 500, but it was in boats. For that weekend you'd know that you just couldn't rest or relax Saturday and Sunday because of the terrific sound of the boats, BRRRRRRRRRRRURURUR, all afternoon long. The only quiet was when one race had finished and they had to get the boats that had just been racing out of the water and put the new boats in.    Ms. West: Do they still have the regattas of these out on the water now?    Ms. Stommel: They have had them up until a year or two ago, I'm not sure right now, because I don't follow the races. People like to see them out our window. Oh, and another thing that's terrific, are the Fourth of July fireworks. We have very special makers of fireworks, which of course are outlawed, but they can have them sponsored by a town. People come from all over to see the Red Bank fireworks. A barge comes out, not too far in front of us. It looks as if they're putting the fireworks on just for us. The Asbury Park radio station has music, and the fireworks are synchronized with the music. And they're just fantastic.    Ms. West: Does your room overlook the river?    Ms. Stommel: No, but I visit a friend whose room does. Forty years or so ago, I used to go to the Rullmans for the Fourth of July, and we would go out the back of their house and down the driveway to where the garage was and we'd watch the fireworks. And a firework would go up, splashing lights and everything, and then you'd have to wait about fifteen or twenty minutes before another one went up. And then you'd have to wait maybe another five or ten minutes, although it seemed a lot longer to me. And of course it wasn't paid for by the town, and the fireworks were expensive, so they didn't have too many. Now they get collections from residents, from people in Navesink House, from stores, from everything else, and they hire this terrific fireworks maker, I wish I could remember his name. And a barge is just loaded with the fireworks, they keep going up, PWEW, PWEW, PWEW, PWEW. And, as I say, people from all over come. After they're over, there's a steady stream of cars leaving Red Bank, oh, for a good hour probably. And then the boats. People who have boats come from all over to the Red Bank area, and you see all the lights on the boats and after the fireworks end, there's a steady stream of boats and lights going down the river to peoples' homes. People who live on the river in Fair Haven enjoy the boats going by as much as they enjoy the fireworks. Now, of course, that's celebrating the Fourth of July and the birth of our country and its patriotism, and I don't how long that's going to keep going.         After I left Fort Monmouth, I formed my own business. I did the same thing that I had done at Fort Monmouth, only for myself. One of my contracts was with CMCE, the Canadian Marconi Electronics, which was a United States subsidiary of Canadian Marconi.    Ms. West: And that was located where?    Ms. Stommel: Well, their company was on Industrial Way, which is below the Monmouth Mall on Route 36 at Exit 105 from the Garden State Parkway. It was the town of Eatontown. They wanted to make a proposal for a contract at Fort Monmouth  this was a private company that was doing business with Fort Monmouth. The very interesting thing to me was the cooperation and the coordination between industry and the military. We had to have industry to manufacture the equipment that the military are going to use, and they had to know what the military needed, and that was very important for the Armed Forces Communications Electronic Association and its chapter in Fort Monmouth. Now I was very pleased, you see, to have my own company  I was very pleased that the national group of the Armed Forces Communications Electronics Association had me as a guest, an honored guest, at the head table of their national convention in Washington. I guess that was probably the highlight. I still have the dress that I bought to wear at the head table. To get back to Canadian Marconi and the contract, they wanted to make a proposal  they had to have a proposal which had to be written in a certain way to present to the contractors at Fort Monmouth who would then decide if they could make it. And one of the members of the CMCE phoned me and said, "This is a voice out of the past, but I wondered if you would be interested in writing this contract." Well, I was very interested in it. I used to go there to that office, and there was a five-part contract that various members, various employees, of this company would prepare, and what I had to write primarily was the technical report, but there were four others also. And this was Monmouth County  I used to go from Locust to Eatontown to prepare this thing. It was a proposal for a hand-held device, like a remote control for a TV set. The hand-held device had a computer inside of it, which would simulate the messages that a young soldier on patrol would send back to the mother radio station. Within a radius of about two hundred and fifty miles, he could tell if he saw an enemy, if somebody in his patrol had been shot, where he was, and why he was there  he would give all kinds of intelligence over his hand-held device to a radio station, the mother radio station, that could be two hundred miles away. Well, in order for the young recruit to learn how to use that device, they would have to stage an exercise of about two hundred and fifty miles somewhere down in the South. What was needed was a simulator, a hand-held device that would be like a remote control on the television set, that the young recruit could take back to his barracks and practice sending messages on. And he would get responses from the computer that was inside the device. There wouldn't be a computer in the simulator he had in the field, but there was a computer in the one he had. Well, Canadian Marconi Electronics got the contract for Fort Monmouth and then I wrote the instruction manual.    Ms. West: Did this device have a particular name?    Ms. Stommel: Yes, it was call UROS, the User Read Out Simulator.    Ms. West: And that was developed here in Monmouth County in Eatontown?    Ms. Stommel: It was developed in Monmouth County in Eatontown. And Fort Monmouth was very significant and important. I would say probably the highlight in my life was that I was the information specialist at the laboratory. Getting back to UROS, the hand held device. The whole system was called PLRS, a Position Locator  I forget what the R was, but System. And it was part of JTIDS, which was the Joint Tactical Information Distribution System. They would distribute this information that the soldiers had. The mother radio station could pinpoint the location of that fellow with the readout within a radius of twelve feet. So the fantastic thing was that with electronics, computers, radios, and what Fort Monmouth Communication Systems worked out, there would no longer be a lost battalion like there was in World War I, when a whole battalion of troops were lost because nobody knew where they were. With this location readout system they could tell where their patrols were. Fort Monmouth developed the communications, the computers, the radios, the telephones, the teletypewriters, and all kinds of electronic communications, not only for the Army, but for the Air Force, Navy, and Marines as well.        Let me tell you about Patriot's Isle. Patriot's Isle was just a plot of grass in the middle of Sycamore Avenue in front of the Episcopal church, right past Broad Street and Sycamore Avenue in Shrewsbury. It's right by the Episcopal Church where the ball was on the steeple that the patriot's fired at. I belong to the DAR, and on Memorial Day we always have a ceremony with Boy Scouts and the mayor and so forth, memorializing our patriots from the World Wars, the Korean War, Vietnam, and so forth. We present a floral wreath that we put on a standard carrier there. There are lots of those floral wreaths to memorialize the veterans from our wars, and it's there by the flag. The amusing part about Patriot's Isle was that at the far end of the Isle was a post office, a small post office of course, because it was there on the grass, but it was the only post office in the United States that was in the middle of the street. But they have removed that post office  it's no longer there.    Ms. West: Do they still have the ceremonies?    Ms. Stommel: They have the ceremony every Memorial Day. And most of people come to it. They listen to the speeches and representatives carry the floral wreaths down to the flag, and of course, afterwards the children have a marvelous time because the firehouse has a picnic with hot dogs and soda.    Ms. West: So it's an all day affair.    Ms. Stommel: Well, it's around from ten thirty until one o'clock or so, after lunch. Of course they have those ceremonies all over the county. Fire engines in the parade, boy scouts and girl scouts marching. We don't have a parade there in Shrewsbury, but there's a place right out here near Navesink House where Riverside Avenue and Broad Street meet, there's a little triangle, they have a cannon there and they have a ceremony on Memorial Day.    Ms. West: The cannon represents what war?    Ms. Stommel: Oh, I'm sorry, I don't know. Probably the Revolutionary War. I don't know if they used those cannons in a World War. They're obsolete. One thing that's very interesting and getting back to Patriot's Isle. Mrs. Bruce Campbell lived there on Sycamore Avenue in Shrewsbury and used to volunteer out at Marlboro State Hospital. Her son Bruce Campbell was killed on the Anzio beachhead in World War II, and his monument is there. And also Lance Corporal Dorn was killed in Vietnam. He was the son of Danny Dorn, who has Dorn's photo shop on Wallace Street in Red Bank. And Danny Dorn has the most terrific collection of photographs of Red Bank, of all kinds. One thing that's very interesting to me is that the Korean War, it was only called a conflict, because you couldn't call it a war. It was called the Korean Conflict, and I think that that was politics, probably, that they wouldn't call it a war.    Ms. West: Okay, well we're going to end our little conversation now, and once again, we thank you very much for giving us this bit of history and letting us in on a portion of your life.    Ms. Stommel: Thank you so much, Ms. West.    Ms. West: Thank you.   
MonmouthCounty;Anna Nichols and Martha Nichols Rakita;1925;2000;Anna Nichols and Martha Nichols Rakita, 1925, 2000        Remembering The 20th Century: An Oral History of Monmouth County    Date of Interview: September 18, 2000  Name of Interviewer: Rhoda Newman  Premises of Interview: 31 Ocean Pathway, Ocean Grove, NJ  Birthdate(s) of Subject(s): Martha Nichols Rakita: February 6, 1922                                                  Anna Catherine Nichols: April 18, 1927    Ms. Newman: Martha Rakita is affiliated with the Historical Society of Ocean Grove. She holds the position of past president. Anna Nichols has been a Trustee of the Ocean Grove Camp Meeting Association for twenty-four years.  Now, you both are sisters. Please tell me how long you have been in Ocean Grove, what your early memories are, and what changes you've seen happen here.    Ms. Nichols: I've been in Ocean Grove since I was six weeks old. My mother brought me here then. I don't know how old Martha was when she came here.    Ms. Newman: Ocean Grove has something unique in the country, and that is the Methodist Camp Meeting in Ocean Grove. Can you just describe the tents for people who aren't familiar with the Methodist Camp Meeting?    Ms. Nichols: There are one hundred and fourteen tents. Ocean Grove was established as a camp meeting association, which meant that people came here for a camp meeting, pitched their own tents, had their camp meeting week or weeks, and when it was over they went home. It usually lasted two to three weeks. The central auditorium was a huge tent, and everybody just pitched their own tents around it. Eventually the auditorium became a permanent structure, and the tents started being more permanent. In the wintertime, what you see in the tent colony are platforms with a small building behind it. In the summertime what you see are canvas tents over the platforms and then you don't see the little cottage because the tent covers the whole thing. In the wintertime everything that you have in the canvas part of the tent is put back into the cottage  in the summer, it's all brought back out again. Every tent is the same, and every tent is different. They are the same in that they're almost all approximately the same size and made the same way. They are different in that everybody's personality is in their own tent. And so no two tents are even remotely alike.    Ms. Rakita: Well, there are today a hundred and fourteen tents left. But as a child I can remember many tents along Wesley Lake, up in the Northern end of Wesley Lake very close to the ocean. Many, many tents. I can remember many tents. Wesley Lake separates Ocean Grove from Asbury Park. But my point is that in the years that I remember, there were many more tents in Ocean Grove then there are today. There were many tents, many tents, down in what we call the South end of town, near Fletcher Lake. Rows and rows of tents. Fletcher Lake separates Ocean Grove from Bradley Beach. Where the retirement home, Frances Asbury, is now used to be a tent colony. So that's one of the things that I remember. My sister was talking about decoration, the use of doors on the tents, which is an anachronism. It is an anachronism to have this canvas structure and then a wooden door on that canvas structure. This has come about within the last twenty to thirty years. As a child growing up, nobody had a door on their tent. We used the canvas and we tied the canvas together at night. On a very, very hot night, my mother wouldn't close the flaps, she would just use a fabric screen which she put it across the front of the tent because it made it a lot cooler. And that's a big difference that I remember as a child versus now. Of course another big difference that I remember as a child, and I'm thinking now of the early Depression years, 1930 and 1935. I think there were more tents not erected than those that were put up, because people could not afford a rental. This was the depths of Depression, and Ocean Grove, for all its history, has not attracted a wealthy clientele, so their clientele was really hit by the Depression. And many, many, many of the tents were never put up because they were not rented. My point is that the empty tent platforms were a wonderful place for kids to play. I mean we could skate, we could play Parcheesi, we could have a doll house. It was a marvelous place to play for kids.    Ms. Nichols: Well, mostly Martha played those kind of games. I guess we played handball on the platform because we had a wooden background, and it was a perfect place to play handball, to play tennis, like you would on the tennis court, although actually I didn't have a tennis racquet, I had kind of a paddle ball type of thing. But it was still the same kind of thing. But it was a wonderful place to play. The rent was twenty-five dollars a season.    Ms. Rakita: The rentals on the tents are slightly different, depending on the square footage of the tent. I think my mother said she paid fifty dollars during the Depression for a four month season. That's May 15 until September 15. So it's twelve dollars and fifty cents a month rental. But in those days, as today, the tenter did all the work. The tenter brings all the furniture, does all of the gardening  the Camp Meeting only sets the tent up and takes it down. This is not a criticism of the camp, but it's always been this way  that's the only thing that they have done. The rest of the decorations and the improvements are all done by renters. So it's not quite as cheap as it sounds, because if you rented somewhere else, you'd walk in and even the beds might be made, and that's not true in a tent. But rentals today are still comparatively low, about thirty-five hundred, although some of the big tents cost as much as four thousand a season. For a four month season, at the very highest, the rent is a thousand dollars a month. You can't get a place in Long Beach Island for a thousand dollars a week these days.     Ms. Newman: So you came here during the summers and spent some time in the tents.    Ms. Nichols: Oh, yes! We spent the whole summer here. My father was a teacher. And so we came here all summer. Actually, my parents took us out of school before school was over for some reason. I guess because the last few weeks of school are kind of a waste of time anyway for little kids. And we stayed until probably the week after Labor Day, because school started later then. And so we spent the entire summer here.    Ms. Newman: Would the families who were here come back each season?    Ms. Rakita: The same as it is now. We have friends that we made as children here whose descendents come. And some of the same people we knew are still coming down to the tents.    Ms. Nichols: Louise Bown is a good case in point. She lived on a tent on Pilgrim Pathway, and now her daughter has a tent on Central Avenue.    Ms. Rakita: And she was a very good friend of mine. So I've known her from the time I was ten years old right up to now.    Ms. Newman: So the traditions carry on.        Left to right: Anna Nichols, Martha Nichols Rakita, and Martha's daughter, Nancy Rakita Winn in front of the tents in Ocean Grove    Ms. Nichols: It's not a hundred percent that there's been a tradition carried on. But as the tents get harder and harder to get, I think the tradition will flourish because people will be unwilling to give them up. There is a very long waiting list for tents, and there is now a waiting list for cottages, too. So it has changed a lot from the point of view that we never had a lock on our tent  when you didn't have doors, there was no lock there. But even the middle part, which had a door, and probably a lock for the winter, although I don't remember it, was never locked. The whole tent was just open front to back. And it never occurred to us that anybody would ever go in there or do anything, and nobody ever did. I'm not sure that would be true today, although I don't know if it would be so much malice as curiosity. If I left my tent open, I really wouldn't trust that somebody wouldn't walk through and look at it. Because I was having a group of people come one day, and at the end of the line, there were people I didn't know, and I said, "Can I help you?" And they said, "Oh, we just wanted to see your tent." So people will walk in. Another funny thing, during the Depression, we always had to rent a tent by the summer. At the very beginning of the 1900s, the Camp Meeting Association was renting them by the week for a while, because it was in the old records. But people would walk by, and my mother always got the biggest laugh out of this: they would walk by and very carefully explain to their friends that these tents were for poor people who were brought here for a week in the summertime to have a vacation and then they went home and some more poor people came down the next week. And the camp meeting did this as a service to the poor people of Philadelphia for some reason. Well, that was about as far from the truth as you can get! Nowadays there are plenty of wealthy people in the tents, but not at that time. I think we weren't poor, but certainly nobody was rich. My father had a job, that was being rich. So that was a funny story that I can remember, and I've heard it so many times myself. And my mother told that story probably a hundred times because she got such a kick out of it. But it has evolved from a kind of community where you wouldn't find a lock on anybody's door to the tents being locked up and really carefully boarded up in the winter. But there again, when people break into the tents in the winter, it's very seldom for mischief, it's usually kids who want to have a clubhouse, or maybe a homeless person who needs a place to stay. But very, very little thievery goes on in the wintertime. And it's a tent, anybody can break in, even though it's a wooden structure, but usually we don't have that kind of problem. Cottages have more problems than we do in the tent colony. It has happened. But it's rare. Breaking in is common, but losing anything is rare. They usually just come in. I mean, my mother can remember a time when somebody came into her tent and lived there all winter long. And nobody knew it until she got down and realized that all the bed clothing was out, and the dishes were all out, and there was food around. So people had lived there, but they didn't do anything bad, they just made a mess of the place. So when Ocean Grove opened its streets, it didn't affect life in the tent colony very much except that I think our security became a little bit more of an issue.    Ms. Newman: Can you explain a little about the chains on the gate?    Ms. Nichols: Well, yes. Up until 1979 there were actually chains on the gates on Main Avenue, Stockton Avenue, and Broadway, and you couldn't drive in here. The only vehicles that were around in Ocean Grove on Sunday were doctors' cars, police, and firemen. No one else. You weren't even allowed to ride a bicycle. You weren't allowed to go on the beach. Well, if you were fully clothed you were allowed to go on the beach, but you weren't allowed to go in the ocean on Sunday. So there have been changes since then when we were actually closed, but as I said, when the gates opened, the effect on the tent colony was rather minimal. It didn't change the personnel, it didn't change the way we lived, except we were just a little more conscientious about security because people could get in and out a lot faster if they have cars. We had our own police department before the gates were open. And our own police department was very conscientious about watching over Ocean Grove. Then when the gates opened, Neptune took over, and they only have two cars assigned to Ocean Grove at any one time. I think that's why Ben Douglas felt that he should start the Ocean Grove Civilian Patrol, so that we'd have a little bit more of a presence of some kind of security.    Ms. Newman: Tell us about Sundays when you were growing up.    Ms. Rakita: Sundays were a little difficult for a kid because of all the "don'ts." You couldn't go swimming, and I can remember one very hot Sunday when I went to the beach fully clothed, I went down to the water and I was wet all the way to my waist. My mother was very understanding and never said a word. Because I couldn't go swimming, I just went wading, and I was fully clothed. You couldn't ride your bicycles, couldn't play cards, but there was one thing that we did on Sunday afternoon. There would be the church service in the morning, and then there would be a men's bible class from two to four. And then after that I would go into the auditorium and hunt for pennies. People would drop nickels and pennies on the floor as the offering was being taken. Well, that was not a very good Sunday activity. But the auditorium was open, and I can remember doing that a lot on Sundays. One of the big things that's different now in the tents versus when we were growing up, was we had no hot water. All we had was a toilet. My sister now has a full bathroom, a tub, a lovely shower, a sink - all we had was a toilet and a sink. So it was very important for us to go to the beach every day because that's the way we got our bath. And of course at the beach you changed your clothes in the bathhouse because you were not allowed to walk on the streets of Ocean Grove in a bathing suit. So you changed your clothes and they had beautiful showers and you could soap up so it was very practical and that's the way kids, adults, everybody took their bath. If we had a stretch of long, bad weather, my mother would heat up some water on the stove, and she had a great big iron tub and we would take a bath in the tub.    Ms. Newman: But you had running water.    Ms. Rakita: Oh, yes, we had running water, but there was no hot water, it was just cold water.    Ms. Newman: Do you remember when hot water came in?    Ms. Nichols: My parents had their tent rebuilt in 1955 and I believe this is when we installed hot water because they had a tub and a shower installed in a real bathroom.    Ms. Rakita: I remember the cold water so it couldn't have been before - let's say it came in well after World War II.    Ms. Nichols: I would guess that would probably be when, too.    Ms. Rakita: My mother would never have come to the tent unless it had a lavatory. But many tents did not have toilets, and there were privies throughout the tent colonies for those people who didn't have plumbing in the tents.    Ms. Nichols: When we say that we had hot water, this is probably because my mother and father decided to put in hot water. Because ten years ago there were still people who didn't have hot water in the tents, and then Neptune came in and said, "You must not only have hot water, but you must have showers in the tents." And so they put in certain code enforcements, and an awful lot of showers suddenly appeared on the back porch of tents, and hot water heaters also. But I'm positive that we had hot water in our tent only because my parents decided to do that.    Ms. Newman: Where was your home when you were growing up?    Ms. Rakita: Philadelphia.    Ms. Newman: How long did it take you to get from Philadelphia to Ocean Grove?    Ms. Nichols: Well, my father had a car, so I guess two hours.    Ms. Rakita: It seemed like a tremendously long ride, but it really wasn't. We came through Trenton, and then after you got on the outskirts of Trenton, you had a choice of going down Route 33 to Hightstown or going the "wheat way," which was still all farms  it was a country road, and I'm sure it has a number now, that we took to get to Hightstown. One of the other things that was very common in the thirties and forties and fifties, which is not quite so common today, is that the man of the house brought the family down to Ocean Grove for the summer time, and then he was here only for the weekends. Early Monday morning he got up and drove to New York, or to Philadelphia, and went to business for the week. Went to his own home for the week.    Ms. Newman: So during the week it was just women and children.    Ms. Rakita: Yes. And this was very, very, very, very common. And then on Friday night the men would come back down and they would be here for the weekend.    Ms. Nichols: See, commuting back then was not as easy as it is now. I mean a man can now commute to work every day and come back to Ocean Grove at night, but then it wasn't that easy. So if you worked outside of Ocean Grove, you stayed out until the weekend.    Ms. Newman: But there were trains?    Ms. Nichols: There were trains coming in from New York, but none coming in from Philadelphia.    Ms. Rakita: Never has been a direct train from Philadelphia.    Ms. Nichols: The bus service from Philadelphia used to be marvelous, but now it's non-existent. But my father got rid of his car because he was a totally incompetent driver. He got rid of his car right before the second World War, and he never got another one. So he took the bus back and forth. Marvelous bus service. But no train service.    Ms. Newman: When you grew up you went into teaching, Anna?    Ms. Nichols: Well, I went to college and I learned to be a Physical Education Teacher and I also taught swimming here for many years.    Ms. Rakita: Now, that's very important, she's being very modest. She taught, literally, two generations of kids to swim.    Ms. Nichols: I did it for thirty-three years.     Ms. Rakita: She did it for thirty-three years  that's how you get the two generations. She got the job because of my dear Mr. Hess, who was the swimming teacher. I loved Mr. Hess, and he loved me. The Hesses had no children, so I was like their daughter. And I just loved Mr. Hess. To make a long story short, now I realize that at a rather young age, Mr. Hess went blind. It was the summer of 1943, and they couldn't get anybody to teach swimming. And here is this gal who is this marvelous swimmer, so at age fourteen, correct me if I'm wrong, my sister started teaching swimming at the North End pool.    Ms. Newman: The North End pool near the boardwalk?    Ms. Nichols: It's behind the North End Hotel.    Ms. Rakita: It's still there, and for those of us who swam in it all our lives, it's a sad, sad site. It's a huge hole in the ground with a lot of junk in it now. But it was a large, fifty yard by about twenty yards, salt water pool. And the water was not free-flowing  the water was changed three times a week.    Ms. Nichols: Every Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday night the pool water was dumped.    Ms. Rakita: It never circulated, and it never had any chemicals in there, it was just salt water.    Ms. Newman: So it was pumped manually?    Ms. Nichols: Well, there were pumps out in the ocean and no, it wasn't pumped manually. There was a machine that was turned on and it pulled the water down through the sand into the pumps so that filtered it and brought it back into the pool. The downside of that is that if the ocean was cold, the pool was cold. And so it was really sometimes unswimmable because it was so cold.    Ms. Newman: When did the pool close down?    Ms. Nichols: Probably in the early 1980s.    Ms. Rakita: Well, Mom died in 1989, and was she still swimming in the pool the last couple of years of her life.    Ms. Nichols: Yes, come to think of it, I think she was.    Ms. Rakita: The pool remained open long after the whole North End complex was closed. The pool was still available.    Ms. Newman: And you kept on teaching swimming?    Ms. Nichols: No, I stopped teaching in 1977.    Ms. Rakita: Mr. Hess charged five dollars for eight lessons, and so when my sister took it over, she also charged five dollars for eight lessons.    Ms. Nichols: Well, the fee was assigned for the swimming lessons by the Camp Meeting Association, so I agreed.    Ms. Newman: You were fourteen, and in those days it was quite a lot of money, was it not?    Ms. Rakita: But the point of it is, we were having inflation so that was perfectly okay to do. When I think now of the insurance rate and everything -- there was no guard in the pool either -- that the Camp Meeting Association allowed a fourteen year old girl without any credentials other than the fact that she was an excellent swimmer, to teach swimming lessons for money. But they were very happy to have somebody to do it.    Ms. Nichols: We got a swimming team together and our swimming team was the best in the area. We went undefeated for eight years. The kids were really good, and most of them eventually became lifeguards, and now their children are lifeguards, and that kind of thing. But the pool was really the center of social life in Ocean Grove. Unfortunately, the Camp Meeting Association in its questionable wisdom closed it because it wasn't making any money. When I was teaching I had hundreds of kids, and seventy-five kids on the swimming team. And every kid has a mother, a father, a grandmother, grandfather, sister and brother, so one kid on my team would attract five or six other people from their family to come to the pool. When I stopped teaching, somebody took over, but the program died in less than three years. It just bottomed out and people stopped coming. So it became a financial drain on the Camp Meeting Association to continue to run the pool. They should have done it anyway. It was probably, in hindsight, which is always 20/20, the dumbest mistake they made, closing the North End. Dismantling the merry-go-round was another dumb mistake. Those kinds of things would have kept that a vital region, but they decided to go down to nothing. It was a shame.    Ms. Newman: Do you ever see it coming back?    Ms. Nichols: Possibly not as it was. The land is too valuable now. A few houses along Ocean Pathway are now worth a half a million dollars. That land is probably worth four or five million dollars now. And so some developer will be coming in there and probably put up some kind of a high rise condo. Well, it can't be more than five floors, but there will be some kind of a condo or something. So it's unlikely that particular of land will ever be used for a swimming pool again unless the developer comes in with the idea of developing a really great recreational complex.    Ms. Rakita: But that's kind of left to chance. It's part of what we remember. Growing up in the tents and being swimmers and everything. Getting back to tent life -    Ms. Newman: Most of the people who came to the tents came from elsewhere, didn't they? They didn't live in Ocean Grove.    Ms. Nichols: That's generally true. Ocean Grove's winter population was really quite small, although now this is really a winter resort as well as a summer. But then the place just emptied out in winter. I think there were eight thousand people living here in the winter time and over a hundred thousand in the summer. But that's no longer true.    Ms. Newman: When you were kids, was there interaction with the town kids?    Ms. Nichols: No.    Ms. Rakita: Not much. You were known as to whether you swam at the North End or the South End.    Ms. Newman: What were the social distinctions?    Ms. Rakita: Well, just that if you lived in this area, uptown, you swam at the North End, and if you lived maybe the other side of Main Avenue, or certainly the other side of Broadway, you swam at South End.    Ms. Newman: And Ocean Grove is just one mile square.    Ms. Rakita: Yes, right. But even that was a division, because the bulk of the single family year round housing is south of Main Avenue. The Southenders weren't all year rounders, but the year rounders swam at South End, and the summer people swam definitely at the North end. This area had very, very few houses where people lived year round. There's one house in the tent colony where the people lived year round.    Ms. Newman: Martie, can you tell us about the historical society and your role in it?    Ms. Rakita: Oh, sure. It was formed in 1970 and was really the impetus of the hundredth celebration in 1969 when Ocean Grove had a big celebration for its hundredth anniversary. To celebrate that anniversary, a family by the name of Skold gave a absolutely authentic Victorian cottage to the camp meeting, and it was moved and set up in a piece of ground at McClintok and Central Avenue and it was called Centennial Cottage because it was set up on the hundredth anniversary of Ocean Grove. The woman who was most instrumental in getting it set up was a woman by the name of Edith Ashenback, who is still living. She's ninety-eight years old. And she was also able to get beautiful Victorian antiques to furnish this lovely but very modest little Victorian cottage. Well, this caused an interest in Ocean Grove history, and the historical society was born in 1970. The Camp Meeting Association suggested that the Historical Society take over the management of Centennial Cottage. And we have done so ever since. We have grown since that time. We have a very interesting relationship with the Camp Meeting Association in that there are two pieces of property. This is Centennial Cottage, which the Association owns but for which we have spent within the last five years, without any exaggeration, thirty thousand dollars. We have gotten matching grants for that kind of money. The Camp Meeting Association also owned Beersheba, which was in dreadful condition, in 1976.    Ms. Newman: This was in Auditorium Square.    Ms. Nichols: It was the first well driven in Ocean Grove.    Ms. Rakita: And as a present to the town, the Historical Society restored Beersheba in 1976, and since that time we have taken over the care of Beersheba. In 1994 we again did a complete restoration. We put an entirely new hand-cut cedar tile roof on it. Each tile is hand cut in an interesting diamond cut shape. We repaired the gingerbread, all that sort of thing. And now we're painting it on a four year schedule. I was looking at it as I went past just a couple days ago, and although it is not due to be painted until the year 2002, it's starting to break through already.    Ms. Newman: Salt air does it.    Ms. Rakita: By June 2002 it's going to need it again desperately.    Ms. Newman: Beersheba is the symbol for the Historical Society.    Ms. Rakita: Yes, that's the logo for the historical society, which is one of the reasons that we feel we want to keep it in pristine condition. But there again, it doesn't belong to us, it belongs to the Camp Meeting Association, so it's a very interesting relationship we have. But back to tents. The one thing that I can remember as a kid in the tents was that, of course, most of the women who were here all week long had no cars. There were quite a few grocery stores in Ocean Grove: there was an A&P on Pilgrim Pathway, there was an Acme on Main Avenue, there was also what we now call Pathway Market. It was called Strassbergers in those days. The ice man came through every day, and because nobody had an electric box, everybody had an ice box. There were two or three men who came through town with fresh vegetables. Wasn't there also a fish man?    Ms. Newman: Oh, yes. And Mrs. Thompson's very famous pies. Mrs. Wagner's pies started in Ocean Grove in those days, too.    Ms. Rakita: When we were having a northeasterner, with three days of rain, we would walk across the bridges to Cookman Avenue in Asbury Park. There were beautiful shops, and we went to Steinbach's, and we went to Tepper's, which was another very nice family clothing store. There were shoe stores on Cookman Avenue, there was a huge Woolworth's, there was a Newbury's, there was a McCrory's, and a Kresge's, so it was a shopping paradise. Not that we had a lot of money, but that kind of shopping was available to you on those special occasions.    Ms. Newman: You had milkmen come?    Ms. Rakita: Oh, yes.    Ms. Newman: There was a dairy down the South End near the Broadway entrance, wasn't there?    Ms. Rakita: Yes. But the milkman came, the iceman came, and as my sister said, the breadman came, Dugan's breadman came, the vegetable man came. In the alley between Olin Street and Main Avenue there was a shoe maker, and I was petrified of this shoe maker. I was scared to death of that man. He seemed to me to be about eight feet tall, although I'm sure he wasn't. And he had bushy eyebrows, and was very gruff, and I was petrified of him.    Ms. Nichols: He had a long, long mustache. And he had a very low voice and a very fierce face. But to show you how small his shoe store was, his store is now some bakery or something, a little coffee shop, that two people couldn't fit in at the same time. That was his store. We didn't go through that alley because we were all afraid of him. I mean it wasn't just Martha and me, every kid in Ocean Grove was afraid of him. We wouldn't go through that alley because we were scared to death of him, and he always sat outside in the alley. I'm sure he was a wonderful, gentle man, but he looked like a giant, and his mustache made him look very fierce, and we were all scared to death of him.    Ms. Rakita: I think he was Italian. Here's another thing which is really nice. I think I have been permanently influenced in an appreciation of and understanding of organ music because our tent was right next to the Great Auditorium, and every day there was an organ concert at three o'clock. And at the end of the organ concert, they always played this piece that had been written years ago by an Ocean Grove organist by the name of Reynolds. It's called "The Storm at Sea." And the organ even had lightening. By pushing various buttons you had thunder, you had lightening, it was a wonderful piece. And so it was a real privilege to grow up constantly hearing this organ. And then Josephine Eddowes was a very nice, talented organist. And then we had two or three very fine organists, and by the time I was married, we got Gordon Turk, and of course we've had Gordon Turk for twenty-seven years. The organist that I remember as a child was Clarence Coleman. He was a man who weighed about three hundred and fifty pounds, he was huge, grossly, grossly, grossly overweight. He lived at the hotel on Main Avenue and New York Avenue, and if he wasn't at the organ he was always on the front porch there. He was a good organist - but none of the organists that we had growing up can hold a candle to Gordon Turk. He is a consummate artist. We had none of that. But the organ was in dreadful shape, too. I'm not taking anything away from Gordon, but one of the reasons that Gordon can play so well is that the organ has been upgraded from fifteen hundred pipes to nine thousand, and forty ranks to one hundred and fifty-five ranks. It's huge. It's a much finer instrument than it was in the old days. Growing up listening to that organ all my life made a permanent impression. Being an usher has always carried a social status in Ocean Grove, and my father became an usher in 1944. The ushers wore white suits, they did not wear the blue coats and the white pants as they do today. When my father first became an usher, we didn't have the money for him to just go to a store and buy a white suit, so we all put money together and bought him a white suit for Christmas. The rhythm of the program in the summer time definitely affected the tent colony. And of course the other thing that I can remember, especially in the 1940s, after things got to be a little bit better, was those tremendous crowds attending the Sunday Service. Seven thousand people was not unusual at all. Sometimes eight or nine thousand attended.    Ms. Newman: This is when there were well known preachers?    Ms. Rakita: Yes, and because you didn't have the distraction of other things, and it just was very popular thing to do. I'm only talking about the Sunday service, and the support system that you needed for that. In those days, there were just block after block after block of what you would call boarding houses, where people had a room, and the bathroom was down the hall, and they very often took their meals at the boarding house. Sometimes they went to Main Avenue to the Grand Atlantic Cafeteria or the Sampler Inn. What I remember was that in the summer time the hotels and boarding houses were all full. This is a ghost town compared to what it used to be. It's wonderful what has happened to Ocean Grove lately, and the resurgence that we have had here, but we don't have the crowds that we used to have. We do have pretty good crowds on Saturday nights now.    Ms. Newman: What accounted for the decline in numbers? Transportation was better, so people went elsewhere?    Ms. Nichols: Well, first of all, the Garden State Parkway came in. So instead of having to come down and stay overnight, people could come down for the day. And that started being a pattern rather than an exception. Then just getting back and forth became so easy - when everything had to depend on busses and trains, it was much different so people would stay. A trip was a big occasion. When cars were just part of the scene, then people could get out in just a matter of hours. And so that changed the complex in a way. Then everything started to evolve when television came in, and forms of entertainment, even forms of going to church changed. People could watch televangelists, which is unfortunate, but they could, and now I think they've learned, and they don't do that so much anymore. Because televangelists dug their own grave. But you asked did we have very famous preachers early on. They weren't so much famous preachers as they were orators. Because there was no acoustical equipment in the auditorium holding ten thousand people, speakers had to be orators. This was everybody's manner of worship, but it was also what Ocean Grove was all about. So people came here to hear these great orators. And now we have probably more famous preachers than any other place in the country coming here. Now we have marvelous acoustics, we have more famous preachers, and we get the very finest preachers in the world. It's a real feather in somebody's cap to be invited to speak in Ocean Grove. Very prestigious. So we actually have more famous people now than we had then, but those people were more adored then than the people are now. People got involved. We had the same preachers year after year after year, because I guess you had to have the orators, and I guess you got to love them, and so they would come for a week just to hear one certain person, that type of thing.    Ms. Rakita: Another thing that was very important in growing up here was participation in the youth program. As a little kid I went to Thornley Chapel. And I remember something that nobody else remembers but I know I have not made it up. After Chapel, we used to have calisthenics in Auditorium Park, and I don't know, maybe it was only for a year or so. You were four years old when you went to Chapel, and then when you were twelve or thirteen you were too old to go and you went to the Youth Temple.    Ms. Newman: Was Thornley Chapel like Sunday school?    Ms. Rakita: Yes, but seven days a week, from nine to ten o'clock.    Ms. Nichols: And it's still going on. Except now it's only six days a week. We don't have it on Saturday.    Ms. Rakita: Then you went to the Young People's Temple which was six days a week. The point is, as a young person you were involved in the worship experience here in Ocean Grove. It was done at your level, which was very good. Then after Young People's was over, you could go to the beach, or do some of the other things that we did, maybe help your mother, or whatever.    Ms. Newman: So you would go to the Young People's Temple every day?    Ms. Rakita: Every day. And it wasn't something that you had to do, it was something that you wanted to do, because all your friends were there, and all your friends of the tent colony were there, and everybody that you knew. So that's what you did. It was nice in that there was always a lot to do. Even in those days there were shows and practices, and all that sort of thing. And as a young kid I can remember being on Mr. Hess's swimming team. It wasn't very good, but there were always things to do. So the tradition of a very extensive program for young people in Ocean Grove is an old tradition, and this has been going on for a long time.    Ms. Nichols: This is very important because Ocean Grove has always been known as a place where you go to have your arteries hardened because all the people are very old. I think that conception is probably been mitigated a lot by the extensive youth programs that we have. Really, this is a very youthful town.    Ms. Rakita: Oh, yes, the people coming in include so many young families. People today assume that you can't invite anybody to come see you unless you have a private bedroom and even a private bathroom. That doesn't work in a tent. We had my mother and father and three children. Then my elderly aunt and uncle came down a great deal to visit. Other people came down  our grandmother came for at least a month, and my father always said the tent will expand for however many we were. And when I got married and had three children, it also expanded for us - but only for an occasional visit    Ms. Newman: What year was that?    Ms. Rakita: I got married in 1944. I brought my own family down here in the 1950s. It was my mother and my father and my sister in the tent, and then it was my husband and I and our two sons in the two front bunks, and for quite a few years my daughters slept on a beach chair because there wasn't anything else left to sleep on. Well, my middle boy slept on the floor, and we brought the playpen for my daughter to sleep in. When I was a teenager, I invited my boyfriend to come and he stayed. As my dad always said, the tent just expands. So then along about 1979 or 1980 I invited this friend of mine to come. It was a girlfriend. It was after my husband had died. She didn't have a private bedroom, and said, "Where am I going to get dressed?" She didn't have a private bathroom. She never came back! So you definitely have to have a certain kind of mindset to enjoy tent life.    Ms. Nichols: We had privacy. Our tent is large, and my mother had screens that went the full length of the tent, and curtains that went the width of the tent. So at night we'd each have our own bedroom because we had a screen on one side and a curtain on the other, and of course the tent on the other two, so we had privacy.    Ms. Rakita: My sister has brought up a very important point. There are two camps in Ocean Grove. There are people who sleep in the canvas, and people who sleep in the cottage. Never the twain shall meet. People who sleep in the canvas love to hear the wind snap the canvas, and they love to hear the squirrels run up and down the holes, and the rain on the canvas roof, and on a hot night, a sweet little breeze coming in the front. If you sleep in the tent, that's what you do. And then there are those that want a little more privacy so they choose to sleep in the cottage and this is much warmer in the cottage, so they came down here early in June and stayed as late as they could in September. You got closer to whatever sanitary facilities there were as the years went by, and that's a very important point. I would say in the beginning most people slept in the tent, and they used the cottage more as a dressing room and as a dining room and as a place to listen to the radio. The kitchens were basically galley kitchens about six feet wide at most with just the stove and the sink and the ice box, so you had to use the cottage part on a rainy day to eat in, and most people used the cottage as their dining room, dressing room, and wardrobe, and so forth. And the beds and everything were in the tent part. But you have to be unselfconscious. It takes a certain mindset.    Ms. Nichols: Of course if you were six weeks old when you went there as I was, your mindset was built in.    Ms. Newman: Sounds like it would be a very happy place to grow up.    Ms. Rakita: Oh, very. Also we just didn't know there were financial problems. We didn't realize it. We were lucky. We weren't rich, but my father didn't lose his job during the Depression, and we had some money. My father was also a very fine editor for the John C. Winston Company, so he had a second source of income. We never felt, and I don't think anybody in the tent colony felt poor. Some people looked on us as being poor, but we didn't feel like it at all. It's interesting to me that there are still a lot of people left who are dying for this lifestyle. I have this wonderful friend whose been on the list for five years, but she just can't get a tent. And I'm hoping for her for next year. She loves the whole idea. She's an artist who also wrote a book. She's going to be a wonderful tenter  she's going to contribute a tremendous amount to Ocean Grove. She happens to be Roman Catholic, and that's a little bit of a problem. It's not a big problem  she would support the Camp Meeting Association. She might have a little bit of a problem. I know that I suggested when she was here that she go hear one of the famous speakers that happened to be there that Sunday, but she said she thought she'd go down to Spring Lake to that beautiful Catholic church. I respect her for that. But my point is, it's interesting to me now that although everybody has to have their own private bedroom and own private bath, there are still people who have the tent mindset.    Ms. Nichols: It's a fairly long waiting list for tents. It used to be ten years long, I don't think it is anymore. But even if you're on the waiting list, if you don't qualify, you won't get one anyway. There has to be some evidence of an interest in Ocean Grove just beyond having a place to go for the summer. Prayers, presence, gifts and service, are the basis of participation in the Methodist Church. So if you're never evident in a service, if you aren't in the choir, aren't in the Historical Society, things like that, if you haven't evidenced any real interest in Ocean Grove or in the mission of the Camp Meeting Association, somebody else who has would jump ahead of you on the waiting list. So when I say the waiting list is ten years long, I mean this could happen  we call somebody up and say, "Well you're finally eligible to get a tent. Do you still want to be on the list?" And they say, "Oh, no, we bought a house four years ago." So the best candidates will weed themselves out. I don't really think it's ten years. But there is a waiting list and there are restrictions on how to get a tent. Not that everybody who lives in a tent does all those things because they don't.    Ms. Newman: Is the Camp Meeting Association ecumenical? Is there a Catholic service?    Ms. Nichols: Yes. Very seldom do we have Methodist preachers. In the fourteen Sundays that we have Sunday services, it could be that five or so might be Methodists, but they are heavily Presbyterian, and Baptist, and things like that. Tony Campola is a Baptist. The Bible Study teachers are almost anything. Just as long as they're good Bible Study teachers, it doesn't matter whether they're Methodist or not. So it's very ecumenical. As a matter of fact, there was a time when I was head of program, and at one point we wanted to see what type of person was coming to the camp meeting services on Sunday morning and Sunday evening. Where were they from? What church did they come from? That type of thing. We were blown away by the fact that most of them were Catholic. That was very unusual. But I took a one hundred and four questionnaires one year, and we might have twenty-five percent Methodist and twenty-five percent something else, but maybe thirty or thirty-five percent Catholic. Which we thought was wonderful. Never knew it before that. I guess because we have such fine preaching and people want to be exposed to it, and so it was an unusual thing to happen. So we have all kinds of people. A lot of Jewish people, Methodist, Presbyterian, Catholic, Baptist, and there are some non denominational, too. But mostly it's the ones that you are more familiar with. We have a very good smattering of all. When a preacher gets up in the auditorium and says it's nice to be talking to a bunch of Methodists, I think to myself, you're not, man, you really aren't. You're talking to the biggest smattering of denominations that you've ever spoken to before, but they don't know that.    Ms. Newman: Now you both are here just in the summers now, is that right?    Ms. Rakita: Yes. I owned a house for fourteen years, I'm a little bit sorry that I sold it, but not really. And I started to go down to Florida because my daughter had the children in Florida, and I wanted to see the grandchildren. And I went for three or four weeks, and then I went for six weeks, then I was staying with her for eight weeks, ten weeks. It wasn't fair, so I got my own place. My sister came down too. Going to Florida in the wintertime is a good thing for retirees. I'm a Floridian now, and I like Florida very much. And of course this is very common pattern here in Ocean Grove.    Ms. Newman: Snowbirds.    Ms. Rakita: Yes, a lot of them are very close in age to me, similar in history, too.    Ms. Nichols: When I was young I thought that things would never change, I thought Ocean Grove would always be closed on Sundays. And even though I like Monday through Saturday better than Monday through Sunday, what do you do on Sunday as a kid? But I never ever wanted it to change. Closing on Sundays was something that made Ocean Grove so unique that it was so apart from anything else that I would know, and I didn't want it to change. I was a member of the Board of Trustees when the decision was made to open the gates on Sundays. There were only two people on the board who voted against it, and I was one of them. The other was Walter Quigg, who was at that time our minister in Ocean Grove at St. Paul's church. Just being able to bring cars in here on Sunday has made a huge difference and made life in Ocean Grove so much different. It brought the world into Ocean Grove.    Ms. Newman: For the better, the worse, or both?    Ms. Nichols: Well, it's according to what standpoint - it's all of the above. The world came into Ocean Grove. Now I am so much of a traditionalist that I don't like that. But still, the world goes on, and so the problems of the world also came into Ocean Grove. Actually, they're beginning to leave now, which is kind of funny. I mean for a while Ocean Pathway used to be drunk haven, but it isn't anymore. That type of thing.    Ms. Newman: That was because of the institutionalization?    Ms. Nichols: Right. And when the price of housing went up, the whole flavor of Ocean Grove changed in a way because people were spending money on their houses instead of just living in them. I mean, many of the houses in Ocean Grove were ramshackle thirty years ago. There were very few houses that you would walk by and say, "Oh, isn't that beautiful." Today one is more beautiful than the other because people have finally been willing to spend money on their houses, and they're just making mansions out of them, and they're beautiful, beautiful homes. So that has made a huge change in Ocean Grove. I think the Historical Society has made a huge change in Ocean Grove because they've been very protective of our history. The Camp Meeting Association has not been. If it hadn't been for the Historical Society, practically all of our heritage probably would have been thrown in the trash. But the Historical Society saved everything, and they also gave us all a new sense of the historicity of Ocean Grove and the appreciation of the history and the need to preserve the traditions of Ocean Grove. I think the Beautification Committee has done an awful lot toward making people have more pride in the way Ocean Grove looks and people are buying into it. They have made the grounds of Ocean Grove absolutely spectacular. I think the whole thing possibly started with the restoration of the Auditorium, which was falling apart. And millions of dollars were spent on that restoration and then it kind of spread, almost like a pebble in a pond. People started fixing up. Now, I don't get the impression that people are in competition with one another, you know, "He did his house, so I've got to do mine better." I don't get that impression at all. I just get the impression that people are now taking great pride in their homes. I think an awful lot of people have bought their homes in Ocean Grove as their eventual retirement home, and so they're really doing a number on it, and that type of thing has changed quite a bit. It used to be that the homes in Ocean Grove were really just kind of summer shacks, and people came down for the summer, and then in the fall they'd close the front door and then they went home, but that's no longer true. Some of the houses in Ocean Grove are spectacular. They're on a par, I think with almost any other town.    Ms. Rakita: And I think that has spilled over to the tents. The large majority of the tents now are beautifully kept up. People have made wonderful interior improvements in the kitchens and the bathrooms. Painting, flowers, decoration, antiques. I mean it, there are thousands of dollars worth of antiques right in the tents. Old children's toys, kitchen equipment. Old kitchen equipment is very big now: wooden handled kitchen equipment, and oak furniture, gorgeous oak furniture, original wicker. So people are buying these lovely Victorians and fixing them up. People are also taking tremendous amount of pride in their tents. This was not true as I grew up. When I grew up, the tent was pretty much four cots, a bed, and a steamer trunk. There wasn't too much of interest. My mother was very unique in that she had lovely flowers in front of her tent  other people did not.    Ms. Newman: But now virtually all of the tents have them.    Ms. Rakita: Almost everybody has gorgeous flowers in front of their tents, if they don't they stick out like a sore thumb. Because there is this waiting list, people are keeping their tents for much longer periods of time.    Ms. Newman: Once you rent a tent, it is yours to keep until you relinquish it, right?    Ms. Nichols: Generally speaking, yes. If you do something awful, and we have had a few cases where some people have been thrown out of their tents for misconduct, but for the most part, once you get a tent, it's yours until you say you don't want it anymore. We've been in the same tent for seventy-one years. So that's a record. Actually we have been in tenting since the beginning. Our great-grandmother began the tradition, so we have a very long history of tenting. There is another family who has been in tenting a very long time who lives on Bath Avenue, but I can't remember the name. They haven't been in continuous residence, but they've been in tenting as long as we have.     Ms. Newman: Let me go back to that question I posed at first - is it like today as you pictured it when you were young, or have things evolved differently?    Ms. Rakita: Specifically, we've mentioned the things that changed in Ocean Grove. Most all have been, now in the year 2000, wonderful. They've been for the best. But as a young person, you don't look at yourself, or what's going to happen. I never would have guessed as a teenager that at age forty-two I would take a full-time job. I mean that was not something my mother did, and I never expected to do that. I expected that I would marry, have a family, and it never occurred to me that I would have an interest on my part of doing something else besides being a housewife. I could never have guessed that.    Ms. Newman: What kind of work did you do?    Ms. Rakita: I taught school, which I never expected that I would do. I don't think it's possible to say things turned out the way you thought they would, because there have been such enormous changes. I grew up in the industrial revolution, and then we had the communications revolution, and now we're into the next one. Everything's moved so fast.    Ms. Nichols: I grew up in a time when you had to wear your clothes to the beach, and go to the bathhouse in order to change into your bathing suit. That has been a huge change. You know, now you put your bathing suit on in your house and you walk down to the beach in your bathing suit. Forty years ago, if a man tried to walk through Ocean Grove with shorts on and no top, the police would have stopped him, taken him in, and told him to put on his top. I still go for that. I hate these big bellied men wearing only bathing trunks walking down Main Avenue in Ocean Grove. I think they look ugly and it's not respectful to the town. But on the other hand, it's kind of nice for the kids to be able to put their bathing suits on at the house and go to the beach instead of having to tramp all the way down, go to the locker, and go through that horrible tunnel to get on the beach. That type of thing.    Ms. Rakita: That's something that new people don't really appreciate. There still is a tunnel underneath the boardwalk. Now it's probably all filled up with sand, and I fully expect someday when somebody parks down there on the north end parking lot, the land is going to get wet, and their car is going to fall into the tunnel. But we had to take our towel and our suit and go into the bathhouse, change our clothes, and then we had a long flight of steps down, because this was a real tunnel. You weren't allowed to walk in your bathing suit across the boardwalk onto the beach. The bathhouse is here, and the ocean is there, and the boardwalk is there, so we built a tunnel underneath. This tunnel is dank and dark and wet, and it kind of always had a funny smell to it. It also had a curve, and I didn't like that. I was a little kid, and I went down the whole flight of stairs and I walked in the dark tunnel, and then got to the curve, and there was one place where you couldn't see until you went around, and then you could see the light at the other end. And then you would walk real fast and go up the steps again and then you were on the beach. But that's how strict it was. And it was the same thing at the south end. They had a tunnel too. You can't go across the boardwalk in your bathing suit. The only exception to that rule was when the bathhouses weren't open in early June and late September  you were allowed to put your bathing suit on and what we call a T-shirt, and walk to the beach. The beach has always cost a little something. Wasn't it five dollars during the Depression? Children didn't pay anything. It always cost fifteen cents to go to the pool.    Ms. Nichols: Eighteen cents. When I was working there it was eighteen cents.    Ms. Rakita: That was in addition to what you paid for the season bath house ticket of five dollars which was yours for the whole summer. You had a key, you could keep towels there, you could keep an extra suit there, you could keep the beach chair there. Some of them were double houses, and people kept a lot of stuff in double houses. But we had a house that was very nice because it was in the sunlight. It dried out. If it got wet or something, it dried out because the sun hit it. That was very nice. We got that house and we had that house for years.    Ms. Newman: Well, these are wonderful memories, thank you very much, I thank both of you very much.   
MonmouthCounty;Anna and Al Stuhl;1922;2000;Anna and Al Stuhl, 1922, 2000           Remembering The 20th Century: An Oral History of Monmouth County      Al and Anna Stuhl, June 2000  Date of Interview: March 27, 2000  Name of Interviewer: Flora Higgins  Premises of Interview: Monmouth County Library Headquarters, Manalapan, NJ  Birth dates of subjects: Anna Stuhl: April 10, 1924    Al Stuhl: May 28, 1922    Ms. Higgins: Good morning, Anna.    Ms. Stuhl: Good morning, Flora.    Ms. Higgins: Good morning, and thank you both for coming. How did you happen to get here in Monmouth County? How did your people get to Monmouth County? We'd like to know how you got here.    Ms. Stuhl: I married Al.    Ms. Higgins: How did you meet Al?    Ms. Stuhl: How did you come to Monmouth County?    Mr. Stuhl: That wasn't the question. First let me come to Monmouth County then we'll meet, that came later. I came in 1940 because my father decided that he'd like to have a poultry farm. I think his reasoning was that, having experienced the Russian Revolution to some extent, it's better to be on a farm then in a town. You eat better. I think that's the way he thought, but in any case he had decided that he was going to leave New York City because he had friends out here already. I was only seventeen, just graduated high school, and I ran the farm.    Ms. Higgins: What kind of a farm did you have?    Mr. Stuhl: We just had white leghorns mostly, and we did occasionally raise some broilers, but mostly it was leghorns. It was an egg farm, not a meat farm.    Ms. Higgins: Where was your major market?    Mr. Stuhl: The major market was probably New York, I would guess, because we had a feed co-op and an egg co-op.    Ms. Higgins: You bought feed and sold eggs?    Mr. Stuhl: Yes. Our eggs were distributed and they were picked up, processed, and distributed by the egg co-op.    Ms. Higgins: What town was this, Al?    Mr. Stuhl: We lived in Howell Township on Bennett Road next to Sam Bennett. He could've given you a long history.    Ms. Higgins: Was it successful? How long did you run the farm?      The Stuhl farm, 1945  Mr. Stuhl: I would say the farm was successful because in 1945 when I came home from the war, my father said, "The farm is paid off." We did it without selling eggs on the black market, too, which is what most farmers did. During the war there was a black market in food, and people were getting all sorts of things that they might not have been able to get by the rules.    Ms. Higgins: Did you need coupons for eggs?    Mr. Stuhl: No, I don't think so.    Ms. Higgins: Just money.    Mr. Stuhl: I enlisted in the army reserves in 1942. I was called up in March of 1943, or actually April 1st of 1943. So I spent about a little over thirty months in the army.    Ms. Higgins: Where did you see duty?    Mr. Stuhl: The Caribbean area. I got into the medics by accident, I guess, no will of mine. I thought I'd get into the Signal Corps because I had trained for it a little bit. But I got into the medics. The boat left New Orleans and headed straight for South America, and low and behold, we disembarked in Trinidad. So I got to see Trinidad, and there one day I was at an assembly and they called out my name and I became a medical lab technician. I went into training in Trinidad and that was my career as a soldier. Most of the time we spent on the island of Aruba.    Ms. Higgins: It was an oil town, right?    Mr. Stuhl: Definitely. It had the biggest refinery in the world. We had a small station hospital to serve the people who guarded the refinery and I guess there was some coast artillery there. I don't really know much about that.    Ms. Higgins: And then you went back to Howell to run this poultry farm?    Mr. Stuhl: What happened was in 1945, I asked for a transfer to Puerto Rico. I thought I would go to the University of Puerto Rico. Here I was sitting around, when I just wanted to go to school. Then I got a furlough and got married.    Ms. Higgins: So how did you meet?    Ms. Stuhl: His father and my father were cousins and his father and mother came to visit us in Quebec in 1941. We corresponded by mail after that visit.    Mr. Stuhl: I went to visit you in 1942 in Quebec.    Ms. Stuhl: When they came to visit they took pictures. One of them had a picture of me and he liked the picture so he came the following June to visit.    Mr. Stuhl: We started corresponding by mail.    Ms. Stuhl: It was a letter writing romance, which lasted about three years. When he came to visit, he wanted to get married, but I had just started college, and I was not getting married.    Ms. Higgins: Where did you live?    Ms. Stuhl: I lived in Quebec City, Canada.    Ms. Higgins: You went back and forth to Quebec with this romance?    Mr. Stuhl: Before I got called up, I went to visit her again. The first time I visited her was in 1942, and the second time was in 1943.    Ms. Stuhl: And in the fall he came up. It was the summer, actually, in 1942.    Mr. Stuhl: I came the summer of 1942, right.    Ms. Stuhl: He wanted to get married.    Mr. Stuhl: Two trips by bus. By bus and train.    Ms. Higgins: All those letters. Where were you in college? What were you studying?    Ms. Stuhl: I went to St. George, when it was a college. It is now Concordia University Montreal. I was studying chemistry and biology with a minor in English. I couldn't spell at that time, but I did very well in school. I was born in Romania. My family came to Canada in November of 1938. November 3rd, we landed in Quebec at night.    Ms. Higgins: What language did you speak?    Ms. Stuhl: At that point, I spoke Russian, Romanian, and French.    Ms. Higgins: French must have enabled you to function in Quebec.    Ms. Stuhl: We had been to Canada before. We had come in 1930  my father did not like it, and we went back to Europe. So I started school in Montreal. I went to first grade in Montreal. We lived in Montreal at that time. And then we went back to Europe in 1932.    Mr. Stuhl: Your mother was the hero who made the family leave a second time.    Ms. Stuhl: Yes, she insisted that we go. She did all the papers. My father was not very anxious to come, but she saw the war coming, and she was getting us out of there. So we came back to Canada in 1938. And my uncle, my father's brother, had a store in Quebec, a big store at the time. He gave my father a job and provided us with an apartment with enough groceries and canned goods that we had it through the whole war. We were never short of food. There was a closet underneath the staircase going upstairs, and that thing was full of food. He made it very nice for us. I cannot complain. And my aunt took me to school and she made me Anna. On my papers, it says Ann but she decided I would be called Annie and she was a Canadian born and she decided she liked Anna better so that's how I became Anna. It was different. I did high school in three years. Then I did a fourth year in Quebec because they started putting in what they called grade twelve, which was equivalent to first year college, and from there you went to second year college. Then I went to Montreal to go to college.    Ms. Higgins: Did you do anything with chemistry?    Ms. Stuhl: I worked at a paper mill one summer. That's about the only time I actually used my chemistry knowledge. After I had children, I thought of going back to school and doing something with chemistry. At first I thought I would become a Home Economics teacher because I liked that, too. I like cooking. I went to Georgian Court and I had a bachelors degree in chemistry and biology and they wanted me to start college all over again. So I said, "Forget it." And then I took an aptitude course in the night program. And they tested me and thought I'd come out good as a librarian. So I investigated going to library school, and I did. There Dean Martin encouraged me to go  he registered me right there and then. He registered me for fifteen credits the first semester. I started that first week, the second week I cut it down to nine.      The Stuhl family, 1955  Ms. Higgins: Now what year was this about?    Ms. Stuhl: I started in 1957.    Ms. Higgins: So you had been married and had children?    Ms. Stuhl: Yes, I had two children at the time.    Mr. Stuhl: She was the biggest graduate there.    Ms. Stuhl: I was nine months pregnant when I graduated. I had my third child in 1959, and graduated in 1959.    Ms. Higgins: Was Al still running the poultry farm at that time?    Ms. Stuhl: At that point, yes, but he was working off the farm. We still had chickens at the time.    Mr. Stuhl: The farm business had not been too good. We were paying price supports for grain, and eggs were not supported. I can't imagine how people make a living with eggs today at the prices they are. But any case I culled chickens, separating the good from the bad for about ten years, I guess from 1951 to 1961.    Ms. Stuhl: You went there when Dari was born.    Ms. Higgins: For a company?    Mr. Stuhl: For a company and then for myself.    Ms. Higgins: What company was it? The Monmouth County Company?    Mr. Stuhl: No. Ultra Life was the name of the company. And that company sold a feed additive to the co-op. When the co-op started to buy from this company in East St. Louis Illinois, they provided a service. They taught us how to do this thing called internal culling: palpating the organs of the birds.    Ms. Higgins: And you could tell which chickens were going to be producers?    Mr. Stuhl: Well, there's what you call inside characteristics and outside characteristics, and you combine them both. And you can detect if there were any problems with the chicken by exploring internally.    Ms. Higgins: And what happened to the chickens that didn't make the grade?    Mr. Stuhl: They went to the butcher. Basically it was done when people were going to keep birds over through a molt for the second laying season, which is no longer done today. So that business is all over. That would be good to select breeding chickens by using that technique. You could pick out things that you could not see externally.    Ms. Higgins: And during this time frame, say the mid 1940s to the late 1950s, you lived in Howell?    Mr. Stuhl: We lived in Howell until 1967.    Ms. Stuhl: Then we moved to Ocean Township.    Ms. Higgins: Why did you move to Ocean Township from Howell?    Ms. Stuhl: Well, at that time I was working.    Mr. Stuhl: We sold the farm.    Ms. Stuhl: We sold the farm, but I liked the school system in Ocean Township at that time. It was one of the better ones.    Mr. Stuhl: She decided to become a librarian. I decided to become an Industrial Arts teacher. We both took this night course at Red Bank High and we spoke to the guidance director who led us, very nice man, and we both got steered in the direction that we finally took.    Ms. Higgins: You taught Industrial Arts for a long time, didn't you?    Mr. Stuhl: Yes I taught for twenty-four years, but it wasn't all Industrial Arts because I ended up in the Essex County Youth House. And I taught in a classroom for about ten years. I was there for about twenty years.    Ms. Higgins: To juvenile delinquents?    Mr. Stuhl: Right. I used to commute to Newark.    Ms. Stuhl: Basically that's why I selected Ocean Township. They had one of the best schools going including Tinton Falls, Shrewsbury. That area had good schools, but Freehold did not impress me. Because I got around on the bookmobile, my first job in the library was going around to the various towns in Monmouth County with the bookmobile. I didn't drive. I just met somebody who says they remembered me from the bookmobile. "You used to drive that thing?" he said. I never drove it.  Don Price was the driver.    Ms. Higgins: There were not any of the branches then that there are now. There was only the library in Freehold. Tell us a little bit about the library when you started.    Mr. Stuhl: Before you start the library, let me tell my story. In 1940, I used to read in the New York Public Library and get my books from there in Manhattan and in Brooklyn. I lived in Brooklyn. So when I came out here I was interested in a library and I was informed that there was a branch at Ms. Foreman's house and she was on Howell Station Road. In her home she had a couple of bookcases with books and I could go there select books from there, and make requests, which she got for me. At that time, I was reading political economy, and she got me the books.    Ms. Higgins: Where did she get the books? From the State Library?    Ms. Stuhl: Monmouth County.    Ms. Higgins: Oh, through Freehold. Okay.    Ms. Stuhl: This was known as the station. By the time I started there were some. I still had a few stations, but mostly they were gone.     Mr. Stuhl: This was just a little library in the Foreman's house.    Ms. Stuhl: It wasn't even a library  there were people on porches.    Mr. Stuhl: A place where you could get books, and you had contact through the one on Main Street, right.    Ms. Stuhl: They had pick up and delivery.    Ms. Higgins: bookmobile pick up and delivery.    Mr. Stuhl: No, bookmobile came later.    Ms. Stuhl: They had bookmobile then, too.    Mr. Stuhl: Not too extensive.    Ms. Stuhl: But not for the public.  By the time I came, every little town had at least a station.      Monmouth County Library Bookmobile, 1966  Ms. Higgins: How frequently would the bookmobile visit a station?    Ms. Stuhl: At the beginning we used only one bookmobile.     Ms. Higgins: Who was director of the library when you came?    Ms. Stuhl: Julia Killian. She hired me. I can't remember statistics as such, but we did have what we called stations. In Ocean Township in the upstairs of the firehouse, there was one lady, Mrs. Levey, who took care of the books. And she sat there  she was basically a guardian of books. She didn't move, but she changed books. We used to go there at least every other month and then she could go on the bookmobile and select whatever books she wanted from the bookmobile. In addition, she could order. I don't quite remember how they sent in requests, but then we would search them through our facility and then they would go to the State Library if we didn't have them. And whatever we could we provided. We did not have as many duplicate copies as we did later so when we started, it was hard to get the best sellers. You got one book, and it had to do the library in Freehold, the old little house, whatever you want to call it, on Broad Street, and they also filled the shelves of the bookmobile so there was constantly a battle for new books.    Ms. Higgins: It sounds very familiar even today even though we do buy many duplicate copies, there's still the battle for the new books. Was best seller reading such a mania then as it is now?    Ms. Stuhl: Yes, always.    Mr. Stuhl: The Book of the Month Club was really big in those days.    Ms. Higgins: Oh, yes, and the Literary Guild. As you say, we can pick up the statistics in the books, but can you tell us a little something about the flavor of when you would pull up to this station? Would the public come on to the bookmobile and select?    Ms. Stuhl: No. Not there. Besides that we had a regular schedule with about thirty to forty stops in the different areas. I added many more because as I was doing this, all these developments started cropping up. And where there's a development, there are children, and they like to have a bookmobile around, and so it came to Manalapan for instance. One of the biggest users was Neptune Township when it was part of the county system. There were two stops that I remember.     Mr. Stuhl: But you used to go to Farmingdale Borough. The hook up there was really interesting.    Ms. Stuhl: And in Neptune Township, for instance, we had a bookmobile stop in Hamilton Gardens as it was called. It was a development. And in somewhere between two and a half hours, I would say, we used to circulate over 1,000 books. And there was only a driver and myself. It got so bad that I used to get help. Another driver would come and help us, because not only did you have to get the books out, you had to card the books that came in and put them back on the shelves, so that somebody else could have them. There were only 2,000 plus books on the bookmobile. It was an interesting job  I met lots and lots of people, and people still recognize me from so many years ago.    Ms. Higgins: Did the bookmobile travel up in the Bayshore or Middletown?    Ms. Stuhl: Not Middletown. There were libraries in Keansburg which we put in, actually, and we developed it, it was in the Borough Hall. Union Beach had a little library that somebody started, and its now much larger than it was. Hazlet had bookmobile stops. Holmdel didn't have bookmobile stops, but they did finally have a little library.    Ms. Higgins: Did you stop in the street?     Ms. Stuhl: Yes, on the street on the corner.    Mr. Stuhl: That's one of the reasons we moved to Wanamassa. She knew the area.    Ms. Stuhl: I knew the area. I knew Wanamassa  Oakhurst, Ocean, too. They didn't have any library at all except for this little library over the firehouse in Wanamassa, which didn't do much business, and was only open like four hours. Deal had a library also in Borough Hall. They'd give them a room that had shelves  we provided the books, and the lady opened it, I think one afternoon and one evening. I think Interlaken still has that very part time library in Borough Hall.    Ms. Higgins: How about Atlantic Highlands and Highlands?    Ms. Stuhl: There was a library in Atlantic Highlands. Highlands, I don't remember, I think we had a bookmobile in the Highlands for a little bit. But it did not work out.      The inside of the bookmobile, 1966  Ms. Higgins: So those bookmobiles are like a traveling ambassador for the library system, right?    Ms. Stuhl: Sort of.    Mr. Stuhl: It was very popular.    Ms. Higgins: Did people line up to get in?    Ms. Stuhl: Yes. They did a story on my bookmobile with Donald in the Asbury Park Press. The pictures of all these ladies with the carriages, adults and children came to the bookmobile.    Mr. Stuhl: Did Mary ever go on the bookmobile?    Ms. Stuhl: Mary Calleto, Rife her name is now. Now maybe she would come in and talk to you. You know where she lives? She lives in Kalamazoo, Michigan. But we do see her.    Mr. Stuhl: She comes here.    Ms. Stuhl: She hasn't been here in a long time.    Ms. Higgins: Were your functions at the library limited to the bookmobile?    Ms. Stuhl: At the beginning, yes, but the library was not so organized as it is now. I did cataloging. Catherine Mahar used to type the cards. I mean it was a very mom and pop operation compared to what it is now. Everybody did a little bit of everything.    Ms. Higgins: As the branches were built, did the bookmobile service stop?    Ms. Stuhl: Yes, and expanded elsewhere because Ocean Township was the first branch we had. The towns built the branches  we did not build buildings.    Ms. Higgins: Did they come to you for guidance when they built them?    Ms. Stuhl: Yes. And we worked with Ocean Township. I remember it was our first branch.    Ms. Higgins: That's pretty exciting.    Ms. Stuhl: Yes, it was very exciting. It was back in 1966 that it opened.    Ms. Higgins: When did the county start staffing the branches?    Ms. Stuhl: Right away. That was one of my ideas.  When I went to graduate school you had to do a thesis, and it had to be on the place where you worked so I did where I had volunteered. I don't know how many hours I spent here. And the library and I go through sort of my own critique of what they did, and what I think should be done. And I came to the conclusion that staffing the branches was the best thing to do, because you can do with less books, if you have the right person helping.    Ms. Higgins: So the whole extension system developed around this concept?    Ms. Stuhl: I became the extension librarian, and then I became the assistant director.    Ms. Higgins: Well, before we talk about your duties as assistant director, which I do want to get to, tell me something about the luncheons. The luncheons for the members. Members, of course, have a different political relationship with the county library.    Ms. Stuhl: Well, member libraries were the libraries that existed before the county really blossomed. County library came in to existence in 1924, I think  they didn't start working until 1925. So it was a different sort of attitude, you know, they were there first. And we didn't really trespass, but we provided additional services, and we kept thinking of what kind of services to do. And we developed all kinds. There was a time when we did displays for them, of course, and we did requests, that's an ongoing business. And then we provided them with new books. And through the years we gave them McNaughton, for instance, which was a rental type of thing. The county paid for it. The members got so many new books per month. They were all best sellers. And then they could buy them at a reduced price if they wanted to keep them, or send them back. That worked very well, and after a while our budget increased enough so we could buy the copies for them. We started appropriating budgets for each branch for books. The library still does this. Jack Livingstone was very, very insistent that they had to keep in the budget. I don't know how it is now.    Ms. Higgins: When did Monmouth County Library start providing children services?    Ms. Stuhl: Anoter service I keep thinking we started was a part time librarian doing children's service. I don't know what year.    Mr. Stuhl: Mary was one of your first ones.    Ms. Stuhl: Mary, yes. She never did branches though, she did outside summer reading story hours. She did story hours for the bookmobile for me.    Ms. Higgins: bookmobile provided story hours as well as books?    Ms. Stuhl: In the summer, yes. But only certain places where they would let us have a lawn. You couldn't do it on the bookmobile. You couldn't seat fifty to sixty kids on the floor in the bookmobile, they would be squashed. People were very nice. They were very happy to have the service, and when bookmobile came, Mary used to come. I have pictures of them sitting on the lawn in Yorktown in Manalapan. I'll never forget it.     Ms. Higgins: Because you didn't have a building?    Ms. Stuhl: Yes, there was no building. Once we started having buildings, and we saw how nice it was to have story hours, we started sending librarians out first to do just story hours, and then to work a day in the library, and be sort of in charge of children services, and that increased in some places where there was a children's librarian on duty all the time.    Ms. Higgins: One of the more appealing aspects of being a member librarian is that the county provides  both the books and children services. Of course now we're offering a wide variety of automated services, as well.    Ms. Stuhl: Yes, now we're doing a lot more with computers and the charging system. I mean I remember when we had to fight to get a Gaylord charging supplier for the members. We rented it. You didn't buy it  it wasn't that expensive, but at that time, it was a lot of money. When I came to the county library in 1959 the total budget was $90,000.    Mr. Stuhl: A librarian only made four to five thousand dollars.    Ms. Stuhl: Yes. $4,640 was my beginning salary.    Ms. Higgins: For a graduate.    Mr. Stuhl: A graduate, yes, with a master's degree.    Ms. Higgins: Was it full time work, Anna?    Ms. Stuhl: Full time at that time was four days nine to five and a half an extra day because we worked one night nine to nine.    Ms. Higgins: Even then the Monmouth County Library was open at night.    Ms. Stuhl: Friday nights usually in the beginning, and then when we got bigger, it became three nights a week, now it's five nights a week.    Ms. Higgins: You were the branch librarian in charge of the branches, weren't you?    Ms. Stuhl: Yes, the extension librarian was in charge of the branches.    Ms. Higgins: What was the second branch?    Ms. Stuhl: The second one actually was Allentown.    Ms. Higgins: How did that happened?    Ms. Stuhl: Because I think partially they were still in the old building but they got the chance to buy the church where they are now. At first it was one room in a house, before it was  in the church. It was small and crowded, and then they moved to the church. But they decided they wanted to be a branch, shortly after Ocean. Then we got Oceanport. They came in as a branch. And after that Wall, then Hazlet, and then Holmdel. And then I think Marlboro and Colts Neck.    Ms. Higgins: This was all during the 1960s and early 1970s. The members were contributing the tax dollars and getting services, and the branches were setting up.    Mr. Stuhl: What about Neptune?    Ms. Stuhl: Neptune didn't have a branch. Neptune pulled out.     Mr. Stuhl: And Belmar pulled out. And they're not part of the county system.    Ms. Stuhl: Neptune was a shame, because we did have a lot of bookmobile stops and a lot of usage. It was personality feud, probably. And Belmar definitely the same.    Ms. Higgins: This decision influences a lot of people, a lot of children, and a lot of adults, to this day.    Ms. Stuhl: I don't know if they were happy with it.    Ms. Higgins: So at this time was Headquarters in the old supermarket building?    Ms. Stuhl: No, before that the main library was on Broad Street, and then we had an annex on Marcy Street where we did the book processing and extension services.    Ms. Higgins: Two separate buildings.    Ms. Stuhl: It was a nuisance: it was a problem to coordinate.     Ms. Higgins: When did Mr. Livingstone become the director?    Ms. Stuhl: Eastern Branch opened in 1968. He came the year before, 1967.    Ms. Higgins: He put a lot of energy into developing the library with you.    Ms. Stuhl: Yes, he was a good businessman, and a good supervisor.    Ms. Higgins: And tell us about Eastern Branch. How did that get started? You were also a member of the Friends of the Monmouth County Library Association. Oh, before we leave the members, I brought it up before and reminded myself to go back to it. Talk to us a bit about the luncheons that you personally provided for the members.    Ms. Stuhl: One of the things that was a problem to me personally is that none of the librarians ever got to see each other  they just didn't know each other. You know you worked there, and I worked here: our paths didn't cross. And since most of the member librarians were not library school graduates, they didn't have this feeling of networking, if that's the word to use. And so I thought it would be nice to get them all together, and what better way then to make a luncheon and invite them all over? So every year before Christmas, I did that, and I used to cook it all by myself.    Ms. Higgins: What a labor of love! What would you serve, Anna?    Ms. Stuhl: The library is still my labor of love. He gets mad at me because I'm still a little involved with the Friends, and I still come here. I sold Friends Cookbooks at Barnes and Noble.    Ms. Higgins: How did that go?    Ms. Stuhl: They sold six books.    Mr. Stuhl: About those luncheons: she used to buy chickens.    Ms. Stuhl: The county paid for the food  I kept receipts and they paid for the food.    Mr. Stuhl: She served boneless chicken. We used to cut open the thighs.    Ms. Stuhl: He used to bone the chicken for me, that's why he remembers.    Mr. Stuhl: And she wraps them up. She made a complete dinner.    Ms. Higgins:  The member luncheons were so famous. Did you have any kind of bread with it?    Ms. Stuhl: I didn't bake bread in those days as much. I made rice. I may have baked bread, but I don't remember.    Ms. Higgins: What kitchen was this prepared in?    Mr. Stuhl: She cooked everything at home, and we'd bring it.    Ms. Stuhl: Jack Livingstone would pick me up in the morning with all these things to be all warmed up. I even had a rotisserie oven because I needed to heat some things. It worked out very well.    Ms. Higgins: Everyone had a great time.    Ms. Stuhl: Yes, and the member librarians got to know one other, which makes it much easier. You know if I think you may have something or you may know something, I call you because I know who you are. I have a face to connect to the name. It became much more personal. I think they still have the luncheons.    Ms. Higgins: Now they're catered. The members get gifts, as well.    Ms. Stuhl: Yes. Well, we would get calendars from the book distributor we were buying from. We'd give them out.    Ms. Higgins: Did you bring desserts as well?    Ms. Stuhl: Yes, cakes, sure.    Mr. Stuhl: That's the first thing she always does: get desserts.    Ms. Stuhl: I made a complete luncheon with some things before, and a main course. It was buffet style.    Ms. Higgins: And who set all the tables? How many people would you serve?    Ms. Stuhl: I don't know: anywhere between thirty to fifty people.    Ms. Higgins: That's a lot of chicken. Would they bring their staff?    Ms. Stuhl: Some of them would bring their staff, some didn't.    Ms. Higgins: Well, as I say, that luncheon is an ongoing institution.    Ms. Stuhl: It was a labor of love, there's no question about it. But they remember it. It did make an impact. It touched people, and I really feel good about that. It made such a difference. I would visit the member libraries and spend time trying to help them organize, trying to help them catalog, whatever jobs they needed help on. And you know when you could say, well, so and so in this other town is doing it that way, it wasn't  like criticizing them, because you're telling them something is being done differently. Then they listened because, they knew who the other person was: they had met at a member luncheon.    Ms. Higgins: Can you tell us about the energy of the Friends of the Monmouth County Library Association?    Ms. Stuhl: The Friends were very influential in getting Eastern Branch built. They did a lot of PR work, a lot of pushing, and so on. They went to Freeholder meetings. I was not that involved in it. I had children, so I was busy. I didn't run around to meetings at night too often if I didn't have to. And so I don't really know the inside story.    Mr. Stuhl: Tell Flora about how you used to bring in the branches to the county.    Ms. Stuhl: Oh, that was later, that was here. Not in this building, but in the other, the Grand Union, where I did have room.    Mr. Stuhl: She got a carpet downstairs.    Ms. Stuhl: I'm trying to think why we stopped going to the branches.    Ms. Higgins: Bookmobiles were in a state of disrepair at that point, weren't they?    Ms. Stuhl: And they were all building libraries, and they were busy, and they just didn't feel like it. It went on for quite a while, but we used to exchange collections at the members. But after a while it became a problem and they sometimes forget I called up one or two persons to come to here to pick books. We had this big extension collection sitting there, and we wanted the librarians to use it. It was in the basement under the Grand Union building.    Ms. Higgins: That was the genesis of the system whereby the branch librarians came to the extension collection.    Ms. Stuhl: They could come in whenever they wanted, and then I started setting up a schedule. I saved some carpet we took out at home and I brought it down there, because the basement was damp. Nobody really liked being in the basement too long, but the carpet made it a little more homey, and this space provided a place where we could put the new books before they were shelved in the general collection.    Ms. Higgins: Even with all your degrees in sciences and librarianship, it seems to me that your chief contribution has been a major, major public relations effort between the library and the public, library branches, and library members?    Ms. Stuhl: Yes, part of it. I'm very conscious of having to please the customer.    Ms. Higgins: Can you tell us about building the headquarters library here in Manalapan?    Ms. Stuhl: Well, I'll tell you first more about the Eastern Branch. We were sued.    Ms. Higgins: The County was sued?    Ms. Stuhl: Yes. They delayed building for I don't know how long because of the Freeholders and the exempt libraries. (The towns that had libraries that did not belong to the county were called exempt because they were exempt from the county library tax. Ed.) They felt that using general county funds to build the Eastern Branch library was not legal. In other words, they were paying for some of this. It took a long time and much litigation till that was resolved. Their residents can use the library, nobody stops them from using the library. They just can't borrow a book, but they're not paying for the books. This was the rationale. The rationale worked, and they went ahead, but then they hit clay or something that also made a problem with Eastern Branch building. It took a while to straighten that up. Eventually we moved into Eastern Branch and didn't close any libraries because their businesses dropped off. Eastern Branch took off by itself, and they added to it.    Ms. Higgins: Are we going to add to it again?    Ms. Stuhl: They are going to add to the meeting room because the meeting room is so small.    Mr. Stuhl: Yes. You know Jack started the jazz programs at the library. Anna was working at least two or three Sundays a month part of the year.    Ms. Stuhl: For all of the years that the jazz program was at Eastern Branch. This was volunteer work. We did not get paid for it, we did not get time off, nothing. It was just Morey Berger, Jack Livingstone, and myself who were there every week, every time they had the program.    Ms. Higgins: That's simply a remarkable contribution.    Ms. Stuhl: As I said, it's been my labor of love.    Ms. Higgins: By this time your children were how old?    Ms. Stuhl:  My youngest would've been eight or nine years old. The oldest would've been nineteen.    Mr. Stuhl: I used to go with you to the programs.    Ms. Stuhl: Not always but sometimes.    Mr. Stuhl: Almost always.    Ms. Higgins: Didn't they make coffee?    Ms. Stuhl: That's for jazz week. I used to make coffee and buy doughnuts. Between the jazz concert on Saturday night and the jazz sespers that we used to have, I served coffee.    Ms. Higgins: Again, another famous institution: jazz concerts.    Mr. Stuhl: We have friends living in our development now who used to come from Brooklyn to the jazz concerts.    Ms. Stuhl: They still come to all the concerts.    Ms. Higgins: Of course the price was right, too. Everything was free.    Ms. Stuhl: The price was right, and the people performing were well known to people in New York.  Better than here.    Mr. Stuhl: In those days, it took over an hour to get there from New York.    Ms. Stuhl: This Headquarters building was also built in part because of the pressure by the Friends. You have to give the Donowitz' credit because they used to go to the Freeholders meetings and they really pushed for a Western facility. We didn't have too many legal difficulties this time.    Mr. Stuhl: You got the land donated.    Ms. Stuhl: They tried to get Freehold Township to donate land.    Mr. Stuhl: There was a smart mayor in Manalapan.    Ms. Stuhl: And he came up with the land, so the Freeholders had to take it. So that's how this location came about.      Anna Stuhl at the groundbreaking ceremony, 1984  Mr. Stuhl: How could you turn down free land?    Ms. Higgins: It's a difficult site, but they seem to have worked around it.    Mr. Stuhl: It worked out nice. They had a good architect.    Ms. Stuhl: Well, we didn't think so all the time. But Jim Farady was nice to work with.  I was involved with the planning of this building. I retired in 1985 and they opened in 1986 here.    Ms. Higgins: Of course the library development in both Shrewsbury and Manalapan is the result of the tremendous population explosion in Monmouth County. Can you tell us something about how life was in Monmouth County in the 1940s and 1950s compared to how it is now? Like transportation: did you go to Red Bank much?    Ms. Stuhl: Not too much. We went to Asbury Park.    Mr. Stuhl: Shopping in Asbury Park, certainly, and not only Steinbachs. Asbury Park was just a lovely little town. And it's just something that happened all over the United States where all the little towns folded all over, except Red Bank.    Ms. Stuhl: Red Bank's probably the only town that remained.    Ms. Higgins: Freehold's doing all right.    Ms. Stuhl: Freehold's doing all right. But Freehold is the County Seat, so it attracts people from all over. The courts are here, there's business. We were living very close to Asbury.    Ms. Higgins: Did you go ocean bathing?    Ms. Stuhl: Not much. I'm not much of a sun worshipper. Once in a while.    Mr. Stuhl: I went to the YMCA in Asbury Park swimming and playing ball.    Ms. Higgins: Asbury Park had a good boardwalk.    Mr. Stuhl: Yes, we went on the boardwalk. I had lived in Brighton Beach as a kid, but I didn't go to the ocean very much, I went to the pool to swim and I played handball.    Ms. Higgins: How about your children?    Ms. Stuhl: They're all swimmers.    Mr. Stuhl: Well, they went to camp.    Ms. Stuhl: They went to camp. They went to Happy Time Day Camp, which I believe is still here down on Route 537.    Ms. Higgins: What kind of a camp was it?     Ms. Stuhl: They came and they picked them up. In Freehold, I think not at the house. This was all in Howell. When we moved to the shore, we were one mile from the ocean. They could bicycle when they were older. They all love it still. My oldest has a home down on Long Beach Island because she loves the ocean, and the other two come visit because they love the ocean.    Ms. Higgins: It's a good place to bring up children.    Ms. Stuhl: Oh, yes, the nice thing about the chicken farm is that the children knew their father. He was in and out of the house.  If he babysat he took the children into the coop with him. He put them on the conveyor, and the kids would sit on that and they rolled on through the chicken coop.    Mr. Stuhl: The older ones have a little memory of it.    Ms. Higgins: Sounds like fun.    Ms. Stuhl: Yes, well, I didn't like the chicken farm.    Mr. Stuhl: Coming from the city, to me, farming was great. You could do things you couldn't do in the city, and I wish I would've had more sense. I would've been gardening. In those days I didn't garden.    Ms. Stuhl: Now he gardens.    Ms. Higgins: Maybe you could tell us some recollections of George and Doris Handzo.    Ms. Stuhl: Yes, I miss them. I really do. I don't know how many times a day I think of them you know or something comes up and I say, "Doris used to say this or that." I met them because Colts Neck was talking of a library shortly when Julia Killian was still director, so shortly after I started working. We were invited by a family in Colts Neck. I can't remember the people's name who invited us. George and Doris were invited also, and Julia came, and we discussed the possibility of having a branch in Colts Neck. Doris wasn't a librarian yet. She was going to library school.    Mr. Stuhl: Was she teaching school?    Ms. Stuhl: No, she taught school before she got married. Doris' first job was actually at the Ocean Township Library. She was our first branch library director.    Ms. Higgins: Didn't the Ocean Township Library also launch Mrs. Field?    Ms. Stuhl: Yes.    Ms. Higgins: Our current assistant director.    Ms. Stuhl: Doris worked a bit at Wall, too. I worked all the branches, at least Saturdays. We rotated branch librarians. That's also my deed, because I thought they should know each others' collections. I mean it's worked for me. I don't try to interfere.     Ms. Higgins: So when did you first meet Doris Handzo? Back when they were down in Colts Neck?    Ms. Stuhl: In the early 1960s, I can't remember the exact year. But we did nothing about a branch. I put a bookmobile in Colts Neck at that point. We put in a bookmobile stop near school and another one near the reservoir, whatever that development was called, I forgot: maybe Phalanx. There were new developments in there.  And they worked  not as busy as some other places, but they're all rich people in Colts Neck so they go to Barnes and Noble. I was amazed to see so many people tour through the place and walk out the door.    Ms. Higgins: Did you say Doris became a librarian?    Ms. Stuhl: Doris somewhere in that point was either going to school at that time. I didn't discuss much. I did not know her well. But by the time she finished library school, we were opening up the Ocean Township Branch. I talked to her and she came in as director and she did a beautiful job. Through the course of the years, she became my friend. We were very close friends at the end. George became Mayor of Colts Neck  he had always been involved in politics and he was on the school board too, before I met him. And then he became interested in town administration.    Ms. Higgins: He was the Township Manager.    Ms. Stuhl: First he was mayor. Afterwards, when he retired, he became the Township Manager. And when he was Township Manager we got the library in Colts Neck.    Ms. Higgins: I think the Handzos, like the Stuhls, are just another example of the quiet people who have made such a tremendous impact in this county, and for the good. I think you should both feel very good about that.    Ms. Stuhl: Well Doris was very, very helpful. They were nice people and I'm still in touch with their children. If we go to Texas this next Fall as we planned, we will go look them up.    Ms. Higgins: I ask people some "what were you doing" questions, just to kind of put some pins into the 20th century. Let's start with FDR: Where you were when FDR died? and then Kennedy?    Ms. Stuhl: I was in Canada. I was not here. My grandmother was in the nursing home she was in a coma and it was pretty quiet and then all of a sudden this lady screamed, "Roosevelt died." And a patient, who was a younger woman who had jumped from a burning fire on the second floor, was paralyzed. But her head was all right. She was in the same nursing home. And she heard that on her radio, and of course that made an impact.  My grandmother died the day after.    Ms. Higgins: And then when Kennedy died?    Ms. Stuhl: When Kennedy died, I was substituting in the Howell Nursery School where my children were going.  It's down on Emmons Ave. and the mothers would take turns. I was there substituting being outdoors with young children in the yard, and the neighbor came over and told us about JFK.    Mr. Stuhl: I don't remember where I was when Roosevelt died. I do remember where I was when Pearl Harbor came.    Ms. Higgins: Where were you?    Mr. Stuhl: I was painting the chicken coop that Sunday morning, and I came in the house and they told me that the Japanese had bombed Pearl Harbor. I was teaching shop in Keyport when Kennedy was shot.    Ms. Higgins: Were the children aware of the magnitude of this?    Mr. Stuhl: No, I don't think so.    Ms. Stuhl: For Kennedy's funeral, I remember we went to our neighbors, the Bragars, and all the kids were there and sat and watched the whole thing.    Mr. Stuhl: Well, they did such a job on Kennedy's funeral with the train, you know, then in Washington with the ceremony, and the coffin, with the rifle, and the riderless horse.    Ms. Stuhl: And they had TV by then.    Ms. Higgins: Your lives have seen a lot of technology. You and I were talking about the television, because when you were growing up there was no television.    Ms. Stuhl: I didn't even have a telephone in Europe. I did have a telephone in Canada.    Ms. Higgins: No jet planes.    Ms. Stuhl: No planes. No, we came here by boat.    Ms. Higgins: And of course back and forth you went.    Ms. Stuhl: I crossed the Atlantic three times.    Ms. Higgins: God bless your mother. So, Al what would you say are some of the big things in technology that you can look back on in the 20th century?    Mr. Stuhl: Well, communications have made a big difference. Everything has its advantages and disadvantages, and as you get older, you get to see the disadvantages. To see the way Anna worked in the library, and to see the way it's done today. It's just too big to be personal. And more or less, the families are split up today because kids take jobs all over the country. There's opportunities all over. These are the big changes that I see in personal lives. Then communications and the fact that information is all over the place. In fact at my age-- I'm approaching seventy-eight--and I can see where there's a flood of information. I can't even keep up with it. I can't keep up with the reading I want to do. It's changed so much. I feel sorry for these native peoples and others who just try to retain their culture, which is so different from what we have today. And I say why don't they just decide that they have to give up a little bit and accommodate to the dominant culture, and still hold on to the culture. Those are the things that affect people today. We have everything on the Internet with the punch of a key or a mouse. There's a lot of advantages to it, and the other hand, there's disadvantages also. How will things balance out? I don't know. I'm waiting for someone to write a book explaining it to me.    Ms. Higgins: Well, we all have to find our place in this sea of information.    Mr. Stuhl: You have no choice. This is it. We finally got computers.    Ms. Stuhl:I'm learning to use computers.    Ms. Higgins: Tell us more details about the poultry farming years in Monmouth County.    Mr. Stuhl: Well, it seems that we had a very good market in the city of New York. I think most of our eggs from this area went to New York  possibly some other areas fed to Philadelphia. But basically, we couldn't probably supply the whole market. So there's no problem. There was room for so many farmers and everybody's eggs would be sold in New York, except people who had different routes. The really good thing about the farming is the way of life. We had cooperation. When we were small in the beginning we worked together on different tasks, such as vaccinating chickens, housing chickens, and I remember separating the baby chicks, things like that. We did it in a group. We'd get together, and it really was nice. When I came back from the army, people had expanded. You started having professional vaccinators, and people would have to hire help, it was more than just a family farm after a while. And being on the farm was nice: you raised your children.    Ms. Higgins: It was a good living.    Mr. Stuhl: It was a good way of life. But like everything else it couldn't last. Because things have to grow, and as things grow there have to be changes.    Ms. Higgins: I see a parallel with the library world and the farming world.    Mr. Stuhl: When people started with dairy farms, the family would work on the dairy farm and the kids would stay there. When the kids started moving out, you'd have to get help, and the next thing you know you were employing people.    Ms. Higgins: It was business.    Mr. Stuhl: And it was business, and you had to do it in the business way, and business has to grow. It doesn't stay still. And when it grows, it gets impersonal. That's the problem.    Ms. Higgins: What were your recollections of the Roosevelt years?    Mr. Stuhl: The NRA was Roosevelt's program to get us out of the Depression. I remember when people's furniture used to be put on the street if they couldn't pay the rent. I'll never forget that when it happened to a friend of ours. He and I just took a nice long walk on the Boardwalk to the Coney Island, stayed away for the whole day until the adults figured out where to put the furniture.    Ms. Higgins: This was in the 1930s.    Mr. Stuhl: This was the 1930s.    Ms. Higgins: Trying to pull out of the Depression.    Mr. Stuhl: Well, we pulled out of the Depression when the war started actually. Because in 1937 they had what they called the recession. It was a period when things were moving up slightly. Roosevelt was putting people to work with WPA, PWA, and the CCC. So people had something to do. That helped the economy a little bit, but then there was this recession in 1937 and then the war came around. By 1940, I'm sure military manufacturing became involved, I don't know.    Ms. Higgins: Eisner's right in Red Bank made military uniforms. It was a big influence in our county.    Mr. Stuhl: I remember when Roosevelt was packing the court, trying to pack the court, to get some of his things through, because he had a very conservative court, and they didn't want to make any changes. He was trying to get enough people on it so that he could get a majority vote and, of course, it was unconstitutional.    Ms. Higgins: Well, you were pretty young then to be aware of all that going on.    Mr. Stuhl: Well, I was about ten or twelve years old. I remember that.    Ms. Higgins: Do you remember anything about the Roosevelt town when it was built?    Mr. Stuhl: Roosevelt, New Jersey?    Ms. Higgins: Yes, our little town here in Monmouth County.    Mr. Stuhl: Yes, we've been there because Anna put a couple of little libraries there.    Ms. Stuhl: We had a station there, too. We had a library there.    Mr. Stuhl: And we saw there a mural by Ben Shahn. Nice little town. They're having problems today, though, just surviving.    Ms. Higgins: Maybe what your talking about here is another theme: trying to stay small is not always the solution.    Ms. Stuhl: But it's a different town now. It still retains some of the artists and people like that.    Mr. Stuhl: I forget what the problem was. It was in the paper recently that they are having a big financial problem, I guess.    Ms. Higgins: They are trying to maintain their own police force.    Ms. Stuhl: Which is hard to do. It's the same thing with libraries. They're not very much involved anymore, but they still do something with the library and are still considered a member. We used take the bookmobile out there every other week.    Ms. Higgins: Seems like if anyone in Monmouth County wanted a book, Monmouth County Library would get it to them one way or another.    Mr. Stuhl: Well, the way things are now, you can get books from anyplace. I mean libraries are all connected. It's amazing. So that's a really great advantage.    Ms. Higgins: Do you remember anything about the troubles at Fort Monmouth? Can you talk about that a little bit?    Mr. Stuhl: Yes. You're talking about the McCarthy era. I met a guy who was involved with the whole business, and I knew some people who became farmers. One lost his job, never went back. I know that not one case held. There was not one case where McCarthy succeeded in finding anybody in the left wing or anything.    Ms. Higgins: But there were a lot of lives really seriously interrupted.    Mr. Stuhl: Messed up a lot of people.    Ms. Higgins: Ira Katchen was the attorney for that. You weren't personally affected, but you knew people?    Mr. Stuhl: No, we were on the farm  we had nothing to do with it. I met some people afterwards who went through it.    Ms. Stuhl: Yes, every once in a while you meet somebody who remembers that.    Mr. Stuhl: Murray Miller never said anything about it, and I don't recall asking him.    Ms. Stuhl: Beth Miller's father was one of the commissioners here. He was on the Ocean Township library board. He was very influential getting Ocean Township to become a branch of the County Library.    Mr. Stuhl: Murray Miller.    Ms. Higgins: Murray Miller was at the fort?    Mr. Stuhl: Oh, yes.    Ms. Stuhl: He worked at the fort.    Ms. Higgins: As you look at the 21st century unrolling, even as we speak here, we're almost at the end of March, what would you like to tell to people who might be listening to this tape or reading the transcription in fifty or seventy-five years? You've lived a while, you've had some experiences! What would you like to pass on to them in terms of some advice?    Ms. Stuhl: I think all people are important and they should become considerate of one another and be tolerant.    Mr. Stuhl: They should appreciate diversity, and have a great measure of tolerance for diversity, and everything would be much better. The other thing, unfortunately, there's nothing much you can do about it, but when all the women started working, and you had help taking care of the children that's not family oriented. We are so far away from what has been done in Europe as far as taking care of families. We talk about families and we don't care a bit about them. Because if we did, we'd let people have flex hours so that they could raise their children, and there would be less pressure, because it takes two to make a living now, and I don't think that they are living that much better with two working than when one used to work.    Ms. Stuhl: It's very expensive to live now days. I can remember my kids when babysitting was fifty cents an hour and not always that much. Now it's five dollars an hour.    Mr. Stuhl: It was a quarter an hour when we started with kids.    Ms. Stuhl: It becomes a problem  you go out one night once in a blue moon and it costs a fortune for young people.    Mr. Stuhl: How do you go out when you have to pay five or six dollars an hour to go out? You spend fifteen or twenty dollars before you even turn around to eat or go to a movie, so you have to make a lot of money to afford that, and not everybody is making that kind of money. That's the biggest point that Robert Reich made. The former Secretary of Labor in the Clinton Administration, Robert Reich wrote in his book, " that spread between the rich and the poor is getting greater and that is a danger." And he tried to make Clinton aware of this. I don't think Clinton ever appreciated it, and I don't see anybody else on the scene who will do anything about it, and that is the problem that we are going to face in this century. We still have something like twenty percent of the kids below the poverty level. That's terrible in the richest country in the world.    Ms. Higgins: That's definitely a project for the 21st century along with increasing tolerance. Anna, would you add anything to that?    Ms. Stuhl: Well, I'm not so politically in touch.    Mr. Stuhl: That's not political, that's dealing with families. How are families doing?    Ms. Stuhl: Well, families have much worse problems now.    Mr. Stuhl: We've got single parent families in this country to the extent that we never had. In the worst period of the Depression, families stuck together. Now you've got I think maybe one-quarter to one-third of the kids are living with a single parent in a house.    Ms. Stuhl: That's one of the problems you're going to have to work at in the 21st century.    Ms. Higgins: Well, I really appreciate you being here this morning.    Mr. Stuhl: Oh, it was a pleasure.    Ms. Higgins: It was a real pleasure for me.    Mr. Stuhl: I'm sure I didn't think of everything I'd like to talk about.    Ms. Higgins: We never do, do we?             
MonmouthCounty;Ann Kofoed;1915;2000;Ann Kofoed, 1915, 2000        Kofoed1998.jpg (40593 bytes)    Ann Kofoed  Christmas 1998     Remembering The 20th Century: An Oral History of Monmouth County    Date of Interview: September 15, 2000  Name of Interviewer: Flora Higgins  Premises of Interview: Monmouth County Library, Manalapan, NJ  Birth Date of Subject: June 15, 1915    Ms. Higgins:  Please tell me about your hat shop.    Ms. Kofoed: Well, hats were always the love of my life. When I bought a hat I would always change it and put a feather in it and decorate it or something. I was working as a secretary, and the company I worked for moved to Connecticut.  I just decided I wanted something of my own. I was tired working for everybody else, so I told my husband I wanted to start a hat shop. At that time, this was back in the 1950s, hats were very popular.  My husband asked me did I want to go in by myself or could I get a partner, and I said I thought I could get partner.  I called my friend, and she said yes, she would do it with me. She was crazy about hats, too.  Her brother at the time worked for Bambergers with her sister-in-law.  They were both in the fashion end of it, so they were able to give us names of companies to go to, to get hats, bags, jewelry, gloves, and all the other accessories. So we went in to New York green as grass and we made our first purchase.  My friend had transferred her account from Newark to down here, and she gave them the wrong check, and the first check bounced!    Ms. Higgins: Were there other hat stores in this area?    kofoed1.jpg (66322 bytes)    An advertisement for the Lili-Ann Shoppe, the hat shoppe owned by Ann Kofoed and her friend and partner from 1953 to 1965.  (Note the phone number in the far right hand corner, not to mention the prices.)     Ms. Kofoed: There was none from Asbury Park to Perth Amboy.  Well, there was one milliner in Red Bank.    Ms. Higgins: Did you sell many hats?    Ms. Kofoed: The day before we opened we had to go to New York to buy more hats because all of our friends wanted to get the first pick.  We had one group who were buying them like crazy, and they'd say, "I bought two hats.  How many did you buy?"  Another would say, "I bought three hats."  It really was a riot.  We carried hats, gloves, hand bags, jewelry, and we made out like  bandits right off the bat.  It was fun.    Ms. Higgins: What was the name of your store?    Ms. Kofoed: The hat shop's name was The Lili-Ann Shoppe.  My partner was Lillian and I was Ann so we just combined the two names.  We did very well with just hats and accessories, handbags, jewelry, and gloves.  Then we expanded our because our customers would ask if we would carry blouses, so we did  then skirts.  Back in the 1950s slacks were just beginning to come into fashion, so we carried them too  eventually, dresses.  Then we were into the whole fashion world.  We were located right next to the Jersey Central Power and Light Company and the girls working there would come in every payday.  It lasted for twelve years, and it was really fun.    Ms. Higgins: Do you remember Joan and Ed White?    Ms. Kofoed: They're the ones who helped us get started with the hat shop.  Eddie was my partner's brother and Joan, her sister-in-law.  They both worked for Bamberger's in Newark, both into fashions.  When they saw our shop doing so well, they decided to open The Town Shoppe in Port Monmouth.  Joan passed away and now Eddie lives in Florida.  I still correspond with him.       Ms. Higgins:  Tell us about the Union Beach Library.    Ms. Kofoed:  We are very proud of our library  it is a great asset to the community and one to be admired.  It started in 1937 in a small cobbler's shop.  Three ladies had the desire to open a library.  They obtained the building and with the help of friends and neighbors they collected enough books to stock shelves.  Sixty-three years later we have a beautiful L-shaped building, staffed by a Director and two assistants.  Since 1990 a Calendar Committee was formed.  They have been producing a pictorial calendar which contains twelve 8x10 photos of historical sites and information of our borough since its beginning when it became a borough in 1925.  We hold three socials a year, "Down Memory Lane."  We invite all present and former residents to come and share their lives and pictures while living there.  The calendars bring back many past memories.  Our library is very active with new people joining every week.  Summertime is the "Summer Reading Groups," and winters pre-schoolers attend a reading and fun session twice a month.  They are allowed to select their own books from the shelves.  It gets them off to a good start.  We recently redecorated and painted and removed 20,000 books from the shelves in just one room.  So you see we do have a lot of reading material, with the gracious contributions from the Monmouth County Library.  We recently installed two computers in memory of our late Mayor, Carmen Stoppiello.  We also received donations of two more computers which have receive quite a bit of use daily.     Ms. Higgins: Did you grow up in Union Beach?     Ms. Kofoed: I was born in Newark, New Jersey, and went to school there until 1929 when we moved to Union Beach.  It was really a beach, then.  We used to come down here every summer for many years.  It was very rural, everyone knew everyone else and where they lived.  There was lots of empty space between houses, and sometimes "city" people would come down and pitch tents.  Some had wooden platforms with stairs.  Tents were erected on the platform.  It was like "Tent City."           Ms. Higgins: Was there swimming and boating and fishing?        Kofoed1920.jpg (24147 bytes)  Ann Callahan (Kofoed),1920    Ms. Kofoed: Swimming and playing on the beach was our pastime We'd go down to the beach after school and in the summertime.  That was our main playground.  We'd go in the morning and stay there most of the day, and we would have great fun down there all the time.  We would have relatives come down weekends and that was the first place they always headed down to the beach.   Of course we had to wait for the tide to come in to swim, but at low tide men would come down and dig clams right out of the mud for dinner.  There was fishing from the shore.  Some residents had boats, but not big ones, mostly row boats which were also used to catch another great delicacy which was plentiful then: crabs.  However all that is gone now, except a few crabs  are still being caught in our creeks.  There were lots of activities on the beach, like dancing. Every Saturday night there was a dance going on somewhere. Either the Fire Company had it, or somebody would be having a party or another organization called The Pleasure Club. Everybody belonged to that. It didn't matter whether you were a Republican, a Democrat, Catholic, or  Protestant.  Everybody joined The Pleasure Club.    Ms. Higgins: Was the beach equipped with a lifeguard?    Ms. Kofoed: Yes, we had two volunteer lifeguards who were high school boys. They learned to be lifeguards by taking life-saving instructions from the Red Cross in Red Bank.  One was William Hays and the other was Edward Levine.  They weren't paid by the borough.  They just did it on their own, and that was for several years.  Now everyone wants to be paid  there is no volunteerism anymore.  At present, we only have policemen patrolling the beachfront.  In time, lifeguards will be necessary, but I don't think many boys are interested in becoming lifeguards.  We recently had a beautiful beach reconstructed, and it is well occupied by beach lovers.  On the weekends though, there are no parking spaces.      Ms. Higgins: Is there any swimming there now?    Ms. Kofoed: Oh, yes.  We have loads of sand and lots of swimming, sitting, sunning, and everything down there.  We can thank our past mayor, Carmen Stoppiello, for that. He was the one who instituted this and it's absolutely beautiful.    Ms. Higgins: How big is Union Beach?    Ms. Kofoed:  Our borough is only 1.4 miles, from Keansburg to Keyport and Hazlet Township.  We are sort of off the beaten path along the Raritan Bay.  People using Route 36 ride by and don't realize we are another town along the Bay.  But it is a little private, and that is the way we like it.  I feel protected in a way.  We don't have all this bad publicity that other towns get.  It's not too overcrowded, although now, many new two story houses are popping up, bringing in new residents.         Ms. Higgins: Do you know how it got the name Union Beach?    Ms. Kofoed: Yes. Union Beach was settled in 1693.  Richard Poole was born in Union Beach in 1761.  The Poole family was one of the first.  Developers came and they purchased the land and they called it Union for a while, but then there was a Union up in Essex County.  So, as there was so much beach front, they called it Union Beach, and that's how they started the name.      Ms. Higgins: This may be one of those relatively economically depressed towns that is steadily coming back.      Ms. Kofoed: Oh, definitely.  It is on the upswing now.  New people are moving in everyday.  Our Police Force as well as our First Aid Squad and Fire Company are some of the finest in the state.   We do have our little incidents going on, but nothing our  police  force can't handle.  They're wonderful, but it's getting harder and harder to get volunteers to help our First Aid, Emergency, and Fire Departments because no one wants to volunteer.    Ms. Higgins: Yes, and your tax base is relatively small because the town is small.      Ms. Kofoed:  Everything we have is volunteer, and all the volunteers are wonderful. Our first aid and our emergency squads and our four fire companies have eleven mobile units between them, and they're very efficient and just wonderful.    Ms. Higgins: It sounds like the kind of town where everybody knows everybody else.    Ms. Kofoed: Years ago when the Bamberger's truck would come into the town they'd ask you where a certain street was, you'd say,  "Well, who are you looking for?"  And they would tell you the names.  " Oh, he's down two blocks and the third house."  You knew where everybody lived because there weren't many people living there. Now there are so many strangers, there's so many new people, and they don't seem to be getting as active in the organizations as we did. Maybe they're too busy  I don't know.  It's a new generation.      Ms. Higgins:  I think that's a pretty common phenomenon.  People are so hard-pressed for time now.      Ms. Kofoed:  They don't have time for volunteering  it's a dying process.  It's terrible really.  We are having the same problem up at the hospitals where there used to be ten or eleven auxiliaries, and now they're down to two, and eventually there's going to be none.    Ms. Higgins:  What did you do for amusement in the winter?    Ms. Kofoed: We would have basketball at the high school, and I was a cheerleader.  I stayed home and read a lot, too.  Radio was just beginning, so you stayed home and you listened to radio on the evenings.  That is when I learned to knit, crochet, and embroider.  We did a lot of singing  you could buy sheet music for a quarter and a song sheet for a dime, so we learned all the songs.  My family was a singing family, too.  We had parties and visited friends and neighbors and on weekends we usually had company, so we went to the beach and amusements at the Blue Bird Park, near our house.  We played Bingo and went to card parties.  I ice skated on Natco lake.        Ms. Higgins: Where did the Union Beach population go to high school?    Ms. Kofoed:  Most of the time to Keyport.  Union Beach was part of Middletown Township at one time.  We were all part of Middletown, and then they broke it up and turned it into Middletown Township and then Hazlet Township. Then our group decided they wanted to be a borough of their own and that's what happened in 1925.  They formed a Union Beach Improvement Association and got an agreement from the judges and the state and made their own town. Then it grew from there.    Ms. Higgins: Tell me about Sara B's Restaurant.    Ms. Kofoed:  Sarah Brunelli opened a family restaurant on Highway 36.  The building was owned formerly by a family named Scrober.  They opened it as a German restaurant on a two lane unpaved road back in the 1920s.  That part of the highway, known as Stone Road, which is still there, was the gateway to the sea shore before the highway  --or Route 36 -- was built.  You had to go through Keyport along the waterfront, which led you back onto the main road again.  We also had a trolley that used to run from South Amboy all the way along into town. The town had the trolley turntable and there are still parts of a trestle there, believe it or not. The trolley would go right on down to Sea Bright and Long Branch.  There was also a railroad there.       Ms. Higgins:  Could you get to Newark and/or New York that way?    Ms. Kofoed: The trolley started at Perth Amboy.  In order to get to New York or Newark, you had to change trolley cars at Perth Amboy.      Ms. Higgins: Is that the trolley that went down to Highlands?    Ms. Kofoed: Yes, the same one went all the way down until the railroad came along.  Then the railroad took you to Newark.  I worked at Prudential in Newark and I got the train right at my back door.      Ms. Higgins: You must have ridden on those charming little trolleys in Newark.    Ms. Kofoed: Yes. I loved the trolleys in the summer, it was open and cool.  Summers here in Union Beach, we rode them to Keyport to the movies.  Kofoedtrolley.jpg (167344 bytes)	"Open Trolley Car" heading into Union Beach from Keyport on the trestle built over the railroad tracks.  Trolleys ran east to the Highlands, others into Campbell's Junction South to Red Bank.     Ms. Higgins: As you were growing up, did most of the people who lived in Union Beach commute out of the borough to work?    Ms. Kofoed: Yes, most people who worked in Newark, New York, Kearney, commuted by train.  There weren't too many autos at that time either.  Most every working person commuted from the borough for work.      Ms. Higgins:  And today, do they still?    Ms. Kofoed:  Because there were so few jobs in the borough, most of the residents now travel to work by car, train, or bus.  Years ago we did have sewing plants, making men's jackets and ladies dresses, but there are none now.  McGregor was one of them.  Years ago many residents worked nearby on the farms, but now everyone travels away from home.       Ms. Higgins: Those were the days of the train with the coffee car in the morning and bar car at night.    Ms. Kofoed:  Yes, we spent a lot of time on trains,   We had lots of fun, especially on holidays when one fellow would bring his banjo and we would sing and have a wild old time!  Some people napped, some read or did needle work. It passed the time.  I knitted a whole dress and jacket one year.  Somebody got sick of seeing that dress.    Ms. Higgins: So you went to high school in Keyport and then you worked at Prudential and stayed on as a resident of Union Beach all those years?    Ann Kofoed    Ms. Kofoed: Yes.  I lived with my mother and father until 1942 and then I married and I moved around the other side of the Beach. We could have moved out of the Beach, but for some reason or another, we stayed. It was close to my husband's work. He was a boat builder in Keyport, and his family lived in Keyport  we were between the two families. I've never had any desire to move.  I never cared about going any further.  I was content where I was. I liked the town, I still do.    Ms. Higgins: What kind of architecture and houses do they have there mainly?    Ms. Kofoed:  It started as a summer resort, so you just had twenty-five foot lots and people would come down from the city and pitch tents. It was really tent city when it first started.  Then along came the Depression and the people moved down into these tents.  They couldn't afford their homes up in the city so they came down and moved into the tents, and that's when they were like bungalow type houses.  The town right now has so many new beautiful homes, mostly two story on 100 feet lots, or more.  It's wonderful to look out our windows and see all these houses instead of one floor bungalows.      Ms. Higgins: Was that legal to build houses so close?    Ms. Kofoed:  There was no law at that time. There were no building codes. It wasn't till many, many years later that they passed building codes. We still have many of these little cottages, but now they're putting upper floors on all of them or they're extending out.  Some bought the lot next door to them and they're extending out. The town right now has so many beautiful new homes, and they are all worth thousands of dollars.    Ms. Higgins: Do they have water views?    Ms. Kofoed: Not really.  Part of the borough is surrounded by water on two sides.  We have about three creeks and they aren't well because of ecology.  You're not allowed to build anything anymore, for all of the empty lots are being filled now.  There's senior homes being built near where the railroad was.  There were a lot of houses all along the railroad.  Now they've been sold, and they are going to have a big development going up right now.    Ms. Higgins: When you first came down to Union Beach, how did you find the quality of the water?    Ms. Kofoed:  We came down to Union Beach in 1929.   Our bay water was so clean  that residents dug clams right out of the Bay and crabs from our creeks.  But I don't think it is quite that clear today.  Our drinking water was the best. When our friends from the city came on weekends, the first thing they would do was drink a glass of our water.  It was so clean and cold because it came from an artisan well.  It dried up after many years and we now get water from the New Jersey Water Company.  Our bay, like all the others, was sort of not too pleasant to swim in for a while, but now is coming back to where it was.    Ms. Higgins: And they're probably getting better.    Ms. Kofoed: Oh yes, much, much better now.    Ms. Higgins: I think that's one good thing we have done in the 20th century:  we've reversed water pollution.    Ms. Kofoed: Definitely yes, and we're getting more conscious of it, and how scarce good water is.  We have to be more careful.    Ms. Higgins: Was there any talk of Union Beach being a site for water commuting?  Is there any plan like that?    Ms. Kofoed: Years ago Governor Driscoll was going to build a bridge from the point of Union Beach to New York, but it never happened.    Ms. Higgins: Well, that would pick up the traffic in town.    Ms. Kofoed:  We wouldn't be the littletown we are.  But the plan never developed.  For many years they talked about a ferry, but that never came to pass, either.    Ms. Higgins: The ferries have been pretty successful from the Highlands.    Ms. Kofoed: Yes, and they did run some boats out of Keyport.  But I don't think you'll ever see it out of our Beach.      Ms. Higgins:  Again, it's probably just as well.      Ms. Kofoed:  Right.  Like I say, we're out of the way and we can't have too much development. Now we have a huge sewer plant and that's enough along the water way for us.      Ms. Higgins: How do you envision Union Beach seventy years from now?    Ms. Kofoed:  Our town cannot expand too much because of the environmental programs.  There will be more lovely two-story homes built.  Right now a development is going up for adult homes  ten or more, and wherever there is an empty lot, a foundation is being built.  It will be a prettier town.  Older people are moving to senior apartments  I predict a younger group will be moving in, which will be good for development.  Again, I say it is a small town and will always remain that way.     Ms. Higgins: Pretty soon all the available land is going to be gone. There's a similar situation in Colts Neck.    Ms. Kofoed:  I don't really see too much development now, and I hope our beach front will still be there. I'd hate to see that gone again because it was just rebuilt a couple years ago when we had that bad storm in 1990 that washed it all away.  Now it is bigger and they have more protection for it.    Ms. Higgins: Were most of the original settlers of Union Beach Germans?    Ms. Kofoed: No, Polish. There were a lot of Polish settlements. One part of the town was all Scottish and they called it Scotland.  Another part of the Beach, along the beachfront, was Italian, so they were all segregated more or less. It's funny, but that's the way it was years ago, and a lot of those older families are gone now, but the children are still there.  Some of them have moved, but many of the families stay, like me.      Ms. Higgins: Where did you and your friends go for fun when you were growing up?    Ms. Kofoed:  After high school, we always went to Asbury Park to hear the big bands at the Casino.  We used to think Asbury Park was wonderful, driving down we'd go along the shore, and we just loved the shore.  My family used to go down to Sea Bright swimming all the time. We loved to go down the ocean, and that's what we seemed to enjoy  then we'd go up to Cliffwood.  There was another casino or dance hall up there. That was the main entertainment years ago, dancing, but we didn't drink in those days.  Asbury Park was a great place.  I hope it gets rebuilt soon.    Ms. Higgins:  Tell us more about your library.    Ms. Kofoed:  That started in 1963.    Ms. Higgins: That was a big time for libraries to go up because they received federal money.    Ms. Kofoed:  One lady wanted to get a library started. She found a little building which was a shoemaker shop, and she started the library there. She got friends and relatives to help her.  They all brought books, and then a building became available across the street.  The borough donated the property and everybody pitched in for material.  Carpenters came, masons came, painters, electricians, and everybody worked for free, and that's how she got the first building.  Eventually, they made a Health Center out of it for children, and they added another room in 1987, and in 1988 we added a fifty by sixty foot room.    Ms. Higgins: Now you're connected to the whole world with electronics, and many of your books are all part of the county system.    Ms. Kofoed:  Through the help of the Monmouth County Library system.  We are very proud of our library.    Ms. Higgins:  Was your husband a resident of Union Beach or did you meet him in Keyport?    Ms. Kofoed:  He lived in Keyport.  His father had a boat yard. They built boats and had a boat basin.  I went to school with him.  He didn't have to move too far from work. He only moved another mile or two.    Ms. Higgins: And then you commuted to Newark?    Ms. Kofoed: I worked at Prudential for five years till 1942, and then one of my friends asked me if  would come to Fort Monmouth, so I did.      Ms. Higgins:  You must of needed a car for that.    Ms. Kofoed: Oh yes, we had a car.  A Ford convertible. I picked up the girls everyday.    Ms. Higgins:  Can you describe how World War II had an influence on your life in Union Beach?    Ms. Kofoed:  During World War II, women made badges for the Red Cross, knitted scarves, gloves, hats for servicemen.  They built a watchtower down on the beachfront for watching any new ships or anything coming in. Everybody was involved in the blackouts.    Ms. Higgins:  With blankets over the windows?    Ms. Kofoed:  Oh, yes, yes. As a matter of fact, my husband and I were to be married and we were at the priest's house and we had a blackout, so we remember the blackouts well.  Everybody would help, and they all joined different organizations that were necessary: Red Cross, and everything else at the time.  We had Air Wardens who blew whistles and sirens for the blackouts.      Ms. Higgins: Of course, as you are on the water, planes were no idle threat.    Ms. Kofoed: No, that's right it wasn't. It's strange, but nobody has a picture of that  building on the watchtower.  We have pictures of everything else.        Ms. Higgins:  Of which building?    Ms. Kofoed:  The watch tower they had built, the wooden building on the beach front to watch for enemy boats and ships.      Ms. Higgins:  How was it manned?    Ms. Kofoed:  Everybody took turns watching  night watch, day watch, so forth.      Ms. Higgins: Do you remember any parades?    Ms. Kofoed:  We always had parades. They started in 1925 and we still have parades.  I think our American Legion has the reputation for the longest yearly Memorial Day parades. Every Memorial Day we have a parade and everybody gets into them.    	The First Memorial Day Parade, 1925, (then known as Decoration Day)  Mayor Charles E. Miller, leads the four-man police force down Union Avenue.  Ms. Higgins: We used to live in Highlands and I remember those parades.    Ms. Kofoed:  Next year we're going to have a parade bigger than ever for our seventy-fifth anniversary.     Ms. Higgins: Do you have any idea of any trends that might have been around in the 1950s?  For example, the government was looking for communists at Fort Monmouth.    Ms. Kofoed: I don't remember anything like that in our town. Not that I can remember.    Ms. Higgins:  Did the Civil Rights movement in the 1960s have any significant impact in Union Beach?    Ms. Kofoed:  I don't think so. Union Beach is quietly doing its own thing  as our mayor used to say, "This is the way we like it."  Nobody is bothering us. We do our own thing and we seem to get along very well.    Ms. Higgins: Do you have any grade schools there in Union Beach?    Ms. Kofoed:  Yes, we have a very good school.  We've always had a very marvelous school system.  I understand they're going to build several more rooms on to the school very shortly.  They are building seven more new rooms on to the present Memorial school.  It presently has over 1000 pupils and with the new homes going up, expect more.  We have always had a very good school system.  Our first school was built in 1915 and is still used to house the adult school, preschoolers, and Superintendents' Offices.       Ms. Higgins:  What is the population?    Ms. Kofoed:  A little over 6,000 now. With all the new homes and more children there are bigger families moving in now, so the population will be growing.      Ms. Higgins:  Can you tell me a little bit about the road project a few years ago?    Ms. Kofoed:  Most of our roads weren't paved when we first moved down here during the winter  we had terrific snow storms. All the neighbors dug out the streets to the main road.  They would help my father dig out to the main road so he could get his car out to go to work. Then the WPA built the sidewalks and the paving.  The WPA did very well in Union Beach.  Now the main roads are under the control of the county, so we take care of our own roads.  Some of the sidewalks the WPA built are still here.  There were  private farms in Union Beach.  There were egg farmers, vegetable farmers, and strawberry farmers in Union Beach.  They were all along where they built the new highway, Route 36.  The highway divides Union Beach and Hazlet, and that's where they had  to buy all the property down into Natco.  They were all private farms.  There was a Smith farm down in there.  All of the school kids would go to these farms and pick strawberries. They got  a nickel a basket.      Ms. Higgins:  Those kids had to have a way of earning a little money, too.    Ms. Kofoed: Our first ambulance, a used ambulance from Newark, cost $150 dollars.  Books were brought to town by the Monmouth County Library bookmobile.       Ms. Higgins:  What kind of bathing suits did you wear?    Ms. Kofoed:  Then they were all the one piece wool bathing suits, which were very proper and hot.  Wool,  they were all wool and they took all day to dry, but  they were also very stylish.  We used to have great fun down at the beach because after a storm all these big logs like telephone poles would float in from New York,  and we'd all swim out to get them, and we'd dive off them and roll each other over.  We always looked for big logs, it was lots of fun.  We always had a lot of fun.  My cousins came down weekends. I had four cousins who were older than I and they would come every weekend and one was greater than the other. They played the ukuleles, and we sang.     Miss Mari Ryan and Miss Anna Callahan (Kofoed) July 4, 1930  Miss Mari Ryan and Miss Anna Callahan (Kofoed) July 4, 1930  Ms. Higgins: Probably had a fire on the beach at night.    Ms. Kofoed: Oh yes. Even at our grammar school graduation.  The principle, Mr. Wells, gave us our party down at the beach. We had marshmallows and hot dogs and all that sort of thing.  It was great. Now you can't even light a match down there. You're not allowed anymore -- you dirty the beach and everything else.  Louis Sloan lived a block away from us.  He started out with a butcher shop.  There was another little building along side of it with a big veranda, and they put in a soda fountain, so that was quite a hang out for the kids.  We had a beautiful school too, Cottage Park, but it burned down.  Now they have a mobile unit for Cottage Park.    Ms. Higgins:  And almost all of these are within walking distance.      Ms. Kofoed:  Oh, definitely.  The town is only two miles square.  We walked all the time.      Ms. Higgins:  A safe environment.       Ms. Kofoed:  Yes.  And we've always been proud of our schools.  I belong to the Keyport High School Hall of Fame Association, and we nominate inductees every year, and many of them come from Union Beach. They've gone on to college and gone on to great things: one is a scientist, one is a maestro -- he's out in California  also an educator and a writer.  We've done some pretty nice things.    Ann Kofoed on her pony    Ms. Higgins: Tell me about your mother and father.    Ms. Kofoed:  Before we came down here from Newark during the Depression, my mother worked in Bambergers and my father had his own welding business.  Then my father came here and bought this house and he got a job in South Amboy with John Cross Welding.  My mother got involved with the different clubs, such as The Pleasure Club, and the ladies socials.  They'd have card parties at different lady's houses every week.  Then they formed the Democratic Club and the Republican Club.  And it was just sort of social.  My mother and I were involved with elections. She worked on the election boards, which I took over later.  I just seemed to follow in their footsteps.  I don't know why, but I do.  They were into many activities  my father became a Councilman.    Ms. Higgins:  Your parents got to Newark from where?    Ms. Kofoed:  Well, my mother was born in Newark.  I don't really know, but I'm sure she was born in Newark, and my father came from Orange, New Jersey.  His mother and father were from Ireland, and they were gone before I was born, and my mother's parents came from Germany.    Ms. Higgins: What was your maiden name?    Ms. Kofoed: Callahan. I never have any trouble spelling that name. Everybody has trouble with Kofoed.  When we were up in Newark, my father took me down to see the Memorial Day parades there, and now of course we had our own parades down here.      Ms. Higgins:  Although you left Newark at thirteen, do you have any memories of the Newark Public Library?    Ms. Kofoed:  Not really, I knew where it was, and I may have been there once or twice but it was quite a ways from where we lived.  We lived on what they call "the hill," and the library was way down the other end of Newark, so I never got to be involved with that.       Ms. Higgins:  Tell me about the tavern called The Blue Bird and The Black Hat Dance Hall.    Ms. Kofoed: Well, The Black Cat Dance Hall was a very naughty place. People drank, smoked, and danced.  We used to peek under the swinging doors to watch. The Pleasure Club started in the early 1930s or late 1920s.  Its meetings were held in the Blue Bird Inn, a tavern and hall in the Blue Bird Park Amusement Center on Union and Jersey Avenues.  Everyone in town belonged to it, Democrats, Republicans, Independents, all religions.  Everybody was friends, no politics.  They held dances, bus rides to Colts Neck, a picnic area, card parties, everything.  It was a real social club for everyone.  The Pleasure Club.  That is the most wonderful name for a club.  It sounds right out of Pinocchio, doesn't it?  And The Blue Bird had concession wheels.    Ms. Higgins:  Gambling?    Ms. Kofoed:  Not really, you would receive prizes instead of money.  They had a stand with hundreds of strings hanging from the ceiling with prizes attached to the other end, you would pull the string and receive the gift on the end.  There was another one in Highlands because my grandmother used to bring me home gifts on the nights she won.  Oh, I had so many little things from my grandmother who used to be down in Atlantic Highlands.  Oh, they had millions of strings.  They were run by Chinese and the gifts were all made in China.  They had a merry go round there.  There was one incident concerning a dog that lived down the street.  When they let him out, he heard the music, he would run away and go ride the merry go round, and everybody loved it.      Ms. Higgins:  Keansburg, of course had the rides.      Ann Kofoed:  My three girlfriends used to go there a lot, too.    Ms. Higgins: Nickels on Tuesdays. Did Union Beach have its own amusement as well?    Ms. Kofoed:  Yes, there was skee-ball along the avenue too until everything was moved to the beachfront.  Then that became the amusement center, with a merry go round, food stands, and games of chance.  We used to go down to walk on the boardwalk.  I haven't gotten there this summer, but I threaten to do it before the winter sets in.      Ms. Higgins:  So Union Beach had its own amusement as well.      Ms. Kofoed:  Yes, but  it's far from where it was.  They tore down all the stands.  Then they moved the merry go round down to the beachfront.  They moved all the concessions along the beachfront where all these stands were: the merry go round, and pinball, speedball, and all.    Ms. Higgins: And that washed away?    Ms. Kofoed: Yes.  That was all damaged in the 1950s.  And then where the library was originally they made a soda fountain, and a drug store out of that, and the  merry go round along side of that.    Ms. Higgins:  Is the merry go round still there?    Ms. Kofoed: No, no everything is all gone now.    Ms. Higgins:  We had a merry go round in Highlands, but it was destroyed by fire. It was very sad.  Do you have a business section in your town?    Ms. Kofoed:  We have no business area in our town as the creek divides our town.  There is "this side" and "that side."  Each section has stores and restaurants.  One section has two barbers, the other has three grocers and four restaurants.      Ms. Higgins: Is there any economic-socio distinction between one side of the creek and the other. Are there poor people on one side and wealthy people on the other?    Ms. Kofoed: No, it's nothing like that.  It's just that a business will start but it just can't continue, something happens, it falls apart.  We have two barbers and they're both across the street from each other. We had a butcher shop and then he moved down to the beachfront, now that store is empty.  Now he has a deli, but he just bought what used to be The Sandbar -- the original boat-house -- now they're along the beach. There's a couple of things down on the beach but they can't seem to settle on one side or another. Scorer's store was in the business section, but then there was also another store on the other side of the beach that was as popular. So it's always been divided. It's hard to put your finger on the business section.    Ms. Higgins: What's the best restaurant in town?    Ms. Kofoed:  We have two Italian gourmet restaurants.  Piero's, on Highway 36 and Cervino's on Union Avenue, in town.  Jake-A-Bob's, mostly a fish restaurant, is directly on the bay  the Colony Inn and Ader's both on Florence Avenue, each with great food.  We also have two wonderful delis that serve subs and sandwiches.  We are well endowed with eateries.      Ms. Higgins: Were snow storms much more severe in mid-century?    Ms. Kofoed:  We don't have it nearly as bad years ago when we would have to shovel out our whole street before we could get to the main street.    Ms. Higgins: How did you shovel that?    Ms. Kofoed: By hand. All the neighbors would come out and all the men would help you shovel out the street so you could go to work.  They saved all our coal ashes to put on the dirt roads.    Ms. Higgins: It sounds almost like a rural community.    Ms. Kofoed:  As I say, we were very happy.  The people are very nice. If anybody is in trouble or needs help, neighbors bend over backwards. A few years ago my house burned down.  I couldn't thank enough people that came and helped and offered their services.  It was just wonderful.  And if anybody is sick, really bad with cancer or bad problems, neighbors help.  They'll run all kinds of spaghetti suppers and Chinese auctions. They're the first ones to help every time. It's really wonderful the way everybody gets together when anybody needs any help.  It's a great little town.     Ms. Higgins: That's wonderful to hear, particularly in this year when we all seem disconnected.    Ms. Kofoed: Maybe it's because we're small. Maybe if we were bigger it wouldn't be that way, but we seem to be connected somehow or other when it comes to hardships.    Ms. Higgins:  I think maybe that the newer people will gradually become absorbed in the community.    Ms. Kofoed: I think so, yes. They come down to get away from all that togetherness up in the city, but it's a different togetherness down here.  Maybe they even didn't know who their neighbors were, whereas here, you'll learn who your neighbors are.    Ms. Higgins: What is the most significant thing that you would like to leave behind to succeeding generations?  As this archive becomes a part of the history of Monmouth County, what  would  you like to leave behind you to have people hear or read?       Ms. Kofoed: Well, I think Monmouth County is just wonderful.  No matter what you want, it's here. We have the Raritan Bay, not too many miles away, we have the ocean. Off to the right, we have all the mountains.  You come out here towards Freehold, you have farms galore. We have all the great hospitals.  We have a freedom here not found in big cities.     Ms. Higgins:  It must have been hard before Bayshore Hospital was built.    Ms. Kofoed:  Many years ago when I had to have my appendix out, I had to go all the way down to Long Branch Memorial, which is now Monmouth Medical.     Ms. Higgins: That's a long trip with an emergency.     Ms. Kofoed:  That's where you had to go.  The other one was South Amboy, but that was mostly for babies. Most people went there to have their babies.  Red Bank was very small at that time.     Ms. Higgins: Were you active in the Bayshore Hospital Association?      Ms. Kofoed:  I am still.  I am a past president, and now I'm just one of the members, but yes, I'm involved.      Ms. Higgins:  Is there anything you would like to advise to succeeding generations to save?    Ms. Kofoed: Well, I don't know what's happening with the new generation.  I don't know where all this badness is coming from or why. They seem to want to destruct instead of build, and I hope that passes soon.  I say I'm glad I'm on the end of this generation and a part of it, because I don't think I like what I see now.  I hope it changes for the better eventually because we will have nothing if it doesn't. It has to change.  We need to preserve. Of course, ecology-wise they're doing it, but there's other things that are falling apart, and you don't know where it starts. Does it start at home?  Does it start in the schools? Where does it start and where do you start cleaning it up?    Ms. Higgins:  What do you like to read?  Is there a book discussion group in Union Beach?      Ms. Kofoed:  No, they don't have a discussion group right now, but the library's very, very active, and we have not only school children  the adults too.      Ms. Higgins:  Especially now with the computer.      Ms. Kofoed:  Yes, and with the computer, more adults and students are coming in.    Ms. Higgins:  What do you personally like to read?      Ms. Kofoed:  To tell you the truth, I don't have much time to read.      Ms. Higgins:  What with one meeting and another meeting, you probably don't have a lot of time to read.    Ms. Kofoed: I like to look at historical things and pictures like that, and I really don't know that there is really one particular thing. I'm always aware of fashions. I always like to keep up with what's going on that way.  And I love my gardening      Ms. Higgins: Please tell me about the Plank Road.    Ms. Kofoed: Well, many years ago when the men of the borough formed a group, they bought all the property, and built a road into Keyport.  They built it out of wooden planks.  Now we have paved tar roads, but I'm sure if you go down far enough you'll find some planks down in there.  Then they built the houses along the road.  The house I live in goes back to 1856.  There's a few other old places around.  Our forefathers had a lot of foresight and dreamed of how Union Beach was going to be and I'm wondering if they see us now if they are proud of what they see.    Ms. Higgins:  Thank you so much, I have enjoyed this interview so much and I'm going to make it a point to come up to the Beach.    Ms. Kofoed: Thank you for having me.
MonmouthCounty;Albert Gibson;xxxx;2000;Albert Gibson, xxxx, 2000        Remembering The 20th Century: An Oral History of Monmouth County      Al Gibson on this sixty-fifth birthday, August 1997  Date of Interview: June 3, 2000  Name of Interviewer: Connie Paul  Premises of Interview: Ms. Paul's home,Freehold, NJ  Birthdate of Subject: not available    Ms. Paul: Al, you and I have known each other a long time. I think it was 1973 and I met you when you were the pastor of Hope Lutheran Church and I became a new member there. How did you get to Freehold in Monmouth County? Where did you come from?    Mr. Gibson: We got to Freehold in Monmouth County from Baltimore, Maryland, which happens to be my home town. I was born there and then had the opportunity to serve for a little over eight years as pastor of Christ Lutheran Church there. Then the American Lutheran Church, through the American Missions Department, called me to come to start a new congregation in Freehold Township. The response that I got from my spouse was, "Where in the world is that?" Well, we soon found out where it was, right off the Turnpike, Exit 8, and we were happy to make the first visit here and visit the house that was to become our home, which was at 266 Stonehurst Boulevard. Interestingly enough, it happened to be the first real estate sale of the person who has become very active in the community for a long period of time and that's Bob Cuneo, with Danis Realty. That was Mr. Cuneo's first real estate transaction after having been in sales for pharmaceuticals for many years. So, we've had a good acquaintance with Bob Cuneo, and his wife, Norma. We came to start a church. The building was not quite done when we arrived, but the site was in readiness and the building was under way, out on Adelphia Road, and I moved here with wife Lois and three children. For the first few months we were the church in the community. It was in the middle of July, 1966 when we came here, and we started our ministry by going from door to door, trying to find if there were any people who were vaguely interested in becoming part of a new Lutheran congregation.    Ms. Paul: Why did the American Lutheran Church (ALC) pick Freehold as a site for a missionary congregation?    Mr. Gibson: Well, they picked Freehold because a pastor in Neptune, New Jersey, kept driving through Freehold Township on the way to Fort Dix and noticed that there was a lot of growth going on here and that growth was on the Western side of the Township, and he thought that we ought to start a new congregation there.    Ms. Paul: And that was the Reverend Eugene Beutel.    Mr. Gibson: That was the Reverend Eugene Beutel, who had also been a pastor in Baltimore, Maryland when I first came into the ministry in 1958.    Ms. Paul: Why did you become a pastor? Is that a long question?    Mr. Gibson: That is a long question. I became a pastor because of my pastor in Willard, Ohio when I was at the age of confirmation, which was thirteen, fourteen years of age. He never asked me to become a pastor, but out of the sixteen members of that confirmation class, three of us became pastors. And it was just because he was a neat guy and was able to lead a congregation and lead young people into looking into opportunities for service through the church. He did say to me one time, not only to me, but to all of us, that when he was a kid, he grew up on a farm and he was the runt of the clan, and he got the opportunity to go out very early in the morning and milk the cows sitting on a three legged stool with a tail of the cow swishing him in the face. He said then that there had got to be something better in life than this.    Ms. Paul: So the ministry in the Lutheran Church was another option.    Mr. Gibson: Yes, that was one of them.    Ms. Paul: Okay, so you came to Freehold Township with your wife, Lois, and your children, Marti, Tom, and Steve, and you started knocking on doors.    Mr. Gibson: Correct, and we found not too much interest in the first couple of weeks of doing that. Prior to knocking on doors, we did try to acquaint ourselves with the community, so I tried to find where the Township offices were and they were in the Gables Building, at the time, down in the basement--a very obscure place, but none the less, they were there. I think Bob Farrell was the tax collector at the time, and so I met him and a few other folks.    Ms. Paul: There wasn't any other Protestant church in the Township at that time, was there?    Mr. Gibson: At that time, I don't know - the Assembly of God Church down on Georgia Road might have been there, but I'm not positive about that. But there was none in the Township, and there was no Catholic church at the time in the Township.    Ms. Paul: Most of the people in the area went to Freehold Borough where there were lots of churches.    Mr. Gibson: They went to the Freehold Borough area and of course, I think this is one of the reasons why the ALC wanted to start a church here. They thought that it was better to do it in a community where people are newly moving in-- that people would rather stay within that community than transport to another community--that they would prefer to start afresh.    Ms. Paul: So how long did it take you to get a group together and actually have a service?    Mr. Gibson: We began door-to-door canvassing about the first of August and we set a target for ourselves to have our first worship service on the last Sunday of September. And by that time we had made several contacts and there was some response. Part of that response was people saying yes they would be interested and they committed themselves at least to coming to the first worship service which was, I think, on the twenty-fifth of September, 1966. At that particular service, the building was not fully complete, but it was finished enough that we could utilize it. That was before certificates of occupancy were required for entrance into a building, and Jack Allen did not prohibit us from entering the building. He was the building code inspector at the time. So we had 150 people who showed up for the first worship service. Not all of them were interested, some were members of other congregations such as the Buscaglias and the Madges who gave good support to us.     Ms. Paul: They were neighbors on the property…    Mr. Gibson: They were neighbors of the property and became good friends of both Lois and me as members of the congregation and the Hope congregation on the whole. We were indebted to them for a number of things early on.    Ms. Paul: So what were some of the early ministries that the Hope congregation got involved in?    Mr. Gibson: Very early on we discovered that there were a lot of young people in the community, a lot of young people who did not become five years old before October first -- the cutoff date to enter the public school-- and therefore they had no opportunity for any preschool experience. So we looked at the possibility of starting a preschool the very first year that we were in existence--actually, in 1967. We started the Hope Christian School. We started with thirteen children, age four at the time, with one teacher whose name was Gloria Kropa. That progressed from one class of thirteen to eight classes of one hundred fifty-six, or seven three and four year olds.    Ms. Paul: So that been in existence well over thirty years.    Mr. Gibson: Yes. And that was a good experience because it gave us an outreach into the community to people who were not necessarily interested in the church but were interested in the children having some preschool education that was Christian oriented, and were willing to put their children in the school.    Ms. Paul: And of course there was the Sunday school program.    Mr. Gibson: And we had the Sunday school, which was for outreach as well, but primarily for the members of the families of the congregation. Early on, we started to think of ourselves as family and very rarely did we use the word "congregation." We used the word "family" because all of us were in need of brothers and sisters and children and grandchildren.    Ms. Paul: When I joined the church, one of the things I heard was that Hope had the reputation of being a "kissing" church.    Mr. Gibson: Well, yes, yes…kissing and hugging and I suspect that in all honesty it probably would be safe to say that I may have been the initiator of that. So, in retrospect, I've been told by others, and I have evaluated it myself, that was probably the most dangerous move that I made in terms of everything that's happening now in the end of the twentieth century and at the beginning of the twenty-first century. That hugging and kissing of anybody who comes in through the line on Sunday morning is maybe not the wisest thing to do, but you can't teach an old dog new tricks, so I still do it.    Ms. Paul: You mentioned that there wasn't a Roman Catholic Church then, but one was started soon after.    Mr. Gibson: The Catholic church in the area was in Freehold Borough and that was Saint Rose of Lima. That was a very, very large parish, and some time after we got started, the Bishop in Trenton decided it ought to be split to better serve the people on the western side of Freehold Township. The Bishop bought some property on Georgia Road, and called a pastor to serve that congregation. The pastor's name was Father Thomas Dentici, and he quickly became a friend of Pastor Al Gibson.    Ms. Paul: I heard a story that there were doughnuts involved in that friendship.    Mr. Gibson: Well, there was breakfast involved. Breakfast. And some of us had doughnuts, and some of us had other things, but we had the opportunity to meet together once a week for breakfast. We found breakfast a time that we were both available and it wasn't encroaching upon any other things that we were expected to do, so we did that for a couple of years. St. Robert Bellermine met for the first few years at the Elton Road School, that's what Erickson School was called at that time. They met in the gymnasium there, and I guess one of the first ecumenical events that we had together was when it came time in May for the first Holy Communion for the youngsters from Saint Roberts parish. Rather than have the service in the gymnasium at the Elton Road School, I offered them  the sanctuary at Hope Lutheran church for First Holy Communion.    Ms. Paul: Certainly when I grew up in Missouri, Catholics and Lutherans didn't have that kind of cordial relationship very often.    Mr. Gibson: Well, true, that was never part of my experience in any of the communities that I have lived in, including Baltimore where I served as a pastor. The friendship was not an edict from our superiors, but it was two clergy persons who liked each other and found that they had many, many things in common, including what they did as a vocation.    Ms. Paul: And so from that mutual respect, a more formal relationship developed, right?    Mr. Gibson: Yes. From that came the opportunity to formalize our relationship with an accord that was signed by both of the Bishops which had within it certain elements relative to the relationship about how we would try to get together socially, how we would do things in terms of worship and education, how we would do things in terms of social ministry in the community: activities we would do together.    Ms. Paul: A joint Vocation Bible School was one of them.    Mr. Gibson: A joint Vocation Bible School was the first thing that we did together. Because we had the facility (and even after their parish building was constructed they didn't necessarily have the facility for educational opportunity) we used our facility on Elton -Adelphia Road, and that was the first real ecumenical thing that came out of that. Then after that we had other things together, such as tennis parties and the exchange of pulpits a few times a year, the doing of joint Lenten services together-- sometimes in the sanctuary, sometimes we divided up among homes within the community. A program that I recall was called Ashes to Easter which we did within the homes of the community and the formal Accord was something that developed as a result of Tom's and my visits with each other on a regular basis. But in effect we had nothing to do with the Accord itself. We just thought it would be a good idea for a group of folk from each parish to get together and see what they could come up with and so we had a meeting with them, we shared our thoughts, and then we exited and never returned again until they came up with something.    Ms. Paul: I was on the church council at that time and I remember that process very well. It was a liberating thing for me because it was just exciting to get to know people of another faith and discover how much we had in common. I thought it was a wonderful program and a wonderful process that we went through.    Mr. Gibson: As we did that, the two of us, Tom and I, got involved in the Freehold clergy group. It was kind of a council-of-churches thing at the outset and it evolved into a clergy association in 1967-1968. That group included lay people who would meet together on a monthly basis, like a council of churches. And, of course, there was some interest at that time on the part of some within the group to work out something with the community so that night racing did not take place at the Freehold Raceway. A lot of effort, energy, and dollars were spent in trying to deter that. Indeed it never did happen. I don't know that we could say it was the result of what the council of churches did or not, I think it just didn't happen for many other reasons. But that took a whole lot out of the council of churches in terms of energy and finance, and so it was very difficult to get lay people together again. But the clergy felt the need to continue to do that, and so we did. We formed the clergy association that met on a monthly basis.    Ms. Paul: That group is still meeting, isn't it?    Mr. Gibson: That group is still meeting and I guess one of the neat things about it is that Father Dentici and Saint Rose of Lima participated, and then we had some participation from the Jewish community in the form of the Rabbi who started a new Jewish congregation, Shari Emeth, which is actually located in Manalapan. But the Rabbi lived in Freehold Township so that's another extension of our ecumenical outreach or togetherness in that I got to know Rabbi Phillip Schecter very well. And he got to know the rest of the clergy very well and ultimately he became Coordinator of the Freehold Clergy Council -- a position which I held  a couple of times during my tenure here in the community, also.    Ms. Paul: And the two of you became close personal friends over the years.    Mr. Gibson: We did, and remain close personal friends. We communicate by e-mail and the phone lines, which I happen to prefer, but none the less we do it both ways. And he is just retired -- I think that this past Friday. This is June 3, so that yesterday, the second of June, was his concluding service at the Shari Emeth Temple. He will be leaving the community in the not too distant future, this time following another rabbi, his wife, to Stamford, Connecticut, where she has a congregation that she has been called to. Early on it was a concern of mine that we find every way possible to serve the community, not just to serve ourselves as a congregation, and so the best way I could figure to do that was to get acquainted with the community. So I would make it a point to go to Township committee meetings and just find out what is going on with the community, what made up the community, who the power people were within the community, and to try to get acquainted with them.    Ms. Paul: You got involved with some of the community activities, also, didn't you?    Mr. Gibson: Yes, and one of the first things the growing community needed was to do something in the area of recreation. And that was right down my alley since I like to play, so, I got involved…    Ms. Paul: And you had some children who liked to play…    Mr. Gibson: Yes, children who liked to play, also. We got involved with the Recreation Commission which was a creation of the Township committee, and I ultimately ended up being chairman of that commission for a period of time.    Ms. Paul: What kinds of things did it do?    Mr. Gibson: Well, we instituted the opportunity for adults to become involved in recreation. There was adult basketball time set aside and we had to negotiate with the Board of Education, so I got acquainted with that piece of the community by doing those negotiations with Marshall Errickson, Superintendent of Schools, and got them to set aside schools and time within the schools to use for recreation for adults. Also for children, so that they could participate even though they may not have been on the high school or the middle school teams. But I guess early on one of the major things that ultimately proved to be most important in the Township was that we got involved with the utilization of the setting aside of green areas.    Ms. Paul: Green Acres?    Mr. Gibson: Green Acres areas. And so at that time, the area down on Georgia Road, which is now part of the Freehold Township Park System, was set aside, and we began to explore how that could be developed.    Ms. Paul: Is that Liberty Oak Park?    Mr. Gibson: That's Liberty Oak Park now, but even before that we set up a summer program so that there was recreation provided. It was like a summer camp that would take place in the morning, and it was fully supervised and, as a matter of fact, the former athletic director of Freehold Township High School was the first director of that summer camp program. Bernie Goldwater. So I had the privilege of hiring Bernie Goldwater for that job. And then other areas were set aside throughout the Township, and we began to meet with people who were in the business of developing parks and recreation areas. Before all that took place, I went off that Recreation Commission and went on to something else that I never thought I'd be involved in, and that was the Planning Board of Freehold Township. I found that to be very interesting work as you looked at the proposals of people who wanted to come in and begin developments and all that you had to do for site planning and zoning. It was a whole new arena for me in terms of my experience, and I wondered the whole time I was there why in the world the mayor would appoint a clergyperson to be on the Planning Board. But I found it to be fascinating, and I was told by members of the Planning Board that I did make a contribution because I had a different view, a different vision of things. …    Ms. Paul: When did you get involved with the hospital?      Lisa Lancaster, (far left) chaplain at CentraState  Tom Litz, CEO at CentraState  Al Gibson  Claire Morris, Council President of the Hope Lutheran Church    Mr. Gibson: Well, I got involved with the hospital as soon as there was a hospital, but even before that, when the hospital was still an idea and when it was just a cornfield over there on Rt. 537. They were doing fundraisers for the hospital, and I went to some of the fundraisers because I wanted to see that there would be a hospital there-- mainly because I had early on the need to be hospitalized. I had an accident out on Adelphia Road: I totaled my Oldsmobile on a tree that still stands in front of the existing High School. I did not get rid of the tree and I guess it's a memorial to me that it's still there. But I had to be transported over to the Jersey Shore Hospital by the First Aid Squad of Freehold Township and my good friend Charlie Buscaglia was the driver of the wagon that took me to the hospital. But I, along with a lot of other people, thought it would be nice to have a hospital right in this community, and so I wanted to participate in that and I did. And then I was pleased when the hospital was built and I got involved then with clergy visits to the hospital. At first I was doing that alone, but then having a greater concern for the total population of the hospital, particularly after it expanded to the number of beds that they currently have, about two hundred and forty, I guess, I tried to set up a chaplainry program through the clergy association in the Township of Freehold area. And the consequence of that was that we did do that, and Ron Van de Bunte of the Reformed Church was very helpful in coordinating that. We tried to utilize all the clergypersons, Roman Catholic, Protestant, and the Jewish rabbis, in providing pastoral care for the patients in the hospital. So we were involved with that for a long time, and then I think I said something to the effect that the hospital was constantly coming to the churches and asking the churches through their membership and as a whole, to participate in the fundraising and the gathering of funds for the hospital. I said, "Well, you always ask us for money-- maybe it would be good if we could have some representation on the board." So I was asked to be on the board.    Ms. Paul: Do you remember when that was?    Mr. Gibson: I think it was 1980. I'd been in the community for fourteen years already, so I was on the board then for twelve years.    Ms. Paul: And you ended up as Chairman of the Board.      Groundbreaking at Applewood Estates, 1989.   Left to right: Robert McLean and Dr. Kenneth Posner (CentraState Board Members), Al Gibson, and Jack DeCerce  Mr. Gibson: I ended going through the chairs, so to speak, of serving in the position of  chair, of every one of the committees that they have and also each one of the vice-chair positions, and then ultimately ended up as Chairman of the Board. And right during that time we expanded, so it was not just the Board of Freehold Area Hospital, which became CentraState Medical Center, but it was a board for the whole CentraState Healthcare System, which includes the nursing home, the Manor, and Applewood Estates, as well as the medical center, and some outreach places too that we have.    Ms. Paul: And I know that one of the things you were happiest about accomplishing then was the chaplainry program, wasn't it?    Mr. Gibson: Well, we had that in mind early on when we did chaplainry as a volunteer program and I made that a goal of my position as Chairman of the Board. If I didn't accomplish anything else during that term I would accomplish that, and so indeed we were able to do that. We had the proposal before the Board several times. I think this should be part of the record that I was not able to convince the Board that that was the right thing to do at that time, but it took someone like Rabbi Phil Schecter to be the convincer of the group. He allayed a lot of fears that people had that there would be a lot of proselytizing going on through the chaplain's office. Once those fears were laid aside, they called a chaplain and that was Lisa Lancaster. She was the first and is the current chaplain at the hospital, so we were pleased with that, and it continues to be a very vital program.    Ms. Paul: Another area of social ministry that you got involved in from the beginning was Open Door, was that right?    Mr. Gibson: Yes, and Open Door came about as a result of all of the churches being bombarded with requests for funding, for food, for shelter, and paying of gas and electric bills, and for all kinds of social needs. We were solicited as individual congregations, and so we started to think that maybe it would be good if we could put something together so that we could say to the people, "These are the resources that we have, this is the place that you can go, and we will be collectively supportive of that place." And so Open Door was what we called it. I think the finalization of that came about as the result of a meeting that was held at the cemetery of Old Tennent Presbyterian Church. On a very, very sunny, hot Saturday morning, we met there and put the final touches on it, and we were able to get a facility through Saint Peter's Episcopal Church -- they owned the building on Throckmorton Street and we were able to utilize that building as the site for Open Door. So then it was a matter of keeping open the door which we said we would do, manning it with volunteers who would distribute food, clothing, and early on, helped with other bills that people had.    Ms. Paul: Eventually it expanded to a tutoring program?    Mr. Gibson: It expanded into a tutoring program. Another thing I think that grew out of it eventually was another ministry that we got involved with at Hope. There was a prison over at the camp at Marlboro which is located right behind the state hospital. Persons were incarcerated there, but they were there without any educational opportunities available to them. So through members of Hope Lutheran Church, we provided some educational opportunities for them. We did that for a couple of years, and that drew attention to what they were missing in that regard, and so the state ultimately put a trailer there so we had classroom space even before we finished with the project, and then they took over the program and they provided the people.    Ms. Paul: Was that the late 1960s, early 1970s?    Mr. Gibson: It was the late 1960s, early 1970s, yes. And we even had opportunity at that point to utilize some talent within the prison camp in the form of some of the fellows who got together and did some singing and called themselves The Convictions. They were paroled for a night into my custody, and they came to Hope and sang for a wine and cheese tasting party that we had.    Ms. Paul: Didn't you have a special relationship with one of the prisoners there?    Mr. Gibson: Well, I think all of us had a special relationship with those we encountered, with those that we were teaching or counseling with, and my role was in the role of counseling. I did some group counseling while we were there. I was not an educator per se. We had other folks who were educators who taught specific areas such as English, mathematics, and language and worked with the prisoners in that regard. But we all had our favorites, and some of them kept in touch after they were paroled as well. So we thought that was a good ministry. And the best part of the ministry was the fact that the state recognized their responsibility and took it over and spent the money that had been duly allotted for that program, so we were catalysts for something taking place.    Ms. Paul: How long were you the Pastor of Hope Lutheran Church?    Mr. Gibson: How long was I Pastor? Forever. Forever, it seems, because I was the first and only pastor up until November 2 of 1997, so I was Pastor at Hope Lutheran Church for thirty-one years.    Ms. Paul: And at that point you retired.    Mr. Gibson: At that point I retired and with many good thoughts, many good memories, and many good feelings--but also with the need to move out of this community into a new community for us so that we could start out afresh so that I would not be tapped, verbally, or in any other way, to render an opinion or offer a suggestion.    Ms. Paul: Or stay involved.    Mr. Gibson: Or stay involved in things which were history and which needed to move on, and which new people needed to be involved in.      Lois Gibson, Al's wife  Ms. Paul: Your wife, Lois, had been a kindergarten teacher in the Freehold Township schools for how long?    Mr. Gibson: Lois was a kindergarten teacher in the Township for twenty eight years. That came about as a result of our registering our kids for school. Midge Erickson took the registration of the kids and found out that Lois had been a schoolteacher previously and said, "We need school teachers very badly, and can I put you on the substitute list?" And the substitute list became a permanent list. It was after our youngest, Stephen, was in kindergarten, that Lois was able to teach full time.    Ms. Paul: So where are you living now?     Mr. Gibson: We're living in Fayetteville, Pennsylvania. It is not Fayetteville, North Carolina although people keep asking us if we live in North Carolina when we say Fayetteville. It is Fayetteville, Pennsylvania, and it is a relatively new community. It is a golf community, Penn National, where there are two golf courses, two very fine four-star golf courses that I am still trying to conquer -- not with a great deal of success.    Ms. Paul: And where President Clinton comes to play.    Mr. Gibson: In the three years we've been there at Thanksgiving, President William Clinton has been at our golf courses playing. I followed him around the first year  the second year we were able to get his autograph. This year I'm going to write to him and tell him that it is his final year to play as President, and I would deem it a great honor if I could play with him. So whether that happens or not I don't know -- I know all of my Republican friends in Freehold Township will love to know that I may be playing golf with Bill Clinton.    Ms. Paul: And you're still preaching part time?    Mr. Gibson: I am still preaching part time, yes. If my spouse, Lois, had her way, she would have me preaching full time, but it is right now on a part time basis. She finds that even on a part time basis it tends to get in the way of other things that we would like to do. But I have limited the doing of that for the most part to the congregation in which we are members. In Pennsylvania there are hundreds of Lutheran churches  most of them in the area where we are living are very, very small. I preached in one just before Thanksgiving. Its date of birth was 1715. It is still operating as a small congregation -- the building does not date back to 1715, but the congregation does. The building dates back to 1863, and they are still worshipping in that building. It was fun to be there with them and share in a little bit of that history.    Ms. Paul: Well, I was part of your retirement celebration when three hundred people gathered as witness to the impact that you made in your ministry here both in the church and in the community. I wanted to get on the record some of the impact that you've had here and express the joy that I've had in knowing you and being associated with you all these years.    Mr. Gibson: Thank you. We enjoyed Freehold Township and we enjoyed the people, the people in the church, the people in the community. It was fun for me to be a part of it, to be a part of its history, particularly to participate in the big three-hundredth anniversary of Freehold Township and to parade in the rain portraying myself as Martin Luther in very wet garb. It's been a fun experience, and we relish the relationships that we have both in the congregation and in the community, and we will not forget them.    Ms. Paul: Thank you very much.     
MonmouthCounty;Ada Bryan;1908;1999;Ada Bryan, 1908, 1999        Remembering the 20th Century: An Oral History of Monmouth County    Ada Bryan  Ada Bryan    Date of Interview: October 17, 1999  Name of Interviewer: June West  Premises of Interview: Ada Bryan's home, Asbury Park, NJ   Birthdate of Subject: January 12, 1908   Deceased: April 10, 2003    Ms. West: Were you born here in New Jersey?    Ms. Bryan: I was born in North Jersey in Maplewood.  There were four of us, and then my youngest sister was born in Asbury Park once we moved here.            Ms. West: Do you recall in what year you moved here to Asbury Park?    Ms. Bryan:  It had to be around 1921 or 1922.  Our family visited the shore frequently before moving to Asbury Park.  Excursions ran from Newark to Long Branch, and my parents availed themselves of this service.  During this time, my mother met a lady on the beach in Long Branch who lived in Asbury Park, and a friendship evolved.  She told my parents about the town of Asbury Park, and what a nice place it was.  When my parents decided to move to the shore they chose Asbury Park because of all the good things their friend had told them about the area.  It was a snowy night in February when we moved.  Our possessions were back in the house where we once lived, because the weather was so bad and the movers would not go back to pick them up.  We also had a big disappointment  we thought we were going to live near the beach.  When we arrived in Asbury Park, we found out that the realtor had someone else living in the house we were supposed to live in, so we had nowhere to go.  My mother's friend knew a family that owned several houses in Asbury Park and they rented one of their houses to my parents.  The realtor did not inform my parents that people of color were not allowed to live near the water unless they were live-in domestics.                    Ms. West:  You mentioned that some of the youngsters who came up from the South were college students. So if they were able to get employment here, why couldn't the young fellows who were on the street corner get employment in the hotels?    Ms. Bryan:  All of the young boys and girls who were coming up from the South were getting free board and lodging in the hotel, so, when the thirtieth of May would come around, they were assured a job for the rest of the summer, and that is how they made their tuition to go back to school.  Well naturally, they would have to be paid more money.  They would leave Labor Day or a few days later, and the young boys who lived in Asbury Park couldn't live there like that.  Their lifestyle was so different.  Here you had to have warm clothes.  You had to buy fuel for the people for their homes.  There were bitter cold winters back in those days.  Well naturally, they would have to be paid more money. It happened to me one time. I saw an ad in the paper for a nursemaid to care for a child, and I called the telephone number. This place was in Long Branch, I think.  Domestic employment was just about the only kind of job that people of color could get at that time. Men in some places could be waiters, but most of the waiters, waitresses, and chambermaids in the hotels were all white. One particular hotel in Asbury Park would not hire anyone of color except as the cleaning people, and that particular place is still standing, but the tradition that they used to have has changed now. I know I used to have friends of color who worked there, but they didn't know it. I had friends that were of color, but the people who hired them did not know that. So, that is how I know what goes on.  When they came back home, they would tell what was going on in the hotel.    Ms. West: What is your most prominent memory of Monmouth County?    Ms. Bryan:  When we went to the beach on afternoons or whenever, and you wanted you could go up to the stands where they were serving hot dogs, hamburgers, and all the other things on the boardwalk, and you were not waited on. I used to go up and stand for ten minutes or more at a time. We would ask, "A hot dog, please... May I have an ice cream cone, please," and the workers ignored you.    Ms. West: Are you saying that you had to bring your own food when you went to the beach?    Ms. Bryan: Well, yes. My mother always had a picnic basket, and we ate our food on the sand.  We'd only want ice cream or soda, and there was a man of color, who had a stand where all the people of color went to get ice cream cones. Anything we wanted he had. But you were not welcome to go up and down the boardwalk and just walk in and buy hot dogs or ice cream.    Ms. West: Besides the social climate, is there anything else that stands out in your mind as far as the county is concerned?    Ms. Bryan: Well, you were not hired for jobs that were paying well. My father happened to make a good living for us because he had contracts to paint the outsides of three hotels in the summertime and he did the inside of the hotels during the winter months when they were closed.    Ms. West: So, the only area in Monmouth County where you lived, or are the most familiar with, is Asbury Park?    Ms. Bryan: Well, yes.  My father had a car, but he couldn't drive it. He'd always have to hire someone to drive him to visit friends or go other places...I never tried to attempt to have a job other than in Asbury or Neptune.    Ms. West:  Do you remember anything about World War I?    Ms. Bryan: Oh yes, I can remember how frightened we were because we thought my father would have to go off to war, and well we just didn't know what to do about that. We were so frightened all the time. And, of course, he was not accepted to go to war, and we were relieved of that. Soon after that, when we moved to Asbury Park, we felt a whole lot better because he didn't have to go off to war and he and mother, was working.  My mother used to be a cook.  We didn't know the word "caterer" then, but that's what she was. People would call her up and say they were going to have a dinner party and what have you, and was she available for such and such a date, and my mother would say yes. That would happen. Also, we lost a sister, my oldest sister passed away before we moved to Asbury Park. My mother had a beautiful flower garden, and my sister was out getting flowers, picking flowers one day when something bit her on her finger and she probably didn't tell that day.  The next day her fingers began to swell. We took her to Orange. That is where there was a hospital, but something happened and poison set in.    Ms. West: So she died as a result of the insect bite?    Ms. Bryan: Yes, she did. She was very young. Yes, she did.    Ms. West: Okay, going back to history, you were living down here in Monmouth County during the Depression. By this time, you had already moved here. How did you fare during the Depression?    Ms. Bryan: Well, it wasn't so good.  My father worked all during the Depression, but he probably wasn't making the amount of money that other people made, doing the same thing.    Ms. West: He was employed throughout the Depression?    Ms. Bryan: Yes, he was. I think that was about when I started working in a dress shop.  In the summer of 1969, when they had the riots in Asbury Park, the dress shop was damaged.      Ms. West: Are there any people here in Monmouth County who had an influence upon you?    Ms. Bryan: Oh, I would say yes.  My mother knew people who were interested in politics  they had formed a civic organization that my mother and my sister were both in. That made them very interested in what was going on, and they never missed a meeting.     Ms. West: Did you all have a political preference, party wise?    Ms. Bryan: Yes, we did. We grew up Democrats.  My father and grandfather who were not treated right, had been Republicans, so they became Democrats. Today I am a Democrat who has worked in the Democrat organization for over thirty-five years. I think I was quite young when it was time for voting, and you would walk the streets and knock on the doors and say, "Are you ready to go vote?" and would insist that the person walk with you back to the poll. Of course, you don't do that today. When they stopped doing that, I began to work at the polls, and did so for many years until my eyesight began to fail.      Ms. West:  Did you go to school in Monmouth County?    Ms. Bryan: No, I didn't go back to school.  I only attended school in Maplewood, where I went to the eighth grade.  I did not graduate.  I saw these boys with high educations not getting decent jobs. The one thing I will never forget in my life is when my father said, "When does school start?" And, I said, "I'm not going back to school," and he said, "Why?" And I said, "All those guys out there on the avenue all are college graduates. They have no jobs. I'm not going back to school. I have a job. I work in a dress shop, and I make a nice salary for me."    Ms. West: Well even though you didn't go back to school, did you like to read or keep yourself in school?    Ms. Bryan: Of course. I have always been informed. I always could read. I could just do anything that I wanted to do about, and my father said one thing I will never forget. With tears in his eyes, he said, "Ada, go to school and get an education and you will do better!"  I said, "Oh, no I won't. These people will not hire me. I am not going to go to school. I am already working. I am not going back to school."  That was wrong. I realized that.    Ms. West: What type of literature did you prefer to read?    Ms. Bryan: Any kind.  But I did not read what my mother called silly books like the "true stories" or those kinds of things.    Ms. West: Do you read novels?    Ms. Bryan: I read about things, and I do it to this day. I'm ninety-one.  When I turn my television on, it is the Discovery Channel.  I listen to lectures. Those are the things that I like, not the silly things of life.    Ms. West: Did you have any heroes or heroines?    Ms. Bryan: I have Colin Powell, I have Martin Luther King Jr., oh, yes, and all of the people who are not with us today who have tried to do something great in life.  I would read all about Harriet Tubman, Sojournor Truth, Booker T. Washington, Dr. George Carver, and Madam Walker.  Those were the people that I would read about.  I can't read anymore, but I talk about them with my friends.  My father tried to tell me about these people.  He said that I would be able to have a job and do as well as they did, but I didn't listen. I really didn't, and now I am sorry because I am quite sure that if I had listened, I would have been able to do great things in this world.    Ms. West:  Do you know anything about your ancestors?    Ms. Bryan:  My grandfather on my father's side who lived with us told us all about the bad things of the South. That is how I learned. He told me to keep them in mind. I have no malice or hatred or anything. Thank God, I grew up without that.    Ms. West: Well, how old was your grandfather?    Ms. Bryan: Oh, my grandfather was probably in his eighties when he passed away.    Ms. West: Was he a slave?    Ms. Bryan: Oh,  no he wasn't.  I am sure his father and his father before and so on were.  And that is how I learned all about the South.    Ms. West: What state in the South was he from?     Ms. Bryan: I think my grandfather was born in Virginia.  My mother was also born in Virginia.  My mother died at eighty-two.    Ms. West:  When you were growing up do you recall any prominent newspaper stories?         Ms. Bryan:  There would be headlines of people committing suicide because of the Depression. I remember when Wall Street went down. I was listening to the radio because it had just passed.  I know when the German airship Hindenberg crashed just seconds before landing.    Ms. West: Do you recall what town that was?    Ms. Bryan: That was over Lakehurst. Just as it was ready to be pulled down and when the ropes were being dropped for them on the ground, I think that is the way it came down, and all at once it burst into flames.  I can still hear the reporter's voice in my ear. He was so, so upset. Everybody in my house was crying. Anytime a disaster hits, it hurts all of us, not just the people in the disaster.  I remember some of the very bad things that happened with Charles Lindbergh's baby who was kidnapped.  Those were  big headlines in the paper. I still look at it on television when it comes on and I remember the man who did the kidnapping: Bruno Hauptmann.  I also remember when Lindbergh flew to Paris, (Laughs) and that was a big thing in our lives.  We were glued, we were really glued to the radio. And I remember my father bought our first radio. I think you called it a little crystal whatever it was, and we all sat around the table and he put it on. My mother had a glass bowl and he put the radio in the glass bowl and that made the sound louder. We were absolutely stunned when we heard Kate Smith sing America The Beautiful.  Oh boy, we thought that was great... It was.  I saw my first television program at the World's Fair.  You were escorted into a little room that would hold maybe fifty or more people and then, he turned the box on, which became the television, and the picture was being broadcasted a few doors away.  We thought that was pretty wonderful.  In fact, the very next day, I went back with my girlfriend, so we could see it all over again.    Ms. West: Do you recall the symbols at that particular World's Fair?    Ms. Bryan:  Perisphere and Trylon.  I stared at that almost half the day.    Ms. West: What else do you recall?    Ms. Bryan:  I think it was the first time I was on moving steps. I saw the World Tomorrow which still fascinates me when I see cars going to the left, the right, the west, the south. I still can't get over that.     Ms. West:  What games did you play as a child?    Ms. Bryan:  Hide and seek,hopscotch, jacks. I had a disappointment in a little game that I played. I think when I was twelve years old, I was playing a little game, and they were fixing a sewage or water pipe, and I fell in and didn't tell my mother for two or three days, and I think that is why to this very day I can hardly walk.    Ms. West: Did you have any hobbies?    Ms. Bryan: I liked ice skating in the winter and I could play some tennis where I lived there at the country club which, of course, we didn't belong to.  In the afternoons some of the youngsters would say, "Come on, let's play tennis," and of course, I did. And in the wintertime, I ice skated. But when I moved to Asbury Park, it was sleigh riding. There was a place where there was a pretty big hill called Sand Hill, and all the kids at the school in the early evening would go up on the hill and come down with their sleighs.  I liked being out in the cold and I would sleigh ride and come home so cold my mother would have to unbutton my coat, that is how cold I was.    Ms. West: What would you say has been your greatest achievement in life?      Ada Bryan and family on her 89th birthday    Ms. Bryan: I think after I was married for maybe three years or so, one day my husband and I talked it over my  and said, "Why don't we adopt a child?" And I think of getting my Lorraine, who is now taking care of me. I don't know what I would do without her. I think that was my greatest achievement. I also think that as long as my mother and my father were alive, they were taken care of by my sister, myself, and my brother. I also say the life I lived while I was married  I was in church every week. I worked very, very hard in my church doing anything that was asked of me.  I think that was the joy of my life.  Now I can't get to church. Some of my members come and give me communion every Sunday, every Sunday.    Ms. West:  In what way is your life different than how you thought it would be?    Ms. Bryan:  Well, I didn't expect to be here at this age.  I worked on the job for twenty some years and when I went to work, a person said, after a couple of days, "We are going to get along fine. So will you bring me your Social Security Card because we have to pay taxes?"  I said, "Oh no.. I'll never live to be sixty-five years old."  She said, "Ada, bring it anyhow," and I did take it, and here I am at almost ninety-two.     Ms. West:  Is there anything else that you think you would like to do?    Ms. Bryan:  I've been to Europe for two weeks. I went to Rome. I've been to the Vatican.  My priest, Father Gunning, who is still alive today, took nearly twenty-eight of us for two weeks.  We went to many places and he was able to explain a lot and be our guide because he had lived there.  We were also welcomed by the Pope and we were able to have an audience with him.  This was in 1972.    Ms. West: Well, I just want to thank you so much, Mrs. Bryan, for giving me the time to hear some of your stories, so thank you again. It has been my pleasure.    Ms. Bryan:  It has been so nice talking to you, thank you.   
MonmouthCounty;Peggy Goodrich;1921;1999;Peggy Goodrich, 1921, 1999          Remembering The 20th Century: An Oral History of Monmouth County      Peggy Goodrich at the Navesink House, 1999  Date of Interview: April 12, 2000  Name of Interviewer: Ms. June West  Premises of Interview: Mrs. Goodrich's home, Red Bank, NJ  Birthdate of Subject: June 5, 1921     Mrs. Goodrich: Hi. I am Peggy Goodrich. My legal name is Margaret Taintor Goodrich. I was born in Elizabeth, New Jersey in 1921. My mother and father were Archie Raymond Taintor and Vera Day Taintor. Mother was a teacher, and Dad was President of the Taintor Manufacturing Company that made saw sets and framing tools invented by his father. I graduated from Battin High School in 1938, which was the only girls' public high school in New Jersey at that time. I went on to Brown University, but the War was coming on, and I decided I didn't want to stay in college with the five-year program that I was planning on, so I went in 1940 to Katherine Gibbs School in New York City, and graduated from there. My first job was in New York City.    I became engaged to Robert Rhoades Goodrich, who lived in Hillside, New Jersey in 1941. We were married in November of 1942. He was in the Service, and I was now working in Elizabeth in Thomas & Betz Company, and we were in the War Industry. At that time, we were making parts for airplanes, and I was an expediter of parts there. Let me see now…we'll go on and think of things that happened after that. We had a year in Chicago before Bob went overseas. And that was one of our best years together, even though it was a scary year because we were worrying about the War and when he would go overseas, which he did. And he went to England, but he came back in December 1945. At that time I was the Executive Secretary to Mr. Goerke and Mr. Steinbach. Of course the Monmouth County people know Steinbach Department Store Company, and Goerke's was in Elizabeth. Then we had three children. We had Robert Jr. in 1948, James in 1951, and my daughter Ruth in 1954. We lived awhile in Cranford. From Elizabeth we went to Cranford, where we had a two-family house. We couldn't afford more at that time, and the houses were more expensive there. My parents had the property in Shark River Hills in Neptune since 1925, and they gave it to us. So we decided to build a home there. And we moved to Shark River Hills, Neptune in 1955.    I lived in Neptune thirty-five years. My husband passed away seventeen years ago, and I miss him terribly. We were married forty years. He was very involved in the Township. He was on the Planning Board, the Sewage Authority, etc. And I was a homemaker for awhile with the three children. Shark River Hills was more rural then. We had dirt roads and wooden street signs. But the kids loved it because they had a lot of places to play there. They went swimming in the Shark River, and fishing in the Shark River was great. And they enjoyed growing up in Neptune.      Peggy Goodrich (left) presenting Ocean Grove President George Hergesheimer with a homemade cake on Ocean Grove's 105th birthday, July 31, 1974.  I became very active as a volunteer at that time. I was involved in the PTA, the library, and the hospital  and I was president of these organizations. I was very instrumental in getting our little library on Corlies Avenue in Neptune to become a larger library, and then into the Municipal Complex when they built it in 1971. At that time, I was also a history buff. My father and my grandfather were history buffs, as well. I was very involved with the Township with the Tercentenary, the National Bicentennial, and the Centennial of Neptune. Because of that, I became a volunteer. I was the founder of the Neptune Historical Museum, and the first curator of it. It was on the second floor of the Neptune Library on Springdale Avenue at that time. Then the name of the road was changed to Neptune Boulevard. I would interview people and get things from their houses, and did different things. It was so popular with all the tourists and residents, that they decided to give me a full-time position after I had volunteered there for a year. I also was a reporter for the Ocean Grove and Neptune Times for many years. I did a lot of interviewing of local people about the history of the area. I really enjoyed it. I enjoyed people, and I enjoyed the children, particularly the tourists and pioneer Neptune residents. I was very involved with the school system, as well. I was on the Board of Education and on the Monmouth County Heritage Committee, and many other volunteer organizations. I was also on the Neptune Architectural Review Board, which viewed houses in Ocean Grove and Neptune to keep them historic. I was one of the prime movers for getting Ocean Grove to become a Historic District, and in 1975 it was put on the New Jersey list. And in 1976, it was put on the National list. I worked for the Museum for sixteen years, and really loved every bit of it. I saw a lot of change from when I first moved to Neptune in Shark River Hills. We had a lot of laurel and huckleberry bushes, and it was a summer bungalow community at that time. Of course now, it is a year-round community and an integral part of Neptune.    Ms. West: You mentioned it was known as a summer area?    Mrs. Goodrich: Yes.    Ms. West: Was the home that your parents had in Shark River Hills a summer home for your family?    Mrs. Goodrich: It was property that they owned from 1925. But we built our summer Cape Cod bungalow there in 1955. And then we added onto it when we decided to live there full time.    Ms. West: But it was just property that they owned?    Mrs. Goodrich: Just property they owned that they gave to us. My children went through the Neptune School system, and they all went to college. As I said, I was on the Board of Education. And before I was on it, I reported about it. There are a lot of oral tapes in the Neptune Museum. One of my favorite people that I interviewed was Commander Isaac Schlossbach, and I wrote a book about him called Ike's Travels. He was from Neptune, and he was one of our most famous personalities. He was an explorer with Admiral Byrd, he was a pilot, and he did a lot of things. He had an airport there called the Asbury Park Airport on Route 66 and Jumping Book Road. It was there for many years. During that time, they had Storyland there. They had a place where children could play and see all these animals and things. It was a little like Disney World, only on a smaller scale.    Ms. West: An amusement park.    Mrs. Goodrich: Yes. And then they had the Music Circus, which was an "in the round" kind of a theatre, like a tent. They were seven or eight years there, and we have a lot of those programs and different things in the Neptune Museum now that the new Curator shows. Robert Goulet, I guess many people know of him, started there. He was unknown at that time, and he was there. But Ike Schlossbach was what I considered our most famous person. I was involved also with writing histories of the Township. We did one in 1964, and we did one in 1976. Just last year the current Curator of the Neptune Museum, Evelyn Stryker Lewis, wrote Neptune and Shark River Hills. She used a lot of the pictures and stories that we had formerly, because I had originally written a history of Shark River Hills in 1963. I loved the "Hills," and my children loved the "Hills," and my husband loved the "Hills." It was in 1982 that he passed away. I was sixty-one years old at that time, and I was still working at the Museum. I decided I didn't want to live alone in my nice house that we had expanded in Shark River Hills. So I looked around at different places. I went to Ocean Grove, and I went to Red Bank, and I went to other places. And I put my name on the list here because I love the Navesink River here, and I love Red Bank. It's a nice walking town. But I didn't move here then, because I worked five more years in the Museum. I retired in 1987. I told my children I would give it two years more in the house, and then I decided to move here. And that was a great decision because Red Bank is a very interesting town, and it's historic too. The river is beautiful.    Ms. West: What river is that?    Mrs. Goodrich: The Navesink River, which is named after an Indian tribe. I continued being on the Monmouth County Heritage Committee until 1990, I guess it was. And then somebody else from Red Bank was appointed because I didn't want to drive anymore to Freehold for the meetings.    Ms. West: What did you do as a member of the Heritage Committee?    Mrs. Goodrich: We were very involved with the Tercentenary and also Monmouth County's history. We had various affairs. George Goodfellow was the first Director of it, and then Mr. Bob Farrell was in charge of it. We would talk about different things, and historians from all over Monmouth County would come to the meetings. Dr. Peter Guthorn was a surgeon who had written histories of boats and things. And he was on the Committee, along with many others.    Ms. West: Could you give us a little history about Monmouth County? How was the terrain when you first came here?    Mrs. Goodrich: Of course the Indians were here originally in Monmouth County. Then there was the Monmouth Patent, and all of that. Shark River Hills was rural at that time. The most important area in Neptune was in Hamilton, where the Stout Farm was located. We did try to save the Stout Farm there, but we weren't successful.    Ms. West: What was the Stout Farm?    Mrs. Goodrich: Well, it had been there since the 1800s. It was built by two brothers, and five or six generations lived in it. Of course Monmouth County was a farming and fishing community, and Red Bank had boats here that went to New York. James Reevy, who I knew quite well, was a member of the Sand Hill Indians of Neptune. He came quite often to discuss different memories, and we had some things in the Neptune Museum from him. Sand Hill was on Springwood and Springdale Avenues in Neptune. Indians used to have peaceful pow-wows there, and they would live there. They would go to the Shark River to fish and gather oysters. It had oysters years ago, oyster beds like they did in the Navesink River, too. It's all in the Township of Neptune History Book. There's a lot about the Sand Hill Indians. But James Reevy just died recently, and we will miss him because he had a lot of the lore of the New Jersey Indians. I think we have several of his costumes still on mannequins in the Museum in Neptune.    Ms. West: Is there any particular location in Monmouth County that is of particular interest to you?    Mrs. Goodrich: Ocean Grove, I would say. Ocean Grove has the Methodist Camp Meeting Association, and that's how we got involved in living down here. When I was a child, my parents would summer in Ocean Grove. That's when my Mother and Dad bought the property in Shark River Hills in 1925. At that time no cars were allowed in Ocean Grove on Sunday. As little children, we would go to the Auditorium, which was huge. And we loved to go to the Sampler Inn and the Grand Atlantic, which were cafeterias. And we would swim in the ocean. You couldn't swim on Sunday, but of course that has all changed. You know how progress is or whatever, things do change.    Ms. West: Would you know what year that was when it was?    Mrs. Goodrich: The court case was round 1974.  It's in the Township history. I think I have it some place, but my memory is going a little.    Ms. West: You mentioned your family, but you didn't mention if you had siblings.    Mrs. Goodrich: I had a brother.    Ms. West: Just a brother?    Mrs. Goodrich: Yes. He is three years older than I am, and he is retired in Florida. His name is Raymond.    Ms. West: Did he live down here in Monmouth County also, or did he stay up in Union County?    Mrs. Goodrich: We were in Union County in Elizabeth. He moved to Brick Township and lived there a long time with his wife and three boys. But he has retired and moved to Florida now.    Ms. West: So he did come to Monmouth County at one point?    Mrs. Goodrich: Yes. For awhile he lived in Ocean Grove…for a short while. Brick Township, though, isn't in Monmouth County  it's in Ocean County.    Ms. West: You mentioned about books. What did you think of books…did you have any favorite books that you liked to read…as a youngster or in your lifetime?    Mrs. Goodrich: Oh, I was always a reader and always involved with libraries. I still am an avid reader, although now I have to read large print. Well, let me think what kind of books… When I was a child I liked Heidi and Pinocchio.    Ms. West: Did you have a favorite author?    Mrs. Goodrich: I don't think so. I like James Michener now, but his books are voluminous. But he's a historian in a sense, too, and I enjoy his books. Right now I sort of enjoy mystery books.    Ms. West: Since you have lived in Monmouth County, was there anyone in particular who might have had an influence on your life?    Mrs. Goodrich: I would say Mrs. Margaret Mauch, who was our first librarian in the little library on Corlies Avenue. She sort of encouraged me to write my first history of Shark River Hills. When I started researching, I was a reporter and columnist for the Ocean Grove and Neptune Times, and I would write these little history articles and vignettes. She would say, "Peggy, I know you are interested in this. Why don't you continue on?" Of course Ike Schlossbach was influential, and there was my dear husband, who has passed away.    Ms. West: The Schlossbach family, are they still in Neptune?    Mrs. Goodrich: I think most of them have passed away. It was a large family, and they all went to college. They were all professionals. There was Dr. Ted Schlossbach, who was the Township doctor in Neptune. He has passed away, too.    Ms. West: Did you have any heroes or heroines, and who were they?    Mrs. Goodrich: When I was small, I think I liked Helen Keller. I thought she did wonderful things with being so handicapped. I don't know, I just looked up to her. I also think I looked up to Charles Lindburgh when I was a child.    Ms. West: What was Helen Keller's handicap?    Mrs. Goodrich: She was blind and deaf, and she had a teacher who helped her learn to talk and everything. She wrote books, and she did a lot with her life. Her affliction happened to her when she was nineteen months old. I had a little resume that I did for our little newsletter, Reflections, in June 1999, and that included some of my seventy-eight year memories of the twentieth century. And I have a copy of what I have written.    Ms. West: Please read it.    Mrs. Goodrich: Well it isn't all of Monmouth County, but I'll read some of it. Do you remember Charles Lindburgh's historic solo flight from New York to Paris in 1927? Then after that Ann and Charles Lindburgh's young son, Charles, was kidnapped and killed. And the trial was flamboyant in the paper and on the radio. Of course we didn't have television then, just the radio.    Ms. West: Speaking of radio, were there any favorite programs that you liked to listen to on the radio?    Mrs. Goodrich: You mean now?    Ms. West: No, back in the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s…prior to television.    Mrs. Goodrich: I don't think so. I was a pretty busy little girl, and I don't think I could listen to what my parents did. Of course, they liked classical music and things like that. I think there was Chandu, the magician, and I forget several others like that which were on when I was small. I did listen to the news, and I was very concerned even though I was very young at that time, about Lindburgh's little boy being kidnapped.    Ms. West: Do you remember the names of any of the news commentators on the radio?    Mrs. Goodrich: You're scratching my memory! (laughter) Walter Cronkite…did he go back that far? I am trying to think. And then the Depression years came in 1929, and the Wall Street Crash affected so many people. They didn't build houses very much for a long time, so my dad's business went down because no one needed the framing tools and saw sets. It wasn't until World War II that it picked up again. And he was President of Taintor Manufacturing Company, which lasted seventy-five years. I could even show you what a saw set and a framing tool looks like. Then Admiral Byrd's scientific expeditions were heard over the radio, and Commander Schlossbach from Neptune talked on one of the expeditions from Antarctica. Now this was in Monmouth County, the Morro Castle burned off Asbury Park in 1934. I remember we came down from Elizabeth to see it. And then there was the Hindenberg Dirigible crash in 1937. These are just some of my memories.    Ms. West: Where was the Hindenberg Dirigible?    Mrs. Goodrich: The Dirigible was in Lakehurst. Then that great movie came out, and it was considered an all-time great movie. It was called Gone With the Wind, and it was adapted from Margaret Mitchell's book.    Ms. West: Speaking of movies, do you remember the first movie you ever saw?    Mrs. Goodrich: It was Rin Tin Tin. I loved dogs.    Ms. West: It was about a dog?    Mrs. Goodrich: Yes, Rin Tin Tin was a dog. I also recall the abdication of England's Edward VIII in 1936, and he later married Mrs. Simpson, and they became the Duke and Duchess of Windsor. Then came World War II, and of course my husband was in it four years, nine months and eleven days. And I still can remember 32063703 was his dog tag number.    Ms. West: Oh, for heaven's sake!    Mrs. Goodrich: Yes, I wrote so many letters that I remember it well. That year in Chicago before Bob went overseas was great overall, but in some ways, it wasn't. At that time I was Secretary to the Sales Manager of Eversharp, Inc. And they were in the War Industry. I had to stay in the War Industry until the War was over. Once it ended, I had my position in Goerke's and Steinbach's Department Stores as Executive Secretary. Of course during World War II, there was Hitler and the Holocaust. And there was Pearl Harbor, and the Atomic Bomb, food stamps, and Victory Gardens. And there was VE Day and VJ Day in 1945, and I remember so well when we worked, we couldn't get silk stockings at that time. It was very hard to get them. So we would go to the shore in the summer and get our legs tanned, and then you would use your eye liner pencil to put the line down the back of your leg, because stockings had seams years ago. And then no one knew we weren't wearing stockings! Of course so many of us had the Victory Gardens.    Ms. West: What was the Victory Garden?    Mrs. Goodrich: Well, you grew vegetables and all different kinds of things, because you couldn't buy some of those things. Of course we had food stamps, too.    Ms. West: Tell us about the food stamps.    Mrs. Goodrich: Well, that was where you could only get so much meat or whatever with the food stamps. I remember in Chicago that once in awhile if Bob had off on a Sunday, he would invite some men that were from his Army Air Force Squad to come for dinner. And they would in advance give me some of their food stamps so I could buy a little steak for them and everything else. And I wasn't a very good cook at that time, I must admit that. So I always supplied them with a drink or two before they ate, and they always thought I cooked a good meal. (laughter)    Ms. West: What other kinds of stamps did they have during the War?    Mrs. Goodrich: I remember the food stamps, but I think gasoline was rationed, also at a premium. I remember for our honeymoon when Bob came home in 1942, when we were married, we divided the gasoline in half and ended up in Paramus, New Jersey close to the George Washington Bridge. And we left the car there during the daytime, and we stayed at a motel there. We'd walk over to New York in the daytime to go to a show or eat or something, and then we'd walk back again. But there was a gasoline shortage, of course, and I remember the food stamps and the Victory Gardens.  We were all united in wanting to win that War. That was a united effort. That's when women went back to work. I don't remember if I mentioned it before, but Mother was a teacher. And this was sort of interesting: When woman teachers got married years ago, they couldn't teach anymore. Married women were not allowed to teach. So it was in the Depression years that Mother went back to work part-time. Then Ghandi was shot to death in 1948, and I'm still listing some of the things from my seventy-eight year memories that I had listed in our Reflections. Then there was the Space Program…the Apollo Flight in 1969. And then television came into being before that. Do you remember those people who would go into street corners in the city to look at a television in a store? You didn't have them in your house at that time. And when you could finally afford a television, they were so huge. The mechanism and the back of it was very large. The picture was tiny, but the back of the television was huge.    Ms. West: What newspaper headlines from the past might stand out in your mind and memory?    Mrs. Goodrich: Well we had the Elizabeth Daily Journal when I lived in Elizabeth. And the Lindburgh trial was big. Although I was only six or seven years old, I remember it so vividly because it was just a terrible thing. Of course there were the War years, and I'm talking about World War II. I guess I shouldn't assume you know it was World War II, because there have been others. And it's terrible that we do have wars.    Ms. West: As a child, what games did you like to play?    Mrs. Goodrich: Hop Scotch and Make Believe, and we did a lot of playing outside. We didn't have a television and usually after school, you would do your homework. Mother was strict  she was a former teacher. And I did my homework before I was allowed to do much else.    Ms. West: Did you have any hobbies as a youngster?    Mrs. Goodrich: I liked to write poetry. And my girlfriends and I loved the movies. If we had that quarter to go to the movie on Saturday, we would go. They would have two movies, an 'A' movie and a 'B' movie. And sometimes they even had a Vaudeville Show. I remember some of those Vaudeville Shows in Elizabeth in the Ritz Theatre and the Regent Theatre.    Ms. West: What kind of music did you like? What was the music of the day? Did you have any favorite entertainers?    Mrs. Goodrich: Well, I always felt I was sort of a comedian. So I sort of liked Zazu Pitts.    Ms. West: Who was Zazu Pitts?    Mrs. Goodrich: She was a funny actress years ago. And of course I remember Henry Fonda, and I remember liking him. There was also Katharine Hepburn. We would get together and discuss the movies and the stars. Then news wasn't slanderous like the news is now about the movie stars or actors on Broadway. Oh, and I did enjoy Alfred and Lynn Fontaine on the stage in New York, and George M. Cohen. I saw him on one of his last shows, but I liked all kinds of music. I think my favorite during the War was…a lot of people liked Frank Sinatra, and he was ok…but I liked Rosemary Clooney, Dick Haymes, and Tony Bennett. Then we had the very sad things like when President John Kennedy was assassinated in 1963 and the blackout in New York City. Do you remember that one? I had an Aunt Marge who lived in New York City, and she said she had to walk up the stairs. I think she was on the eighth floor. And she had to do this with no lights or anything. She sort of had to crawl up to get to her apartment. And then we had the terrorist bombings in the World Trade Center, and that was terrible. But you know what happened during World War II, too? A lot of things were invented like penicillin and other things that were positive. Of course there was that Salk vaccine which prevented polio. I remember Bob and I went to Shark River Hills school with our kids, and I think we had to go three times to get the pills. I think it was pills and not shots, but I forget which.    Ms. West: Well, the shots came first, and then the pills.    Mrs. Goodrich: Ok. Then it was shots that we got. And it was done free, I remember at that time. My daughter, Ruth, didn't have to get regular measles, because there was a shot for that. But the boys, both Jimmy and Bobby, had the measles. Of course there was the Vietnam War in 1968, and then the riots throughout the United States because so many felt that it wasn't a war that we should be involved in.    Ms. West: Were there any riots in Monmouth County?    Mrs. Goodrich: Yes, I remember the riot in Asbury Park quite distinctly. That was in 1970, I think. No, it was in 1969. What we were so upset about was that the television people came and made it more than it really was. And Springwood Avenue of course changed, and a lot of the businesses had to close up. Now they call it…isn't that terrible that I can't remember?    Ms. West: In Asbury Park it is back to Springwood Avenue, but in Neptune it is Westlake Avenue.    Mrs. Goodrich: Westlake Avenue is in Neptune, and it's still Springwood Avenue in Asbury Park. Yes. The school systems then sort of had disturbances, too. I think I was on the Board of Education at that time.    Ms. West: Could you tell me what has been your greatest achievement in life?    Mrs. Goodrich: I guess it would be being married and having my three children. Also being involved with history, which I loved. I liked local and county history more than anything else.    Ms. West: What is the most unusual thing about you?    Mrs. Goodrich: Gee, I don't know. I am very friendly and I like people. I don't know. I don't want to pat myself on the back or anything. I did get some awards for things I don't even recall now. But I did get one from the State and County for my historical research, and I did get state grants. But I am proud of my family. One of my children did die at age forty-one…Jimmy. And we miss him terribly. And of course we miss my husband. The impeachment of the two Presidents, well it wasn't exactly an impeachment. Nixon resigned and more recently Clinton was acquitted after an impeachment trial. He was never impeached, but there were impeachment proceedings, and Richard Nixon resigned. Bill Clinton was acquitted by the Senate last year. Of course there was the passing away of Mother Theresa and Princess Diana. And there are the huge companies divesting now, and you don't know what bank you have now! The names change so fast. Then of course, we had the Y2K situation.    Ms. West: And it didn't even come to pass.    Mrs. Goodrich: Well, it was good because they all got prepared for it. I don't think I mentioned that Martin Luther King was honored with a National holiday. He was assassinated, as well as Bobby and John Kennedy. But I think the Black history is coming into the forefront now, and I think it's great. I know in the Neptune Museum, we try to honor African-Americans more. Leanora McKay wrote some very good Black history books.    Ms. West: Let's get back to you now. Did you live your life any differently than you thought you might have when you were a youngster?    Mrs. Goodrich: Oh, I never thought I would be a Museum Curator. Never. I thought I would be an Executive Secretary, and I was. But I loved local history and being a volunteer kind of led me into it gradually and easily. Reporting for the Ocean Grove and Neptune Times for years and doing vignettes of people and historical things got me very interested.    Ms. West: Is there anything that you think you would like to accomplish that you haven't yet?    Mrs. Goodrich: Well, I would like to see world peace and people getting along together. I would like there not to be racial or ethnic problems. It just seems that there have been problems since the world began, and it continues that way. But I hope and pray that some time people will be more tolerant of everybody and judge an individual instead of a whole group. I don't know if you noticed this, but here is an oil painting of me done in Chicago. I was twenty-three. At nighttime, I did a little modeling, and this was a businessman's art club. This man named Paul Olson said when we had a home of our own, he would give it to my husband, Bob. And he did.    Ms. West: That was nice of him. It is a lovely painting.    Mrs. Goodrich: You wouldn't know it is me, now! (laughter) I have had a good life. I have gone through sorrows, but it is like everybody. We all have our problems or challenges.    Ms. West: If you could describe your life as a roadmap, how would it have been? What route did it take? Uphill, downhill, rocky or smooth?    Mrs. Goodrich: I think life is an adventure, and we should go along with the ups and the downs. When you have the ups, Dad used to say, I should pinch myself, because the ups won't last that long. When I was on the Board of Education from 1969 to 1972, that was when we had trouble in the schools and everything. And we tried so hard and did resolve some of the things. But I had good parents, and Elizabeth was a good city to be brought up in. And we summered in Ocean Grove and Asbury Park.    Ms. West: Did your parents ever live here in the County?    Mrs. Goodrich: Yes, they moved to Ocean Grove and lived there many years. Mother later lived in Pitman Manor, which was a Methodist Home in South Jersey. And Mother loved it. She said it was the nearest place to God! And I love it here in Red Bank. I think if you live alone and want to be with people, this is a good place. You can have as much independence as you want, and you can be private if you want to. I was very involved in the Navesink House, and I was Secretary for the Residents Council. I was the Vice President, and I was the Historian here for eight years. I wrote articles for the Reflections, and I made a lot of displays. I have a little display here of bells from all over the world.    Ms. West: Reflections of what…Navesink or Red Bank?    Mrs. Goodrich: Well it is called Reflections, and it is a bimonthly newsletter with eight pages. It has different articles, and we would put historical items in it. We had our twenty-fifth and our thirtieth anniversary, and I was on that committee. We had a lot of activities. We had a time capsule. We just planted it out in the garden at the beginning of this year. We put some different things in it…we even put a beanie baby in it! The time capsule is here at the Navesink House in the garden. Hopefully, when they build a new building, maybe they will put it in a wall or something there, and it will be opened in fifty years. I think that's when it is supposed to be opened.    Ms. West: What year did you plant it?    Mrs. Goodrich: Just in this year, in January of 2000. It's hard to remember that it is the year 2000, to remember to write it on your checks and everything.    Ms. West: It's inconceivable! If you could choose a symbol of your life, what would it be? Maybe a candle or a flower, or a cat or dog, or whatever.    Mrs. Goodrich: I would say a book. I love to read and learn. I'm always open to learning new things. So I would say a book. And maybe I would say The Bible.    Ms. West: What are the milestones in your life?    Mrs. Goodrich: My marriage, my three children, the awards I received for my history involvement, and the fact that I was put in Who's Who In The East and Who's Who In New Jersey.    Ms. West: What year were you listed in those?    Mrs. Goodrich: 1983, 1984, 1985, 1986, and 1992. And then I retired in 1987. And there were County awards: that is a picture of the Director of the County, Harry Larrison Jr., giving me an award.    Ms. West: The award was for what?    Mrs. Goodrich: For being a Monmouth County Historian.    Ms. West: Do you have any grandchildren?    Mrs. Goodrich: Yes, five of them.    Ms. West: Oh wonderful. Do they live here in the County?    Mrs. Goodrich: No, two are from Quakertown, Pennsylvania. And my oldest grandson, Patrick, is in Syracuse. He is a freshman at the university there. The other grandson, Michael, is also my daughter's child, and Kirkner is their name. The other three grandchildren are children of my son Jimmy, who passed away, and Goodrich is their name. His widow lives down in South Carolina. And they came up for my birthday last year. They were here all together, and it was nice. I see the boys from Pennsylvania more than I see the ones from South Carolina. They are closer, and they are growing up. But I did a lot of babysitting when they were little. I think you almost love your grandchildren more than you do your own children, because you can take care of them and then give them back again. (laughter)    Ms. West: It makes a difference, doesn't it?    Mrs. Goodrich: It sure does.    Ms. West: What would be your legacy to your family?    Mrs. Goodrich: Well, I wrote a history of my life with Bob and everything. And I have it in a file in there. I hope my legacy will be humility, love, and caring for other people. And that you can do anything you want to if you try hard enough. I think working hard is very important, and I think education is important, too. But if you are motivated and really want to do something, I think you can do it. I don't recommend anyone to be President of the United States, though. (laughter)    Ms. West: What concerns you most about the state of the world today?    Mrs. Goodrich: I am very concerned about the world. We are involved all over the world now, and I guess we have to be. But with the wars going on and so many children starving and homeless, I don't know. You just hope it will be better. You try to have a better world for your children and your grandchildren, and I think we sort of spoil them sometimes nowadays. You see children get things earlier and earlier, and they are smarter than we were. But there is so much violence on television and in books now and movies, too.    Ms. West: What are your values?    Mrs. Goodrich: They are summed up in the one saying, "Do unto others as you would have them do unto you."     Ms. West: What are your personal strengths?    Mrs. Goodrich: I think I get my strength from my parents. I try to do the best I can and then I hand it over to God.    Ms. West: What advice would you give to the present generation?    Mrs. Goodrich: Well, I think the majority of kids are doing a good job, I really do. They are smarter and they know more. I would just tell them to be tolerant and love your neighbor as themselves. I think we all should realize that "There but for the grace of God, go I."    Ms. West: Would you like to live any part of your life again?    Mrs. Goodrich: No, I feel I have had a good life. I enjoyed what I did, and I put my whole heart into whatever I did. And I got to know you today!    Ms. West: Well thank you. Meeting you has been my pleasure. You mentioned that you were the Founder of the Museum in Neptune. What year was that?    Mrs. Goodrich: It was in 1971.    Ms. West: Was that the same year the Neptune Library moved from Corlies Avenue to its present location?    Mrs. Goodrich: Right. I'll tell you I was in people's attics, and I went any place I could to get things. Jim Reevy was very helpful, and the Richardsons were helpful, too. I interviewed them, and a lot of the oral tape is in the Neptune Museum now.    Ms. West: Did you do much traveling around Monmouth County?    Mrs. Goodrich: Well it's a local, historical museum. So it's Ocean Grove and the Hamilton section, which is the oldest, and Shark River Hills section and Whitesville, too.    Ms. West: Right, but did you yourself do much traveling, aside from the historical aspect?    Mrs. Goodrich: Well, I went to Freehold often. This is a picture of Joe Lopez, and his lineage goes back to the Indians, but not the Sand Hill Indians. I think he is still in Francioni, Taylor, and Lopez, a funeral business. I am sure I have forgotten a lot of things. This is what our library looked like on Corlies Avenue. And Mrs. Mauch encouraged me to get involved in history. I was a volunteer, and she saw how interested I was. The library was there ten years, and then it moved over to the Municipal Complex in Neptune.    Ms. West: So you were truly a historian of Neptune Township.    Mrs. Goodrich: And Monmouth County, too. I was on the Monmouth County Heritage Committee for a long time, and I was a historian even in the Navesink House for eight years. But my eyesight is getting poor now, and I decided it should be someone else.    Ms. West: How many books have you written about the Township?    Mrs. Goodrich: I wrote Ike's Travels, and a book History of Shark River Hill's  I was co-author of The History of the Township of Neptune, and we had the first one published when Neptune was eighty-five years old. But I like the history of Red Bank, too. It has a lot of interesting things about it. They have restored Broad Street, and they are trying to upgrade the buildings, and they have brick sidewalks there now. And the little Riverside and Marine Parks on the river here have had a lot of programs. And of course, Count Basie Theatre is very popular. I go there quite often. Count Basie was born in Red Bank.    Ms. West: Who is Count Basie?    Mrs. Goodrich: Well, he was a musical genius.    Ms. West: What instrument did he play, or did he sing?    Mrs. Goodrich: I have sort of forgotten. Was it the piano? And I think he had an orchestra, too.    Ms. West: Do you remember what he was called during his professional years?    Mrs. Goodrich: No.    Ms. West: He was known as "The Kid from Red Bank."    Mrs. Goodrich: Ok. I didn't know too much about Red Bank until I came here. It has been  ten and a half years that I have been here. The only place I really knew was the Molly Pitcher Inn then.    Ms. West: What is the Molly Pitcher Inn?    Mrs. Goodrich: It's a lovely restaurant on the river.    Ms. West: Do you know how it got its name?    Mrs. Goodrich: Yes, from Molly Pitcher from the American Revolution. It's a legend, but she gave pitchers of water to the soldiers when they were fighting. Then I think her husband was wounded, and she then became a soldier herself.    Ms. West: You mentioned Dr. Peter Guthorn. Was that a known family here?    Mrs. Goodrich: He was a well-known surgeon at the Jersey Shore Medical Center. And he loved Monmouth County history, too. He was on the Monmouth County Heritage Committee. He wrote about skiffs and different kind of boats in Monmouth County. But he has passed away. I forget when he retired to Florida. Sam Smith wrote some histories of Monmouth County, too.    Ms. West: Who was Sam Smith?    Mrs. Goodrich: A well-known Monmouth County historian and author.     Ms. West: Talking with you has brought back a lot of old memories. It has been my pleasure meeting you and talking with you.    Mrs. Goodrich: It has been my pleasure to have you here.  
MonmouthCounty;Ellen Williams;1931;2000;Ellen Williams, 1931, 2000        Interview with          Remembering The 20th Century: An Oral History of Monmouth County    Date of Interview: September 17, 2000  Name of Interviewer: Ellen Williams  Premises of Interview: Home of Clyde MacKenzie, Jr., Fair Haven, NJ  Birthdate of Subject: June 4, 1931    Ms. Williams: Tell me what you've discovered here in Monmouth County.    Mr. MacKenzie: Well, I'm interested in fishing histories, and I wrote a book published by Rutgers University Press, on the fishing industry here in Monmouth County and also in Staten Island. I got most of the information from interviews of about eighty people living in the County. I concentrated on people who were over fifty-five years of age. I did that so I could get back in time as far as I could get. People remember the first year or two on their first job, including a fishery job, quite clearly. But they don't remember dates in the middle of their working experience. Most of these people were retired. They loved being interviewed about their work. It was kind of interesting because most of them said that nobody in their own families is interested in hearing about their work. The grandkids didn't want to hear anything about it. They'd always wanted to talk about the old days, but nobody would listen to them. Especially their grandchildren.    Ms. Williams: That seems to be a pretty common situation where families don't listen as much as other people. That's pretty common in oral history.    Mr. MacKenzie: So when I came in with a notepad and a tape machine to record them, they loved to talk about their fishing experience. Fishing is something like farming  it's an industry that makes you sort of feel good because every day you're out catching, gathering crop. It satisfies a basic human need.    Ms. Williams: Were you commissioned this research?    Mr. MacKenzie: I did it on my own  it was my own idea to do it. I wrote an article about it in a government journal and I wanted to do it to find out why fish and shellfish are scarce now. I'd heard that they were very abundant years ago. Around the turn of the century, there was a huge oyster industry here, a big clamming industry - soft shell clamming and hard shell clamming and oystering. And there was a lot more fin fishing then, too. What happened? Why did it decline? At Sandy Hook, we try to understand all aspects of the environment, and then try to improve the habitat that these animals live in. If we know what changes have occurred, then maybe we would know then how to improve it. After that, the animals may become more abundant.    Ms. Williams: What were some of the findings of that research?    Mr. MacKenzie: Well, the bay became polluted, and that's why the oyster industry died out. It died out in the 1920s. It had been a huge industry here. It was an incredibly neat industry, because juvenile oysters were brought up here from Chesapeake Bay mainly, but some were taken out of Newark Bay and the Raritan River, and they were spread out in Raritan Bay to grow for a year and then and then they were harvested in the late fall or early winter and sold in New York City. It was very close to the market and any time the market needed oysters, boats could come right here and get them. It was quite handy. It was one of the nearest sources of a product that the New York City fish market had.    Ms. Williams: Is there a particular source of pollution that was identified?    Mr. MacKenzie: It was mostly domestic sewage pollution. Raritan Bay became infamous in the oyster business because typhoid fever was present in the bay. It had been picked up by the oysters, people ate these oysters, became sick, and some died, even people as far west as Chicago. The whole oyster industry was almost shut down in the 1920s because production along the entire coast was affected, all the way down to Florida. Chesapeake Bay oyster production was cut in half as a result of that typhoid scare that emanated from Raritan Bay oysters .    Ms. Williams: The people you interviewed must have been very emotional about this. Did you find that there were many emotions connected to this?    Mr. MacKenzie: Well, the people I interviewed didn't know too much about the oyster industry, because it happened so long ago, but the soft shell clamming fishery was shut down, and the hard shell clamming fishery was shut down. And they were extremely emotional about those. They were shattered, they felt that their whole life had been cut off. Their fathers, their grandfathers did it, they learned how to do it from them when they were children, and they grew up practicing their methods. They were proud of the type of rake their father used, and they were using the same rake. They inherited their fathers' boats. One man had just bought two rakes, and the next day they said they shut the bay, and he said that he just broke down in tears because of it.    Ms. Williams: When was this book published?    Mr. MacKenzie: 1992.    Ms. Williams: What was the name of the book?    Mr. MacKenzie: The Fisheries of Raritan Bay.    Ms. Williams: And how long did the period of your research last?    Mr. MacKenzie: The research and the writing took about five years. One regret that I have is that I didn't begin until I had been here for ten years and I missed ten years of early history. I wish I had gone to Keyport, the center of the oyster industry much earlier. When I went there and to Highlands to talk about the clams, everybody said, "Oh, you should have interviewed so and so, or done this last year when so and so was still alive, he was ninety-five, did it all his life, and you missed him." That was a regret that I didn't get down to interview some people when I first got here. That was a shame, I could have gone back in time another ten years.    Ms. Williams: How did you arrive in New Jersey in the first place? What brought you here?    Mr. MacKenzie: Well, I was working on an oyster rehabilitation program in Prince Edward Island, Canada for a year. We were successful in because we turned the industry around. It had been declining. The upward swing continued for about ten years  every year was better than the previous year. Now it's kind of leveled off, because there's no more ground to plant oysters on. I transferred to Prince Edward Island from the Milford laboratory in Milford, Connecticut where I'd been for fourteen years. I'd worked with the oyster industry there.    Ms. Williams: Your educational background is in Canada, I understand.    Mr. MacKenzie: No, my education was at the University of Massachusetts and William and Mary. But I grew up on Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts. I worked my way through college harvesting shellfish there. Scallops, hard shell clams, and soft shell clams. A paper of mine about the natural history of the soft shell clam around here was published recently. I worked for five years on that project, spending about a third of my time on it for five years. And I really enjoyed doing that, because I had worked harvesting soft shell clams commercially when I was a young fellow.    Ms. Williams: So it comes full circle. You worked in this industry as a child and ending up doing research on it as an adult.    Mr. MacKenzie: I really enjoyed that.    Ms. Williams: What do you find from your historical research in Highlands, Atlantic Highlands, and Keyport? Is there any particular information that came out of that that would be of interest to the reader or the listener of this tape, about the fishing industry?    Mr. MacKenzie: At the time I began this research, the fishermen were kind of by themselves. They were thought of as pirates. People were pretty negative about them around here. And I went to them as a friend and talked to them in a friendly way, and they warmed up to me.    Ms. Williams: Why were they thought of as pirates?    Mr. MacKenzie: Well, fishermen are always on the edge of the law all the time. For example, the lobstermen can't take lobsters that are too small, they have to measure every lobster. Many keepers are just large enough. You see what I mean about being on the edge. There's a history of fishermen in Monmouth County taking undersized lobsters. Before the federal government got interested in these fish, how many fish were taken, before they started going into decline the fishery was just wide open, there were laws, but they took undersized lobsters anyway, brought them in and sold them. They sold, for about a dollar a dozen, people used to like to eat small lobsters  they're quite tender.    Ms. Williams: But they were taken in violation of the law.    Mr. MacKenzie: Yes. There's a history of violations of the law by the fisherman. Raritan Bay is a huge area here. It was illegal to use otter trawls to catch scup, or porgy as they call them here in Raritan Bay. You could use otter trawls out in the ocean, but use of them was so lucrative that they used to go out here and fish for the scup at night illegally in the bay. There were twenty or thirty boats doing it. They fish in a little group together, and they had a watchman on one of the boats, usually a kid, who would see when a warden was going to approach them. They knew the warden's boat off in the distance, and when the warden was coming towards them, they hauled in their nets.    Ms. Williams: It's actually the illegal fishing and taking fish and shellfish from Raritan Bay that is polluted that affected people's images of them.    Mr. MacKenzie: Yes. It was a negative image of the fishermen. But they're really nice people. I used to tell them I felt they're very ambitious to fish at night. They wanted to go fishing. They loved it. They liked to make money too, but they loved it. Fishing's fun when you're catching fish and making money at it, too! It can be a fun business.    Ms. Williams: You have eighty interviews.    Mr. MacKenzie: I have tapes of about forty-five still remaining.    Ms. Williams: What do you hope to do with those tapes?    Mr. MacKenzie: I'd like to keep a few to listen to in my old age because I enjoy hearing those fishermen talk, but I'd like to donate them to somebody who would put them to good use and wouldn't destroy them. I think they're valuable. I've offered them to some people and they say, "Well, are they transcribed?" Somebody else said, "Well, write it up. We don't just want the transcriptions, we want a summary." I said I've already written a book about it. But I think the fishermen's voices and their inflections, and the way they talk has some value, too.     Ms. Williams: Right. If you had a video, too, that would be helpful. Did you ever do that?    Mr. MacKenzie: No.    Mr. MacKenzie:  I'm writing an article with five other scientists, on history of the hard clam fishery from Canada, and Eastern United States to Mexico. A friend who used to work with me in Canada, is writing the Canadian part, and then we have four others in the United States in Florida, South Carolina, North Carolina, me here and a friend in Mexico. There's one separate part of it that I'd like to see written up and published in another journal. This part is in Monmouth County. We observed that in bays where hard clams are abundant, the openings to the ocean are huge. One of the openings is the Raritan Bay opening. It's wide, there's a large flush of water going back and forth. The rise and fall of tide in an ocean beach is about six feet, and in Raritan Bay it's about six feet. Down at the Barnegat Bay, which of course is not in Monmouth County, but which used to be a large producer of hard shell clams, the opening is very tiny, and there aren't many clams there anymore. The rise and fall of tide is still six feet on the beach and along the shore in Barnegat it's six inches, because there's so little water going in and out. There's been a huge buildup of human population along the shores, especially along the west shore, and they polluted the water. There are brown tides and the water gets all brown from an over abundance of plankton and the clams don't spawn, they don't grow, and those that do survive grow very slowly and their meats get black when they ingest these organisms. When the clam meat is stained black, it is called black clam. So we want to post a paper about that. These are just two examples. There are several examples of bays which have wide openings which have a lot of clams. Another bay with a small opening is Great South Bay in Long Island. It has a very narrow opening and brown tides, just like Barnegat Bay. I was just talking with one of the co-authors of this proposed article on Friday. He wants us to do it.    Ms. Williams: You said you were also going to Honduras for research. What will be the nature of that?    Mr. MacKenzie: I'm describing a fishery down there for a clam, a mangrove cockle it's called. It's a clam about two inches long that grows among the mangrove prop roots in muddy sediments. From Mexico down to Peru about fifteen thousand people harvest these, and they are all artesian fishermen. On my vacation, instead of going to a resort or something, I go down there surveying.  I came up with about fifteen thousand fisherman. I'm finding out how many of cockles fishermen get a day, how much money they get for them, how much the dealers are paid for them, and what sort of meals they prepare. I will have a section in this paper on how these fishing people live, what is their background, not just how they harvest their fish or how prosperous they are.    Ms. Williams: Have you found that they've been able to prosper?    Mr. MacKenzie: Oh, they're very poor. Just barely hanging on, just barely surviving. The girls just live with men, they rarely have a church wedding service. They have children right away. And the men abandon most of them. I don't know if the girls pick up a second or third husband or not. The men don't give them any support afterwards, and so women have to go out and harvest the cockles. A lot of men harvest cockles also, in fact most of the fishermen are men. When the kids are old enough, seven, eight, nine years old, the kids go out and harvest them, too.    Ms. Williams: It's their daily sustenance, then.    Mr. MacKenzie: Their daily sustenance. They live from hand to mouth. I spoke with three girls, teenagers walking down the street in El Salvador with cockles. Each had maybe thirty or forty, and they'd just come in from harvesting. I said, "You girls go every day?" I wanted to find out how often they go. "Oh, we have to go every day to eat." They were on their way to sell these, get some money, then go buy food to eat that day. They had to go the next day. If they didn't go the next day, they wouldn't have any money for food.     Ms. Williams: You're performing a very important service by making sure that they have the ability to keep that going.     Mr. MacKenzie: I'm describing this fishery and also trying to describe how these people live, and how much money they have. There are shrimp farmers who have gone down there and ripped out a lot of the mangroves, especially in Ecuador. They didn't care anything about these cockle fishermen.    Ms. Williams: Are there any guidelines or laws?    Mr. MacKenzie: No. The government of Ecuador is trying to slow down the destruction of the mangroves, but the fisherman say that they're not going to stop. They pay local help to work at a minimum wage, which is about three dollars a half a day. They get almost that much for a pound of shrimp.    Ms. Williams: Well, it's important information to keep these communities going.    Mr. MacKenzie: I hope so. I've been down to Honduras twice already, and there seems to be a need for a third time. When I went to see these people a  second time, they asked, "When's the help coming?" They think I'm going to bring help. They are always friendly. As I talk to these people they enjoy it and laugh to relieve them of their poverty, but it's tough to do that.    Ms. Williams: Do you find the people here are interested in that research, then, when you come back? Do you have a group of people supporting it?    Mr. MacKenzie: Not particularly - a little bit.    Ms. Williams: What about Sandy Hook? What have you been doing there?    Mr. MacKenzie: Let me just tell you one more thing about Ecuador. I submitted the paper to my superiors at Woods Hole, and I thought a sensitive part would be the effect of the shrimp farms on the mangroves. I thought it seemed a little delicate to get into, but they passed right over that. What they felt was very sensitive was how these people live.     Ms. Williams: You mean they didn't want to talk about poverty or the situation they're living in? That's integrated with the lifestyle and the fishing.    Mr. MacKenzie: I argued with them, saying, "I want to put this in there, it's all accurate, I feel it's all a good report." And this man said, "Well, alright, we'll show it to an anthropologist on the staff here, and if she says okay, we'll do it." And she said okay, because she thought it important to provide the background of how these fishing people live as I do. A friend of mine here on the staff said, "You ought to describe how the fishermen here in Monmouth County live, what kind of homes they live in." I think that's going to be the most interesting part of this paper. This cockle fishery has never been described before in international literature. I'm hoping that more people go down there and see avenues of research in the mangrove areas of Latin America,  not only of the biology of the cockles, but also to get involved in community development.    Ms. Williams: What about Sandy Hook and what you're doing there?    Mr. MacKenzie: I spent five years working on the biology and habitat analysis of the soft shell clam, and my paper about it just came out. We want to see if we could restore the habitat of the soft-shell clams. The clams are scarce here now, although they used to be abundant.     Ms. Williams: What were your research findings?    Mr. MacKenzie: Well, for one thing, there was a huge die off here in 1995 as a result of a very hot summer. Maybe a quarter million bushels were killed off when fishermen were just starting to harvest them. It was terrible. I'd been studying those clams since they had just set and following them every month. I observed them, all dying in the heat, and I almost cried when I saw that. Another thing, I'm sure it has been going on for centuries, is that the killey fish eat the juvenile clams. Each fish will eat maybe thirty, forty, fifty a day.     The South shore of Raritan Bay had washed away slowly when at very low tide, a man made a survey here in 1878. The flat from the shore extended about a mile, now there's no flat there at all in a very low tide. At low tide, waves are breaking right against the shore. I'm giving a talk on the twenty-fourth or twenty-fifth in New York. There's a conference being held as a result of the population increase and all the nitrates in the water. There's been a huge increase in the amount of sea lettuce. It grows out over clams and other animals living in the sediments and smothers them, kills them. People contribute nitrates to the water which supports the sea lettuce.    Ms. Williams: Do you visit Sandy Hook as a consultant? You're getting a lot of important data from people. Are many people actually implementing your suggestions?    Mr. MacKenzie: It's weird. Authorities implemented my suggestions in Prince Edward Island, implemented my suggestions in Connecticut when I was there, and helped build oyster production in Connecticut. But here, I don't know. There are so many people, so many different agencies and groups involved with the habitat around here, it's difficult to do anything. I talk to people about the sea lettuce and they said, "Well, you can't remove that because the American Littoral Society will protest against it. It's a natural phenomenon that's growing." And I say it really isn't, it's growing there because of all the nutrients in all the waste that's going in the water. "No, no, we can't do that." But there are at least six groups of people here in the County who each think that they are the manager of these resources.    Ms. Williams: There are a lot of things that are getting in each other's way.    Mr. MacKenzie: There's the Bay Keeper, which is part of the Littoral Society, there's the Audubon Society, there's the State DEP, there's the Monmouth County Environmental Association, and the Monmouth County Water Resource Association. They all sort of think that they are the appropriate managers. In addition, the National League Fishery Service is involved. Each group thinks that it's the main one.    Ms. Williams: That makes for a lot of complicated decision making. Sandy Hook has had those festivals for Clean Ocean Action, and they seem to be trying to keep things more public as far as getting people's awareness up.    Mr. MacKenzie: I just submitted my paper on the soft-shell clam and the sea lettuce to Curt Moore in the Asbury Park Press Friday to see if he'd be interested in writing an article about my findings.    Ms. Williams: Do you teach?    Mr. MacKenzie: No, I don't. Just write papers, send them out, and give talks around the meetings. I try to keep my own research as practical and usable as I can. I grew up in town with people who were poor back in the 1930s. There was a laboratory only twelve miles away, with one of the top shellfish researchers in the world, Paul Galtsoff, who didn't add one individual shellfish to the waters of Martha's Vineyard. I said, "If I ever get in there I'm going to work on practical problems and try to add shellfish to beds as best I can."    Ms. Williams: Would you say that your family experience has influenced you a lot to go into this in terms of how you as a child worked?    Mr. MacKenzie: Yes, definitely.    Ms. Williams: Were there many hardships in your own family experience?    Mr. MacKenzie: Well, we were short of money. It took me two years to complete my freshman year. I worked two years as a shellfisherman. In fact, I worked on boat during one fall. I went to college two spring semesters to get through freshman year.    Ms. Williams: So you were supporting yourself to go through school?    Mr. MacKenzie: No, my family paid most, but I earned a lot of it by working in the summer hard-shell clamming and soft-shell clamming.    Ms. Williams: You've lived in New Jersey since 1973. What have you seen in terms of positive or negative changes in Monmouth County environmentally, community wise, socially. Any insight in terms of changes?    Mr. MacKenzie: I don't see anything negative here in the community. Everything's pretty staid. I see an older woman next door about every five years. She says there was a film done about Red Bank in the 1933, as a matter of fact I have it. I bought it because I wanted to see what life was like about the time I was born. She said the town looks the same now as it did then. Same houses, including this house here. There are very little changes as far as actual buildings. There's been more build up along the shore though  a lot more apartment buildings in the last twenty-five years or so.    Ms. Williams: So actually she didn't feel too much of the change.    Mr. MacKenzie: No, Red Bank looks about the same as it did then.    Ms. Williams: Well, it seems that you are someone very appropriate for this research of the Millennium, because you've done so much in terms of providing research about the fisheries and the Highlands, and Atlantic Highlands, and Keyport, and you have a lot to add to this archival collection for this Oral History project. Are there any particular insights or messages that you'd like to make sure are included? Any message to our future generations that may come out of your work or your living?    Mr. MacKenzie: People say, "You're just interested in the commercial fisheries around here  what about the environment?" I asked the head of the American Littoral Society, "Are you interested in keeping these fisheries going?" Well, he thinks as I do, that commercial fisheries were the first industry in the United States, and we should try to keep them going. I don't want them to die out.    Ms. Williams: That's certainly a wonderful mission, and also many families have built their traditions and futures on commercial fishing, and it's very painful to see it die out. It should be preserved as much as possible.    Mr. MacKenzie: The hard-clam fishery in Sea Bright and Highlands is now one of the most prosperous fisheries going in the Eastern United States. The fisherman come from the local areas, but also farther south. They drive up here from Brick and other towns down that way. We're trying very hard to keep that going. In fact, another fellow and I just came up with an important observation: Hard clam fishing has erupted here during the last ten years, and we're trying to figure out why. It turns out that starfish disappeared about the time it erupted, and starfish prey on the juvenile clams. The same thing happened in Connecticut. I was in Connecticut and went out on a boat up there, and this man said, "The clams here, they're spread out way farther then they ever used to be." And I said, "There's got to be a predator missing here, something died out." And I didn't think of starfish at the time, but the same thing happened here. It turns out that starfish died out in Connecticut also.    Ms. Williams: It's so intricate how everything connects, and that you need to know one thing to understand the other.    Mr. MacKenzie: We wrote an article in the Asbury Park Press, saying that if we want to save this clam fishing we're going to have to control the starfish. We have another thing going this winter. Environmentalists over in Staten Island convinced the State to stop blue crab dredging in the wintertime over in Staten Island, because they say that the dredging harms the invertebrates on the bottom, reducing their abundance. But they didn't have any data on it at all. They've been dredging for well over a hundred and fifty years or so, used to do it with sailboats, schooners, and sloops. The same folks who harvested and farmed oysters, used to dredge these crabs in the wintertime. So this winter we want to have an experiment to find out if the dredging actually does reduce the abundance of vertebrates. I doubt it does.    Ms. Williams: It's exciting to do applied research that you know is going to help quality of life.    Mr. MacKenzie: We like immediate results, and I hope we can get the law changed immediately.    Ms. Williams: People have to trust people's vision.    Mr. MacKenzie: I'm trying to think ahead all the time. We're asked to get involved in gear effects. What effects do gear like the surf clam dredge have on the environment? Another thing we're doing right now, in fact we want to pack some samples tomorrow, is the effect of hand raking on clams on the habitat.    Ms. Williams: This has been a very informative interview for me, and I'm sure the listeners and readers will find this extremely educational. Anything else you'd like to add before we close?    Mr. MacKenzie: I'm a familiar figure around here. I walk into Red Bank almost every day. People see me walking and they say, "Oh, I see you are walking again." I try to keep myself going and active by exercise. You asked about the other changes. I notice the turn-over in the ownership of stores in Red Bank has been proceeding at an accelerated rate.    Ms. Williams: Absolutely. Well, you've certainly contributed a lot by improving conditions and living conditions through your research, and Monmouth County's glad to have you here.    Mr. MacKenzie: Well, it seems like you work and work and there's no result from it, but I guess there probably is some. Somebody said, "Clyde, you write so much. You publish and you publish." Seems to me I work a lot at writing, but I infrequently see it come out.    Ms. Williams: One thing is that you will never know fully all of the people reading and utilizing it. That's being the author. You can't necessarily know what people will be implementing suggestions in your writing.    Mr. MacKenzie: I estimate ten people around the world will read one of my papers.    Ms. Williams: That's ten more communities that are being helped. Thank you so much, Clyde, for your time in this project. I know that the reader and listener will benefit a great deal from your knowledge. so thank you again for giving your time for this.    Mr. MacKenzie: You're welcome.   
MonmouthCounty;Mary Jane Schwartz;1915;2000;Mary Jane Schwartz, 1915, 2000          Remembering The 20th Century: An Oral History of Monmouth County      Mary Jane Schwartz (right) with her sister, Ruth  Date of Interview: March 30, 2000  Name of Interviewer: Rhoda Newman  Premises of Interview: Ms. Schwartz's home, Ocean Grove, NJ  Birthdate of subject: November 19, 1915    Ms. Schwartz: My name is Mary Jane Schwartz and as indicated, I was born November 19, 1915 in this house here at 72 1/2 Embury Avenue. According to what I have been told, I am the youngest of six children. My parents came from Philadelphia in about 1902 and rented this house. They rented it until 1922, when they purchased it. So that means that the Schwartz family has been living in the same house for close to one hundred years. Before that, my grandmother had a summer rooming house, a boarding house I guess you would call it, on Heck Avenue. She first came to Ocean Grove  sometime in the 1870s, about 1877 or 1878. She operated that rooming house or boarding house for about thirty years until her death, before I was born in about 1913. Although I never had any connection with the Olive House, which was the name of the operation, I heard a lot about it growing up because my older sisters used to spend summers there. They knew my grandmother and a couple of aunts, which I never had the privilege of doing, because they were all dead before I was born. So I grew up here with four sisters and one brother. My sister Edna was the oldest. After she married, she lived in Philadelphia, and we used to visit her. I had a sister Minerva, who married, and she lived in Ocean Grove in an apartment on Main Avenue above the Acme Store. The Gannons have their office in that building now. Then when my parents purchased the house here in about 1922, Minerva and her husband moved into the other half of the house, because it was a double house. They occupied that half of the house until their death. Minerva died in 1969 and at that time, we inherited the other half of the house. Well, that's why we have the house now. Then I have a sister Clara. Minerva taught over in Bradley Park School, which is part of the Neptune Township school system. Our sister Clara taught in the Bradley Beach Grammar School. I guess about 1938, sometime around that, she married and moved to Allentown, New Jersey. That just left Ruth, myself, and Bill at home. Bill is our brother William. Then Bill married in the early 1940s and he stayed in Ocean Grove. He lived up the street from us on New Jersey Avenue in a small house. After they were there for five or six years or more, they moved to a larger house on New Jersey Avenue, which they occupied until 1999 when they sold it and moved to Arkansas to be near their daughter. But anyway to get back to the beginning, we attended school at the Neptune Township school system. We walked to school every morning, came home at noontime, went back for the afternoon session, and walked back home again. Maybe that's why we are healthy, because we got plenty of exercise when we were young, in all kinds of weather. If the weather was very threatening...rain or stormy, the school system would have what they called a half-session and school was let out about 12:30 p.m. and we didn't have to go back in the afternoon. Across the street from the school building was the motion picture theatre called The Main Street.    Ms. Newman: Where was the school located?    Ms. Schwartz: Right here at the gate where the building is now...Neptune Township High School.    Ms. Newman: It is the same building as the High School?    Ms. Schwartz: Yes. The Grammar School was generally on the first floor and then as the attendance grew larger and larger, they acquired the annex and built a gymnasium in the annex, as well as additional schoolrooms for the Grammar School. But the High School continued to stay in that large, brick building. In the beginning, it was big enough to take care of both the grammar and high schools. We all graduated from that school, accept my sister Edna, our oldest sister. She didn't graduate. She left the school and went to work at Steinbachs in Asbury Park. She was quite pleased with herself that she worked there and that she was in the jewelry department, which was the prestigious department to work in. She worked there until she married and moved to Philadelphia.    Ms. Newman: Now Ocean Grove was founded in 1869, is that right?    Ms. Schwartz: Yes.    Ms. Newman: Did you know any of the original pioneers...the old settlers? Were they still around?    Ms. Schwartz: No, we didn't. They might have been around, but they were such old fogies that we didn't know them. But I would easily say that our grandmother did, and I know my father might have mentioned them. In fact, when my father was growing up, of course he came with his mother as a child, he knew the Lillegards. They had a son named Nelson, and Nelson and my father were very friendly to the extent that my brother's middle name is Nelson, named after our father's friend, Nelson Lillegard. They had the pavilion at the south end, I believe it was. But we didn't know them, and I think that one of them, Osborne, had a house on the back street. That's the only thing I remember hearing about them, but they were long gone by the 1920s when we were old enough to understand.    Ms. Newman: Were the streets were still unpaved when you were growing up?    Ms. Schwartz: Yes, the streets were unpaved. They went over them with a water wagon. Then they put something down...some kind of white stuff which was supposed to keep the dust down. Not only did the water wagon go by, but in the summertime we had the ice wagon, the iceman. A huckster would come every summer. In fact Schank was the name of one of the hucksters that I think went to school with my sister Minerva, because she seemed to know him. There were hucksters that went by.    Ms. Newman: Fruits and vegetables?    Ms. Schwartz: Fresh fruit and vegetables. You didn't have a supermarket like we have now. They had fish wagons, too. And then all these people, when we were kids growing up, would come to the back door. You'd get a brick of margarine that looked like lard, with a capsule that you'd have to squeeze to make it orange. There used to be old farmers that would come in from the Farmingdale and Freehold area in the fall with apples and things like that.    Ms. Newman: What about things like chickens and eggs?      G. William and Mary D. Schwartz, 1944  Ms. Schwartz: Well, there were a couple of butcher shops and they had eggs at the grocery store. We would go around to Main Avenue every Friday. My mother would make out a list of things she needed from the market and she'd give it to my father because he worked at Ernest N. Wilston's Real Estate & Insurance Office on Main Avenue. He went right by the A&P on his way to work. When he came home for lunch on Friday, she'd give him the basket and the list and he'd drop it off at the store. When he came home at five o'clock, he'd stop in the store and pick up the basket of groceries/supplies almost like these 'westerners' that would go to town. The hucksters didn't come around in the wintertime because there wasn't the population to support their little vegetable business, besides the fact that fresh vegetables weren't even available then like they are nowadays. These people, I remember, did come around to the back door. There was a store owner, Titian Summers, whose store was on Heck Avenue next to the butcher shop there. He used to come and get orders, and of course the milkman would come and leave the milk. In the wintertime, you know, the cream would freeze at the top of the bottle. In the summertime, we would have lots of company. I wouldn't say 'lots' of company, but we had our share of company coming down from the city, from Philadelphia, because that's where our cousins and remaining family lived. They would come to Aunt Mary and Uncle Will's house and would be here for maybe the weekend or for longer periods of time. Of course we had the third floor with accommodations that could sleep extra people. What they wanted when they came to the shore, of course, was dinner. And the menu that we had was always very good, and they never got tired of it. I know I never got tired of it. We always had a big fish, either a huge bluefish or bonito. My mother would bake it and make a dressing and put in, and we used to kind of fight over the little pieces of bacon that she'd put on the top. It was so nice and crisp and brown. These were nice, fresh fish that you either got around at the fish market or from the fish man who came through the streets. My mother was a pretty good cook, and she always made a lemon meringue pie for dessert.    Ms. Newman: My mouth is watering!    Ms. Schwartz: (Laughter) And you know, this was sort of an old-fashioned family. My father was born the same year that Ocean Grove was established, in July 1869. My mother was born in November 1870. So they were brought up by Victorian parents, and that brushed off onto us, too. You know, you pass these things on to the next generation, knowingly or unknowingly. And so we were all taught how to be conservative and how to do things...how to clean corn, how to shell peas, and how to shell lima beans. Lima beans, heaven for bid! They used to be devils to shell. But this was the way you bought stuff from the huckster, and you had to shell your own stuff.    Ms. Newman: So what else did you have with your fish dinner?    Ms. Schwartz: Well, we probably had potatoes and whatever vegetables that were available, probably fresh corn or peas, or whatever was on the wagon that day. My mother would bake bread, rolls, and cinnamon buns. Coming from Philadelphia, we were partial to sticky buns, and she made sticky buns.    Ms. Newman: Were all you girls taught to cook?      From left: Ruth, age 11  Mary Jane, age 5  Bill, age 7, 1920  Ms. Schwartz: Well, Ruth was, and Edna was the good cook. I never was much of a cook. Clara was a pretty good cook. I didn't cook because when I got to the cooking stage, Ruth was home to do the cooking and I was off working because for thirty years...well, we won't get to that yet. We're still talking about this other stuff. As I say, we all went to Neptune...the sisters, the brother, the whole bunch of us. Five of us graduated from Neptune High School although Minerva and Edna started their education in Philadelphia because they were born in the 1890s and the rest of us started in Neptune. So what we know today is what we learned at Neptune High School, whether that's good or bad. Minerva was born in 1892, Edna was born in 1891, and Clara was born in 1900. They say that Clara was two years old when they came to Ocean Grove, so that's what we use as our numbering business. If she was two when they came, it was 1902. We don't know what time of the year it was. It was Christmas, and she was born in November, so it was late in the year. That was all before our time. We're sort of spread out, our family. We had three older sisters and then the three younger...Ruth in 1909, Bill in 1913 and me in 1915.    Ms. Newman: Did you travel outside of Ocean Grove? Did you go back to Philadelphia?    Ms. Schwartz: Yes, to see my father's aunt, Aunt Ella. We don't know too much about the Mager family, my Grandmother Mager. My Grandmother Schwartz's name was Mary Elizabeth Mager, and I don't know why we don't know too much about her.     Ms. Newman: How is that spelled?    Ms. Schwartz: M-a-g-e-r was my mother's maiden name. We don't know too much about them...the generation before, you know. As far as I understand, the Schwartz family came to the country about 1836. I think it was Michael or somebody by the name of Schwartz arrived in Philadelphia.    Ms. Newman: Where did he come from originally?    Ms. Schwartz: He came from Germany, I think. He was a baker, and he had a bakery, I imagine, in Philadelphia. He had a lot of kids, and amongst them was my grandfather, who married Mary Elizabeth Montgomery. The family hero is Uncle Charlie, who was one of my grandfather's brother. He was a Captain in some Philadelphia regiment during the Civil War. He served in that Army: I guess he enlisted about 1862. Anyway, he served in the Army at Potomac  that's where his battalion was assigned to. He was at the Battle of Gettysburg and got a wound in his leg, and he was sent home to Philadelphia to recuperate. He rejoined his regiment during the Battle of Wilderness and was killed at the Battle of Spotsylvania Courthouse. One of his sisters went down to Virginia or wherever it was, recovered his body, and brought it back. He was buried in Philadelphia. We had a portrait of him that my Aunt Ella, which was another sister of his, had at her house. When she passed away at the age of ninety-eight, for some reason we got the picture. I don't know why...there was some kind of family business. Somebody else, another of our cousins, got a lot of Aunt Ella's belongings and we got Uncle Charlie's picture and a couple of other little things. That's neither here nor there. But there again, this was my father's aunt, and she lived to be ninety-eight, which was considerable when you figure she was born way back in the 1830s.    Ms. Newman: You come from good stock.    Ms. Schwartz: Yes. As I say, that's the Schwartz family, but I don't know too much about the Montgomery family. The only thing we know about them is that her father was a carpenter.    Ms. Newman: Did you travel outside of the state?    Ms. Schwartz: Yes. I went to overseas twice, and I went to England and Paris. I have been on an Elder Hostel just to England and Scotland, and I've been to Mexico. When we got a car, we used to go all over the East Coast, up and down the East Coast.    Ms. Newman: When did you get a car?    Ms. Schwartz: I got a car in 1951, and we started going to Williamsburg and took Minerva and Edna. We were interested in history, you know, maybe because there was something about the Civil War that my mother and father were always interested in. You see, they heard so much about that when they were growing up. My Grandfather Mager was in the Civil War. He went to all these encampments...Grand Army Republic had encampments and he'd bring back little things for us granddaughters. Edna and Minerva got little spoons and pictures that say Gettysburg or someplace else...wherever the encampment was held. Of course Uncle Charlie having been the hero at Spotsylvania Courthouse, my father had that instinct. My mother wanted to go to Spotsylvania Courthouse, and one time Edna and Frank, who was my sister's husband, went down to Virginia and went all through that area like Chancellorsville, Spotsylvania Courthouse, and all those little places. We belong to the Daughters of the American Revolution, and we know a lot about what went on in New Jersey during the Revolutionary War. We know what went on in the Philadelphia area because our ancestor through my mother's line. His name was Anthony Hoover  he was a Quaker and a member of a band and served in the Army Band. So we have all that background stuff. I've been to Gettysburg I don't know how many times, we've been to all these places in Virginia, to Williamsburg about half a dozen or more times, to New England I don't know how many times, to Canada and also out to Illinois, and to Lincoln country. We haven't been much beyond the Mississippi River.    Ms. Newman: Essentially you've lived most of your life in Ocean Grove but you would travel elsewhere.    Ms. Schwartz: Yes, that's right. These were vacations.    Ms. Newman: You graduated from elementary school and went on to high school?    Ms. Schwartz: Yes. We don't have anything higher than a high school education, Ruth and I. Of course Minerva and Clara went to Trenton State, two years at that time, to become teachers. That was all that was required of them. Well, I did graduate from high school and then went to the business school in Newark for several months...I forget how long. I remember commuting on the train. Eventually along came Word War II, and I was employed at Fort Monmouth where I worked for thirty years. I had enough sick leave piled up that they gave me credit for thirty one years, which made it nice to have an extra year on my severance pay as far as that goes.    Ms. Newman: How did you get to Fort Monmouth?    Ms. Schwartz: At the beginning I carpooled...I went with somebody and when it was necessary, I'd have to go on the bus. You could go to Asbury and get the bus there.    Ms. Newman: What did you do there?    Ms. Schwartz: Well, for eighteen years, I guess it was, I worked as a clerk typist in the procurement department. For the remaining twelve years, because of the civil service requirements you can get bumped and there are changes and stuff like that, I worked in the motor transportation department. I couldn't wait to get out of the place because it was a dead-end job. I took the early retirement that they offered. I was the right age and I had the right number of years of service.      Four of the six Schwartz siblings in 1993. From left: Clara, Ruth, Bill, and Mary Jane. Not pictured: Edna. Deceased: Minerva  Ms. Newman: When did you retire?    Ms. Schwartz: I retired in 1970 or 1971. I've been retired now almost as long as I worked.    Ms. Newman: Sounds as though you don't lack for things to do.    Ms. Schwartz: That's right. I'm not sorry. I don't think my brother, at that time, was very happy with the fact that I was retiring at the age of fifty five. After that, for a couple of years, I did volunteer work but for some reason I didn't like it. Maybe I had picked the wrong fields, I don't know. I didn't like it. So for five summers I worked as a cashier down at the theatre at the north end of Ocean Grove. And then that closed and I....    Ms. Newman: When did that close?    Ms. Schwartz: I don't know when that closed. They pulled down the hotel, you know, and they tore it down.    Ms. Newman: People have such happy memories of the north end.    Ms. Schwartz: Oh, yes. It was fun out there. The job was confining though, because it was six days per week with no days off except Sunday. You had to be there every day in the afternoon for the matinee and in the evening for the evening show.    Ms. Newman: Did you get to see the pictures?    Ms. Schwartz: Well, I got passes for the rest.(Llaughter) If I wanted to see a picture, the box office didn't close until after the main feature came on, and you always kind of missed the first ten minutes or something like that. Every night you had to close out your tickets and count your money and make sure everything was ok.    Ms. Newman: Were these shows pretty much sold out in the summer?    Ms. Schwartz: Well, it all depends. What was interesting to me was they always had three different pictures every week...three different features per week. On Monday, or whenever the new picture was shown, people would come to the first day because if they liked the film, they would come back and see it again...particularly in the afternoon when the prices were lower. When I first started it was like fifty cents, and then it was seventy-five cents for the matinee. Then the prices went up over that period of five years. My bosses, Jack and Loretta Houston, were nice to work with. They really lived in that theatre from the time it opened in June until it closed in September. They had to be there more or less all day to see that things were in order and to be there when the films were delivered and all that stuff. They changed the pictures in the showcases and all that stuff. It was an experience.    Ms. Newman: What were some of the big hits of the day?    Ms. Schwartz: Well, there was the Poseidon Adventure and one year they had a picture about, I forget what the name of it was, but it was the story of the great Norwegian composer. It had such beautiful music in it...the soundtrack was terrific. That was very popular, and they'd have that almost every year. Towards the end of the season, they didn't seem to have too much luck because people went home around Labor Day. People used to go home earlier, and by Labor Day, it was time to close up. But it's not like that anymore. It would always close the following Saturday, and by that time people had gone home and there weren't too many people around. But it was fun.    Ms. Newman: What was the population here when you were growing up and how did it expand in the summer? Did it double?    Ms. Schwartz: Oh, I'm sure it would double. It would triple probably. When we were living here on this block, how many houses were occupied in the wintertime? (note: question asked to her sister, I believe) There were about seven or eight...on this particular block...on both sides of the street.    Ms. Newman: So, there were a lot of summer homes.    Ms. Schwartz: That's why when these people buy these houses today, they weren't built for year-round. This house...we can remember that behind this wall here are pocket doors, and in the dining room there was a pot-bellied stove. There was a hole in the ceiling, and the only room upstairs that had any heat was the middle bedroom. That's where the stove was. There was no central heat in the house.    Ms. Newman: So how did you manage in the wintertime?    Ms. Schwartz: Well, we had a stove in the kitchen and a stove there (pointed to another room). We had nice quilts on the bed to keep us warm at night. I think we had hot and cold running water. But, you know, it was just very primitive.      Mary Jane Schwartz's home, 72 1/2 Embury Avenue, Ocean Grove  Ms. Newman: But it was what you were used to.    Ms. Schwartz: But that was the way we were brought up. We didn't know anything different. Besides that, after all, we had been through the Depression. Hard times came to the Philadelphia  family...they lost their business and had to give up their home. So where did they wind up? Right here at 72 1/2 Embury Avenue. Fortunately we had the third floor, and there was room for them to sleep. There was no heat, but we had plenty of blankets and stuff, and we survived, and they did too. Unfortunately, they are all dead now. My brother-in-law worked for the C.C.C...some kind of public works.    Ms. Newman: Civilian Conservation Corps?    Ms. Schwartz: Yes. But then his health went bad on him. He had cancer of the lung and was in the hospital. It was unfortunate, but they didn't have a cure for the cancer, and the operations weren't as successful as they are today. So, he died. My father, having worked for a real estate business, knew the people who owned the house across the street at 69 Embury Avenue. My sister Edna, a widow at that time, operated that. It was a little income for her. She and her daughter worked over there for a couple of years, and then Edna got a job as a housekeeper/companion for a doctor in Hightstown. From then on, she worked as a companion. She had a job in Hightstown, in Bayonne, Allentown, and Ocean Grove. You know Davison Rugs?    Ms. Newman: Oh, yes.    Ms. Schwartz: They needed a housekeeper/companion for their mother, and Edna was a good one to have because Edna knew how to clean, how to cook, and was a good person to have around...an older person, too, as far as that goes. So, that's what Edna did. After she worked there, she also worked in the factory over in Bradley Beach. There was a clothing factory there that she worked in. As I say, we had the Depression but we didn't know anything about it. We never missed a meal. It might not have been a fancy one, but we never missed a meal. Our older sisters were handy with a needle, and they made dresses for us. We went around to Clayton Store on Main Avenue, of course the entrance was on Main Avenue, and we just scooted around and went in the back entrance. They had plenty of calico at Clayton's. We knew the clerks by name, and they knew us because we were there all the time. I remember at the back of the store where you went in, I suppose it's the kitchen now for those restaurants that are in the same building, there was a big, barn-like place where they sold rugs and linoleum. When you went in the back entrance, you'd have that nice smell because it was different. It probably wasn't good for your lungs, but it was ok. Then in the back where you went through the little entrance, sort of like a doorway or archway, they had a little table where they would have the remnants. Every time I went in there, I used to straighten out the remnants. There were two clerks that used to be there...two ladies. One was Miss Crevatt and Harding was the other lady's name. They were there for years and years. In the film Gone With the Wind, there is a scene where Scarlett is in Atlanta, and she is in some scene. In that scene there is a big sort of cabinet where they kept spool thread. They had one exactly like that at C.C. Clayton's. I wonder whatever happened to that? It probably got thrown out. It was a big cabinet, and you'd pull your thread out the bottom.      Various toys  Ms. Newman: What did you do for fun when you were growing up?    Ms. Schwartz: Oh, my goodness. We were taught to sew, and during the summertime, we never missed a day at the beach when the weather was good. My sister, Minerva, lived next door. Clara was off someplace...she was either taking a course in summer school, to the World's Fair in Chicago, or somewhere. She went to Europe one summer, too.    Ms. Newman: That was adventurous in those days! Did you have bathhouses?    Ms. Schwartz: We had a bathhouse at south end. You could rent a bathhouse for fifteen dollars for the whole season. We had a set of towels that we saved from summer to summer that was for the bathhouse. When they got too dirty and smelly, we would bring them home and wash them and take them back down.    Ms. Newman: So you did all of your laundry here? Sheets and everything?    Ms. Schwartz: Oh, yes. The one extravagance that we had was a wash lady that came in every Monday and helped my mother do the washing. If it was a rainy day, we had nail holes in the kitchen where they would hang a line up and the stuff would be hung up in the kitchen to dry. Then we got a washer and the wash lady didn't come anymore. She was a colored lady and lived over in Asbury, and she used to eat starch. I remember that...she used to eat starch. We didn't go to the summer programs for some reason or other. We didn't go to them, and I can never quite figure out why. My friends would go to those programs...I mean the daily ones like Bible School and the young people's... I think my mother thought that we got enough of that at home. We had a piano, and I took piano lessons. We had a radio with a battery, and the battery only worked so many days or months before it had to be recharged. You know, all those things. During the war, we were rationed. We still have the old ration books up on that shelf in the kitchen in that cabinet. Of course, we went to school. Where my father worked was next to the Ocean Grove Times. Every now and then, there was some kind of report that had to come out and had to be folded. He would bring home stacks of paper that we would all have to sit around the table and fold for the Ocean Grove Times.    Ms. Newman: That was when there was an extra edition?    Ms. Schwartz: No, not necessarily the newspaper, but a printing job. They did reports for the Methodist Home, for the Association I guess, and they did have other printing jobs. Those are the things we would have to fold. We would sit around and play games like cards other and games, and we had plenty of stuff to do. We sewed and embroidered, and we played with dolls. We had friends that would come in, you know. We had this third floor, and we had clothes where we would play dress-up. If we could only have those clothes now, they would probably be worth something! My father's domain was in the cellar. He had a jigsaw, and he made jigsaw puzzles and all kinds of things. During the Depression, we used to rent out puzzles. He would paste the picture on wood, and he would draw all the little figures like animal figures, etc. Then he would cut them out, and the puzzle part would be all around these animals. And he had such a stack of them that we had a little puzzle-renting business.    Ms. Newman: Your father was always in the real estate business and knew everyone in town, I take it?    Ms. Schwartz: He knew everyone in town, and everyone in town knew him. When he passed away, we got cards and condolences from people we didn't even know. They knew him and had written lovely little notes about how kind and gentle he was...so he was a very, nice person. To me, the only one who seemed to have his qualities was Minerva. Clara was bossy. Edna was very self-centered, I thought. You see we can say these things now because they're not around. But Minerva was very kind and gentle. You could go and talk to her like you could go and talk to my father. People would come, and they would talk to Minerva. There was just something about her that was like "counseling"...that you could talk with and discuss things with her and you would know it would go no further. Clara was very bossy, but she was good in her way. She was good to us, too. When they lived in Allentown, we could drive there before my brother was married, because he had a car. He would drive out there in the evening, when we could get the gas because it was wartime, when Clara was living out there. We could drive there and once in awhile, my father and mother stayed over night at Clara's. They would take her out. Of course Clara and Harold would come down here, too. They'd bring friends from Allentown and they'd be here for supper. When they came from Allentown, they always brought nice peaches or something. Harold had a half-acre of asparagus, and during asparagus season, we had it until it came out our ears! But it was delicious, fresh grown. He sold his asparagus at the farmer's market in Hightstown and raised it as a cash crop. That was the only crop he had because he was in the ice business. He had an ice route in, I guess you would call it upper Freehold township area, because Allentown is there. We would go there in the evening...having these older sisters, it was kind of interesting. Their friends would come here, and we were little kids. We were the younger generation, because there was a ten-year gap or more. We knew their friends, and then we had our friends. And our friends knew them, you know, because of the ages. To this day there is only one person that we know that is alive who was a friend of Clara, and that is Helen Strudwick. We just saw her a few weeks ago at the church for the Lenten Journey. We see her every year, and it's nice to see her. Of course she's an old lady now, but we still see her. She is able to be out, which is great. She must be...Clara would be ninety-nine this year, and Helen could be one or two years younger than Clara, as far as that goes. But they taught school together in Bradley Beach. They had a card club, you know, and we had to scamper out of sight then. We weren't supposed to be around when the teachers were here. We either had to go to bed early or go someplace else. My goodness, we went to the movies all the time. They had double features in those days. The best thing about the Main Street theatre was that they had vaudeville. This was in the twenties, you know. They still had vaudeville at that theatre, so that was great. We went over in Asbury to the Savoy, where they had a stock company. Once in awhile, we would go to plays there. I mean, we weren't denied anything. We went to Philadelphia...we went to the Centennial in 1926. There was some kind of Centennial in 1926. Coming from Philadelphia, we used to get our best clothes there. Aunt Ella lived on 21st Street and Spring Garden, and when we went to Edna's house, she lived on Fairmount Avenue between 17th and 18th Street. You just had to walk down Fairmount Avenue to 21st Street, past the prison, and go over to.... Aunt Ella was deaf as a doornail. You almost had to write her a note to tell her when you were coming so she would let you in. Her hearing was bad, but I guess her health was pretty good. She had one son, cousin James, who I do not remember. This is the tail end of this family, you know. We have one niece now, and she has one son. But we are really whittling down to nothing.    Ms. Newman: Was there a great change when the chains came down from the gate...was in 1969 or so?    Ms. Schwartz: Well, a lot of people were upset about that. At certain times, I am too. It came to the point, however, that you couldn't avoid it. It was in 1979, and I faithfully parked my car outside the gate, although some people were beginning to park their cars on Sunday before that fateful day when they finally opened the gate. It got to the point where... I used to rent a spot... There used to be a garage over in Asbury Park on Lake Avenue. I had a rental place there for I don't know how many years. Needing my car on Monday morning to go to work, I had to be sure that it was going to be there and that I could get it started. The weather was bad. It used to be worse in those days. We used to have more storms and if it was too bad, they didn't even do anything about the streets. I was able to park the car there on my way home from work and then walk over the bridge and come home.    Ms. Newman: Did they have snowplows?    Ms. Schwartz: Yes, but they didn't do the stuff like they do now. They didn't do it like they do now because they didn't need to, since there weren't many cars around. They just made a path in the middle, practically. The Association had a little snowplow in the twenties. It was a horse-drawn plow, and they used to do the sidewalks. But still in the 1950s and 1960s, and a lot of people used another garage. I used this one here because I felt it was better for me. So, I used to keep my car in the garage over there, but parked in front of the house during the week. On weekends, you couldn't find a place to park your car. If you went out on Sunday, it meant you might not have a place to park your car when you came back, even if it was Asbury Park or someplace else. I don't have anything to say about the Association because they didn't have any property in Asbury Park and didn't have any property in Bradley Beach for us to park our cars. Where they had property in Ocean Grove, they weren't inviting you to park your car.    Ms. Newman: But once the chains came down, was the parking situation better?    Ms. Schwartz: The first time I parked my car, they were having a St. Patrick's Day Parade or something in Belmar. We walked out of Ocean Grove to get our car parked over there in Asbury Park, and on the way we could count four or five cars that had parked in Ocean Grove. And the gates weren't open yet, but there was a way to get in. Technically, they weren't open. So we went out and on the way home I said, "The heck with this...I'm going to park my car in Ocean Grove." It was March 17, 1979, which was the first Sunday I parked my car in Ocean Grove. By that time I was sick and tired of this and I had only been doing it for twenty-five years, but there were people who had been doing it for even longer lengths of time. I decided that next to your house, your car is the biggest piece of property you own. Why should you be denied the use of it fifty-two days per year? People used to park their car on Thursday. Can you imagine that if they had a special place they wanted to park their car that they would park their car on Thursday just to get that spot? I couldn't understand that. And then the cars would be vandalized and it got to the point where Bradley Beach complained. In the summertime there was always a commotion going on because people would park their cars in front of driveways in Bradley Beach. Asbury Park was up-and-coming yet, and you couldn't find a place to park in Asbury. Well, anyway...parking just got to be impossible. I forget what happened, but the garage closed down, so I no longer kept my car in a garage. So I was like everybody else and joined the people and went out as early on Saturday as I could to get a place to park. Now when I was working at the Strand, I would park my car when I went to work on Saturday. Instead of walking down there, I would park the car in Asbury and walk from there. I was pretty lucky then because it was early on Saturday and you could get a place in the Press Plaza, which was a good place to park your car. Sunday night if you stayed up and went to get your car, it was gridlock to get into Ocean Grove. But generally I would wait until Monday morning and just walk out and go to work. And then I'd like to say something about the Depression. Everybody had their stories about the Depression. Times were definitely hard. In Neptune Township they ran out of money, and some of the officials...instead of paying cash, they got script. That was kind of tough, because not everybody would accept script in payment, you know what I mean. Of course the banks closed. The bank in Ocean Grove closed. I didn't have any bank account yet, but I know of people who did and they were lucky if they got their money.    Ms. Newman: Were there homeless people in those days?    Ms. Schwartz: Not like there is today...not here.    Ms. Newman: Did they have family or church that would take care of them?    Ms. Schwartz: Well, there wasn't the population here. They were tough times. Of course, there were always colored people who were working for peanuts, you know. I forget how much we paid Edna, if we even paid her a dollar for a day's work. But it wasn't like it is today. People were different than the generation we have now. I think our generation had a little more pride, and they took more interest in doing things for themselves. And then of course with the rationing, it was a little tough getting enough sugar. You were only allowed one pair of shoes a year or something like that. Of course we went to Asbury Park, the dime stores, Steinbachs, Lemaisters, Tuckers, and all those stores there. We had a neighbor who lived two houses down and she worked in a store. I remember going into the store because she made hats and decorated them. She looked like she had palsy because she was making little, tiny stitches in the ribbon to make a ruffle or something like that. I remember thinking that if I could ever make stitches like that, oh my goodness. They were so even. We would go to the same shops in Asbury. Steinbachs, of course, was the star store. They had everything there...toys, yard goods, fur coats and everything. Fatty McGill's sister was Mamie McGill, and she worked in the stocking department. One of the policemen who used to be in Ocean Grove was Fatty McGill. They called him this because he was sort of portly. He was one of the Ocean Grove policemen  he lived there two houses east of us, Police Chief Franklin lived two houses west of us. There were more people living on this side (south side) of the street on this block. The summer people would come every year, and we still call houses by their original owners. Across the street there used to be a hotel on the corner that was torn down and two new houses built there.     Ms. Newman: But the same summer people would come here year after year?    Ms. Schwartz: The same summer people more or less. There's a rooming house across the street. Oh this is interesting! That rooming house at 69 was one time operated by people by the name of Crooks in Trenton, and their son was one of the officers here named Richard Crooks. He used to come and visit his father, and of course his father was always playing one of Richard Crooks' records. He was always screaming out the door, "Oh, sweet mystery of life." We had people by the name of Pigueron. They were summer people and rented a house on this block. Well, we became very friendly with them, and one of their daughters, Mary, was a Salvationist. Through Mary, we became friendly with another Salvationist called Alma Warth. When they were on vacation from New York, Alma would stay here, and Alma's sisters were also Salvationists. Once in awhile, the sisters would stay here too. I remember every time that they came, I don't know if they paid my mother or anything like that, but they got their meals here. They used to bring a package of candy from Loft's. There were two or three boxes of candy from Loft's. That used to be wonderful. For five dollars you could go on the bus to New York and you could get a ticket for a theatre show. First you would pick out what you think you wanted to see, and you'd go to the theatre and get your ticket. It would probably be in the balcony, but that was all right. Then you could go someplace for lunch, and you would have about $1.50 left to maybe go to Kresges to buy some little thing or if you had a list of things you wanted to buy, you had extra money to get it.    Ms. Newman: All this for five dollars?    Ms. Schwartz: Yes, because the bus was only $1.25, and you could get a ticket to the theatre for $1.50. Buses were only $1.25 to go to New York round-trip. The trains were around before the bus system began operation. Of course on the bus, it took you forever to get to New York, because it was before the highways were built, and you went through South Amboy, through Elizabeth, the Holland tunnel, etc. But then the trains would have excursions. We could see Fred Astaire and all these people on the stage. My sister would buy her tickets, and they would be for evening performances, and we would come home on the owl train, which got in to Asbury Park around two o'clock in the morning. You'd walk from the theatres in New York around 42nd or 43rd Street, wherever they were, down to Penn Station and get the train and come home on that. We forgot about Philadelphia because after the Depression, there wasn't any reason to go there. Edna was no longer living there. We would occasionally go to Philadelphia, but not much.    Ms. Newman: Did you hear the performances at The Great Auditorium?    Ms. Schwartz: Well, we would go there too. We'd go there more frequently, now that I think about it. We saw Marion Anderson and we saw Paul Robeson. Then the firemen used to have a night at the Auditorium, and they used to have Graham somebody. And the ushers used to have a program, and we never missed those things. St. Paul's used to have a night at the Auditorium...this is before the beginning of the series of Saturday night stuff.    Ms. Newman: Did you hear speakers at the Auditorium?    Ms. Schwartz: Yes, and that was kind of fascinating. Lowell Thomas was over there and then within days, he passed away. When we were in school, one thing that impressed me that I still think of once in awhile: how fortunate we were to hear Admiral Byrd at the Convention Hall, when he gave a lecture for students. We all went up to the Convention Hall and heard him, and he showed pictures and things. I distinctly remember the long walk home on the boardwalk in Asbury Park. And of course we were in school and heard Sousa's band.    Ms. Newman: Did you hear any of the presidents who were here?    Ms. Schwartz: If I heard any, I was a baby. They stopped coming after awhile. We went around there when Nixon was there, but that was a political rally or campaign. Nixon was actually the only one that we heard at the Auditorium because all those other ones were before my time. I think my father took us around in a baby carriage or something like that to see them, but that's all I remember.    Ms. Newman: And lots of people poured into town for Nixon's address?    Ms. Schwartz: Oh, yes. It was sort of exciting because of all the Secret Servicemen and they set up places for the press, and all that business. They had helicopters come in and all this business for Nixon, and it was exciting.    Ms. Newman: That was in 1970, as I recall.    Ms. Schwartz: That was in the 1970s. I had some slides that I took, but I gave them to the Historical Society. I have some other slides I should give them of pictures I have taken of places that are no longer around. I never was much into photography. We were more interested in handiwork, actually. My father had two sisters, and one was a dressmaker, apparently. She used her hands and things like that, and a cousin Helen who was very good with her hands. She was a good photographer and seamstress. We made doll clothes and cut out paper dolls and did all kinds of stuff...you know, more hand-type stuff. And here we are today. I was going to do several things when I retired. One of them was to bake bread with yeast, so I finally got around to doing it this winter. It didn't turn out too bad for the first time, but it could've been better. And it took me all that time. My mother used to make this good bread, and her sticky buns were terrific. Clara used to make good buns, and Edna used to make excellent buns. So I said, "Why can't I?" I still have to find out if I can.    Ms. Newman: Are there other things that you haven't done that you still want to do?    Ms. Schwartz: Well, I guess about the only thing I still thought I would like to do is to go through the Panama Canal, but that's about the only thing. I had a couple of little things I was going to do and I've accomplished those. I don't know where you get these ideas, but one time I wanted a string of pearls and I got a nice string of pearls that I still have. They were given to me when I graduated from high school, I think, from my parents. I have nothing to complain about. One thing has been fortunate for us. Our niece, when she went to school, went to Indiana and married a young man from there. His first job out of college was in Indiana, and his jobs have always been in the central part of the United States. She has lived in Indiana, Omaha, Nebraska, near Kansas City and St. Louis, and she also has been in Greensburg, Pennsylvania. She has never been back to Ocean Grove, except to visit.    Ms. Newman: Have you been to visit her?    Ms. Schwartz: We visited her in Kansas City, which I thought was a wonderful city. This past fall her son was married, and we went to St. Louis for the wedding. Here's the picture of the bride and groom, my brother, Ruth and myself.    Ms. Newman: Oh, how wonderful. That's in St. Louis. That looks like a house that might have been in Ocean Grove.    Ms. Schwartz: The wedding took place in St. Charles, which is just outside. This is the chapel or the place for marriage that they have. It was really very nice. The wedding took place here, and the reception was also held there. It was like a Mississippi River house, as far as that goes. They finally settled in northwest Arkansas, and we've been there a couple of times. Actually it's on the border of Missouri, and they can go to Eureka Springs for the day. They're about 250 miles from St. Louis.    Ms. Newman: So you've done a fair amount of traveling. When did you first go to Europe?    Ms. Schwartz: I went to Europe with Edith Bradshaw in I think the 1960s. We went on The Queen Mary. She had cousins outside of London, and that was one of the main reasons why we went. She wanted to see her cousins, and she didn't want to go by herself. So I went with her. It was interesting to meet her cousins. They lived in Whimpleton. While we were there, we toured up into Scotland and went over to Dublin, Ireland and down to Ring of Kerry, I think they call it. We went there and then came back again to London to visit her cousins again and then came back on another boat, Queen Elizabeth or Queen Mary. I have the stuff in the cellar. It was about 1992 or something like that, when I went on an elder hostel with Kay Sullivan, a long-time family friend who lived in Bradley Beach. We were in England for three weeks. Then we were in Scotland for a week, and then in London for a week. That was interesting. Of course there again, you have lectures and then they take you on these daily things, and it's very interesting. I really had a great time.    Ms. Newman: When you were a little girl, would you have thought you would have done all of these things?    Ms. Schwartz: Well, you know Clara went all around the area. She didn't stay home.    Ms. Newman: You all have a sense of adventure.    Ms. Schwartz: Yes. After church on Sundays, we'd go someplace for dinner like up to Flemington to the nice Union House and have dinner there, or we'd go to New Town and also New Hope. It was almost like you knew every single storeowner on the street. We used to go there a lot. When I was in high school, my friend Helen lived in Trenton at that time. I could take a train from Asbury Park to Trenton, and she would meet me at the Trenton Station and we'd get on two buses to get to her house in Trenton. Oftentimes she would come down here on the train for weekends because they were only here in the summertime at that time. They only came here in the summertime during that period, and we used to visit back and forth in the winter. Another thing that was kind of cute that we used to do when we were little kids... the train would have Sunday excursions to Asbury Park. My mother used to take us on Sunday over to the train station to watch the people going home on the train. You know, it was something to do.    Ms. Newman: They were people from New York?    Ms. Schwartz: Mostly from New Jersey. Of course every year, some of these companies would have special excursion days and the firm would close down, and they would have an excursion like we would have a Sunday school picnic, you know. We would go someplace like Clark's Landing. Mostly the Sunday school would go to Clark's Landing and a couple of times they went up to Highlands, and we took a boat to New York and back. We did different things like on these Sunday school excursions or took a boat ride in New York Harbor. Of course, we've been to the Statue of Liberty several times. When I worked at Fort Monmouth, they had a boat that they used to use when they had important visitors that would come, and they would take them around different places, particularly New York. A couple of times it wasn't scheduled for anything, so they could use it. I remember we went up to Highlands, and that pier that we had to go on was ready to fall into the ocean. Nevertheless, we went on the boat to the Statue of Liberty, and I thought that was kind of fun. They did go up the East River a ways, but not too far. Then we had to go back home again. But that was an opportunity that we wouldn't have had otherwise. Every Christmas they would decorate Headquarters, the commanding Officer's residence, and the public halls with Christmas decorations, and they needed greens and holly and stuff like that. So where did they get the stuff from? They'd get it from Sandy Hook. They would send a truck from the motorpool, and then they'd come back loaded with holly and greens and stuff like that they used to use to decorate with.       Mary Jane and Minerva Schwartz drying their hair in the backyard, 1942  Ms. Newman: Now you were saying that when you were growing up you did not have a bathroom or a furnace. So tell me how you managed in those days.    Ms. Schwartz: Well, the way we managed was that we had a sink in the kitchen, and I remember Papa used to wash our hair for us. He used to make something out of our hair with soap, and we had laughing, good, funny times with the funny shapes he'd make out of our hair with the soap. He used to wash our hair, and I remember that. But on Saturday, that was the day you got a bath. We still have the basin that we would wash ourselves with at night. But my mother had a big, galvanized tub that she would fill with heated water that was heated on the kitchen stove.    Ms. Newman: The stove was heated with gas?    Ms. Schwartz: No, it was a coal stove. The stove in the dining room was a coal stove, also. It kept the chill out of the house. At night we'd close this room off, because of the sliding doors. We had quilts to keep us warm in the bedrooms upstairs. But as I say, the kitchen door is the same but it had glass in it. I remember a towel went up over the doorway for privacy, and the door was closed. Mother was very Victorian, and we went one at a time, you know, because we had to be separated with two girls and a boy. (laughter) I remember her scrubbing us like we were a dirty spot on the floor. We got scrubbed real good.    Ms. Newman: Then you had an outhouse in the back?    Ms. Schwartz: It was a toilet that was connected to the sewer system.    Ms. Newman: But that was out back?    Ms. Schwartz: That was in the shed, what you would call the shed.    Ms. Newman: But that was not heated?    Ms. Schwartz: No, that wasn't heated, but it was right next to the house and I'm sure there was enough heat that would warm it a little. You had a crank that would turn to flush it, and that was down under the ground somehow or other. Now we have a regular toilet in there. After they bought the house was when the improvements started to be put in. I think the first thing they did was to dig out the cellar and put in heat. And that meant you could have a hot water boiler, too. It was around 1922 that they bought the house. Then beyond that time it had a slant roof, which was very uncomfortable because you were always bumping your head. So, I don't know if they needed a new room or whatever, but they put in dormer windows on the third floor. There were two rooms on the third floor, one large and one small room. At that time, they put dormer windows up there, which makes it very nice. There's no heat up there to this day, but we open the door, and it takes the chill off. Sun comes in there beautifully on a sunny day. At that time, too, they put in a bathroom on the second floor. I guess it was in about 1929 or 1928, some time around that. Up until that time, the heat was coal...a coal furnace. Then the year Lois got married we had the gas heat put in, which was 1968. The coal furnace was taken out, the coal was shoveled out the window, and the coal bin just became another storage area. We have had to replace a couple of motors, but the heater itself has been doing ok. Then of course we've had other improvements. Since we don't move, we change the wallpaper every ten or twelve years. So that's it. This table is a Victorian table, which must have come from Philadelphia. This has been refinished because one of these little spindles and one of the legs was about ready to fall off. These little pom-poms on the bottom were forever falling out. So, this is an antique.    Ms. Newman: These were all family pieces.    Ms. Schwartz: Yes. We don't have any others downstairs but upstairs in our bedrooms, we have some old furniture that must have come from Philadelphia. Ruth has a lovely antique bureau in her room, and that sewing table with those lovely glass handles on it is an antique. In my bedroom, I have a marble-top stand and a wardrobe that have been in the house since the day I was born. Other than that, you have to replace some stuff with modernized stuff. I remember we used to have oak furniture there...a sideboard there with a mirror and little things on the side where you could put stuff like knickknacks. I don't know whatever happened to that furniture, but now we have this furniture. We got this over at Asbury Park at Banker's Furniture Store. We got that in I guess the 1930s. Banker's Furniture is no longer there. There's a big, empty spot now. You see pictures of these communities where they had late 1800 brick buildings with the fancy things over the windows and all. There is only about one left in Asbury Park now, but there used to be a whole block of those. A friend took me there one time, and we went upstairs and there was a Chinese restaurant up there. But anyway, that store is no longer there. You see how Main Street is today...blank. All those little shops that were there, the two theatres, and one in Asbury Park, which was for the colored people, they're all gone. You can't say there wasn't division of the colored people, because there was. They had their own little theatre. As I say, our parents were brought up and weren't highly educated, but they had the advantages of city life. And I think that they wanted us to have it, too. That was available here and was given to us, to the extent that they could afford to give it to us. So, we were fortunate.    Ms. Newman: It sounds as if this house has a lot of happy memories in it.    Ms. Schwartz: Yes. Up on the third floor, we finally found them after we thought we had gotten rid of them, is a box of Christmas tree ornaments and balls. Well, they started having Christmas trees in this family when Edna and Minerva were small. They were born in the 1890s, and they used to put a Christmas tree in one of these corners here. The tree that Papa bought wasn't filled out like he thought it should be because the ceiling was not that high, so some of the branches were cut off the bottom and inserted in the trunk of the tree to make it fuller. And he tacked it up with a string to stabilize it. And we used to sit and play games with the Christmas tree like "I see", where you'd pick out a special ball. You'd describe the colors in the ball, and the people had to guess which one you were thinking of. Well anyway, we had plenty of stuff to do. We had books to read...    Ms. Newman: What were some of your favorite childhood books?    Ms. Schwartz: Well, we had The Bobbsey Twins, and Bill had Black Beauty. We had The Wizard of Oz, Raggedy Ann, Robinhood. and all those. We had encyclopedias to look at, and stuff like that. So I think they did their best. We don't have a computer, so we don't know anything about that stuff. It confuses me, and it worries me to see what you can do with these computers. I wonder how you can absorb all that stuff...you don't have time to sit down and read a book, think for yourself, or have an imagination.    Ms. Newman: What has struck me is that you essentially grew up in this small town and had so much imagination and such a sense of adventure. You traveled, read a lot, and you were connected with the world.    Ms. Schwartz: Yes. Nowadays, I understand the reason why some people are two generations behind us: some of these people want to have all these quiz programs. There is a very popular one that will probably go by the wayside in another six months or so. But they are simple questions that you feel people should know, but they don't know because they've been looking at a computer instead of reading a book. Our cousin Elizabeth used to come here for some reason or other, and she used to read to us while we were doing sewing. She used to read to us out of a fairy book, Grimm's Fairy Tales. We were brought up on all those "bad" things. I've never read Dr. Seuss, so I guess I'm illiterate. Not having any children of my own, I didn't have any reason to read those books.    Ms. Newman: But you remember all the classics.    Ms. Schwartz: Yes. Those books are now classics for that age in which they represent. The only comic I look at is Charlie Brown or Haggar, and on Sundays I look at Prince Valiant, which I always look forward to. We used to get children's magazines like Child Life or something like that. We were brought up on Collier's and...    Ms. Newman: The Saturday Evening Post?    Ms. Schwartz: Not necessarily The Saturday Evening Post, but Minerva used to get Collier's and used to look at it all the time. And we got the National Geographic. It took us forever to get rid of all those we had. But these are the things that we were brought up on. There again, I think it was that Victorian business...nothing was supposed to come into the house that was off-color. Boy, if you brought a True Confession magazine in, you went out the door as fast as the magazine! Nowadays, there is no such thing as True Confession. You just see it all on the television.    Ms. Newman: It sounds like a very happy place to have grown up.    Ms. Schwartz: Yes, we have no complaints. My mother had a heart problem, and she died very suddenly. My father had...    Ms. Newman: How old were you...were you grown?    Ms. Schwartz: Yes, I was in my thirties. She died when she was seventy-six or something like that, about a year after the War ended I think. After she died, Papa kind of went downhill a little bit. Let's see, mother died in 1946, and Papa died in 1950. He went downhill, but he had cancer of the lung. He didn't have any operation or anything like that.    Ms. Newman: Are they buried locally?    Ms. Schwartz: Yes. These are the first ones that were not buried in Philadelphia. They are out at Monmouth Memorial on Highway 33, and there are spaces there for us, too. My sister Edna, my sister Minerva, and her husband George are all buried out there. Clara and her husband were cremated, and they are up in Pennsylvania because that's where his children were.    Ms. Newman: This has been extremely interesting. I thank you very, very much.    Ms. Schwartz: Well, do you want to see the rest of the house?    Ms. Newman: Yes.      
MonmouthCounty;Mary and Robert Owen;1921;2000;Mary and Robert Owen, 1921, 2000        Remembering The 20th Century: An Oral History of Monmouth County    Date of Interview: June 19, 2000  Name of Interviewer: June West  Premises of Interview: Owen home, West Long Branch, NJ  Birthdates of Subjects: Mr. Owen, February 26, 1921     Mrs. Owen, June 8, 1920      Mary Owen  Mrs. Owen: It is wonderful to have you here, June, and I am happy to give some thoughts on growing up in Monmouth County and returning to Monmouth County after my husband's career in the Foreign Service, and what it has meant to me. We are in the home of my grandparents, Edwin O. Woolley and Mary Alice Woolley. They lived here since 1903 until their deaths. They had three children, but they sadly had two who died. But the three living children were James H. Woolley, Owen Woolley, and my mother, Mary Alma Woolley. My mother married comparatively late in life, and she married Edward Hance of Freehold. I used to visit this place when I was a little girl with my family, of course. I would come and spend a week or so in the summer with Grandmother and Grandfather, and Uncle Owen. When I grew older I also went to Long Branch to visit Uncle Jamie, as he was called, and Aunt Addie, his wife. They had no children, and I don't know if it was easy for them to have a little girl to visit or not. But they would have me for a week, and so did cousins who lived just down the street. To tell you the truth, visiting those cousins was the best visit. They were so loving of children, and they had a nice little dog, Captain, whom I enjoyed. We didn't have any pets at home in Freehold, so that was really a treat to have a dog to enjoy.    Ms. West: You were born in Freehold?    Mrs. Owen: I was born at what was then the hospital in Long Branch. I forget what it was called. But it is now the Monmouth Medical Center, of course. But I grew up in Freehold on Court Street, opposite Monument Park. That was a nice place to grow up. There was the park across the street to observe. However, my dear best friend, with whom I grew up, and I would love to go over to that park to play. But there was an overseer of the park who lived sort of in the rear of the area. He would come with his collie dog and chase us. (Laughter) And he would scare us, oh dear. So that was a little unfortunate happening. I watched the excavation for the Monmouth County Historical Association building. It was erected in the field next to us. The field used to have cattle grazing there, but it was certainly put to good use by having this fine Historical Association building.    Ms. West: What year was that erected?    Mrs. Owen: I believe that was in the 1930s, June. I am not sure, but maybe around 1935. I had chicken pox and was in bed, so I was able to watch. My father had two sons living, who were my half-brothers. One was Clifford Hance, and the other was Henry Hance. Both of them had farms. My father had been a farmer, having a farm that still exists on Burlington Road in Freehold Township. It is now used for horse training. It is a wonderful farm. So we visited that, and I called those two half-brothers uncles, because they were so much older than I was. Uncle Henry took over the running of that particular farm when father left it. So that farm was a part of my life. Uncle Clifford had a farm where he boarded horses and raised hay. So that farm was also, in a way, a part of my life. So it is no wonder that when we returned here to Monmouth County, I became interested in the environment. I began to work with recycling, and everything else possible to save the land. I am trying to save land.    Ms. West: You mentioned about when you returned here. This was after your husband retired from the Foreign Service?    Mrs. Owen: Yes. We debated as to whether we should retire in the Washington area. But Uncle Owen had left me this property, which was rented between the time of his death and my husband's retirement. And we debated and decided that Monmouth County was the place we wanted to come back to. And I am so thankful that we did that.    Ms. West: Did you have your schooling here in Monmouth County?    Mrs. Owen: Yes, the Freehold schools and Freehold High School.    Ms. West: Now your husband was telling me about this one-room school. Did you go to that same one-room school?    Mrs. Owen: No. He went to another one that was close to his house when he was a little boy. But I went to the Broad Street School in Freehold for one year. Then for whatever reason, we were transferred to the Hudson Street School. So that is where I went.    Ms. West: Was that the grade school or high school?    Mrs. Owen: That was grade school. Then I went up the street just a little bit for seventh and eighth grades, to the Intermediate School. After that, I went to Freehold High School.    Ms. West: And then you went on to college.    Mrs. Owen: And then I went on to college.    Ms. West: And what college did you attend?    Mrs. Owen: New Jersey College for Women, as it was known then. It is now Douglass College. I majored in journalism. I wanted to be a dancer when I was a little girl. But I took dancing lessons, and I found that I was not happy performing on a stage. So that worked me away from that. Mother really didn't want me to get married. She wanted me to have some kind of career abroad. She thought that would be wonderful. So I took French lessons with a couple of friends, even before I went to high school. But that wasn't for me. And so I was led to take journalism. While I never had a job in journalism, I think all the writing I have done for different reasons since meant that I was supposed to do that.    Ms. West: Are there any persons in Monmouth County that have had any significance in your life?    Mrs. Owen: Well, there is Betty Yard. She was Editor of the Monmouth Democrat Newspaper in Freehold. It was a weekly, and she was kind enough to take me in one summer to help her. I don't know if I really helped or hindered her, but she certainly gave me some support.    Ms. West: Did you do much traveling around in the county?    Mrs. Owen: Not so much. Of course in those days, traveling wasn't as easy as it is now. The cars didn't have heat or air conditioning, and they weren't as speedy, of course. But we went visiting. We had relatives in West Freehold. That was another farm in my life: the husband of a great-aunt of mine lived there. It was called the Solomon farm. And there are things in this house, like this chair for instance, that came from that farm. And we drove down to the shore. We loved Asbury Park. In those days, it was just wonderful for shopping, going to the beach, and for amusements. We did take a bus to Trenton, and that was wonderful, too.    Ms. West: How do you see Monmouth County today as opposed to the days when you were a youngster?    Mrs. Owen: Of course it has changed. It was an agricultural county. After my father retired from his own farm, he worked for the Brakely Canning Factory that was in Freehold. He went around to different farms supervising their production of produce for that canning factory. And so, you can see how I would ride along with him sometimes to see these farms.    Ms. West: What do you feel today…knowing what it was and how things were like then, and seeing how things are today?    Mrs. Owen: I am sorry to say sometimes it is heartbreaking to see the changes. Of course there is much to be praised, but also there is much that has been lost.    Ms. West: Is there any part of the county, historically, that might mean a little something more to you?    Mrs. Owen: These houses. As I say, there is that farm house on Burlington Road. In Elberon, there is my great-grandfather Mount's house on 4 Helen Court. That is a wonderful old house and has blessedly been restored. It is being lived in by a wonderful family now. On the corner of Route 35 and Deal Road is the Eden Woolley house. He was the brother of my great-great-grandfather, I think. He was one of the first councilmen in Ocean Township. So there are these houses that are parts of farms.    Ms. West: That is part of your life as well as a part of history that you are learning about. It is part of your life that you have experienced. You did mention this chair. Do you have other souvenirs or things around relating to the county?    Mrs. Owen: Well, this chair came from one of the farms. Upstairs is furniture. The bedroom above us has furniture that came from that house on Court Street, the bedroom suite. In the back bedroom is my great-grandmother Woolley's chest of drawers. And there is a little side table that I guess my great-great-grandmother White made. How she ever made a table, as a woman, I don't know. But it is a fine little side table by the bed.    Ms. West: I guess it gives you a feeling of closeness when you see all of this. You were showing me the peony out in the yard this morning. That was a root from your great-grandmother's peony. So how old would that root be? Almost 200 years old?    Mrs. Owen: I guess it would be 150 or 175 years old.    Ms. West: Just think that someone can keep that going for generations more.    Mrs. Owen: Yes, that would be wonderful.    Ms. West: So I can just imagine how you feel here in your home. It is the year 2000 now, and you go into houses now and see all the contemporary furnishings that you tire of and want to change. But you really feel like you are walking into a home here. I am sure that is how you must feel, that you are in a home, and not a showroom. I just know all the pleasure I have derived just being here all day, and I feel like I am home. It is just so comfortable, the atmosphere and the ambiance here in the house. It is just wonderful. Now tell me, as a little girl growing up before we had television, did you listen to the radio much?    Mrs. Owen: Yes.    Ms. West: Were there any favorite radio programs that you liked to listen to?    Mrs. Owen: Amos and Andy, The Shadow Knows, and right offhand I can't remember any others. And we used to listen to the news, of course.    Ms. West: And which commentators do you remember?    Mrs. Owen: I can't remember their names.    Ms. West: Looking at the way the children dress today, what were the fads in your day growing up? How did the youngsters dress?    Mrs. Owen: Well, we didn't have many clothes. You had best Sunday shoes and then your daily shoes. We had to wear stockings with some kind of funny garters, which I hated. (laughter) But that is what we had. We had simple little dresses, and mother made a lot of my clothes.    Ms. West: What type of music did you like?    Mrs. Owen: We had a Victrola in the front parlor. We used to listen to all kinds of nice old-fashioned records.    Ms. West: For the youngsters or others listening to this, tell them what a Victrola was.    Mrs. Owen: A Victrola was a piece of furniture that stood up maybe three or four feet tall. There was a storage space on the bottom for your records, and then the record player was on top, covered. So you lifted the cover, and then you were ready to play music. You had to wind it to keep it going. There was a player piano in that room, too. Even though I took piano lessons, I wasn't a success at those. So I was happy with a player piano.    Ms. West: Now the youngsters today might wonder what a player piano is.    Mrs. Owen: You had a roll of paper, into which was cut holes that somehow let air through. You sat on a bench in front of this piano, and you pumped so that the roll would turn and produce music.    Ms. West: As we call them, The Good Old Days, right?    Mrs. Owen: That's right. (Laughter)    Ms. West: You mention your family all being here. But where did they originate, your ancestors? What part of the world did they come from?    Mrs. Owen: England.    Ms. West: Who is the first President that you remember?    Mrs. Owen: I remember Calvin Coolidge.    Ms. West: Do you remember the first movie that you saw?    Mrs. Owen: The one with Mary Pickford going across the river, where there were crocodiles. I don't remember the name of it, but obviously I never will forget Mary Pickford.    Ms. West: Was that a talkie or a silent movie?    Mrs. Owen: A silent movie. My dear friend Betty and I loved to go to the movies. The Strand Theatre in Freehold would have Saturday afternoon movies, so she and I would enjoy those.    Ms. West: Did you like to read?    Mrs. Owen: Oh, I loved to read.    Ms. West: Did you have a favorite author?    Mrs. Owen: Robert Louis Stevenson, and whoever wrote the twin series. That was wonderful. There were Eskimo twins and Mexican twins, etc.    Ms. West: Did you have any heroes or heroines, or people that you looked up to?    Mrs. Owen: Charles Lindbergh. I was seven years old when Charles Lindbergh flew across the Atlantic, and that certainly was an exciting, wonderful accomplishment that we listened about on the radio.    Ms. West: Do you remember what year that was?    Mrs. Owen: 1927.    Ms. West: What made that so special though?    Mrs. Owen: It was the first solo flight across the Atlantic.    Ms. West: And where did the plane take off, do you recall?    Mrs. Owen: From the New York area.    Ms. West: And it flew from New York to where?    Mrs. Owen: Paris.    Ms. West: So back then, it was quite a feat.    Mrs. Owen: Yes, indeed!    Ms. West: What type of music did you like to listen to?    Mrs. Owen: I liked all kinds of music. Betty and I used to do jigs in the kitchen. When I took those dancing lessons, I learned to tap dance. And Uncle Owen was trying to teach me to tap dance. Every Sunday when we came down to visit for dinner, he would have me in the kitchen tap dancing. And I wasn't too good at it. He was better than I was.    Ms. West: Did you ever listen to the Big Bands, as they were called?    Mrs. Owen: Oh, I loved them.    Ms. West: Did you have a favorite band or orchestra that you liked to listen to?    Mrs. Owen: Tommy Dorsey and Glenn Miller. Bob and I came down to Asbury Park to dance at the Casino.    Ms. West: Oh, it was down at the shore.    Mrs. Owen: Yes.    Ms. West: So you loved to dance.    Mrs. Owen: Yes, we both loved to dance.    Ms. West: With the advent of television, were there any favorite television shows that you liked to watch, especially when it first came out?    Mrs. Owen: Yes, there were good ones.    Ms. West: Do you remember the atmosphere at the time when people got televisions that came into their home?    Mrs. Owen: Yes, it was exciting. There was Ozzie and Harriet, Lucille Ball and Desi Arnez, and they were fun programs.    Ms. West: Did you have any hobbies?    Mrs. Owen: Not especially. I can't think of any that were so consuming. Betty and I used to walk down to Lake Topanemus. That was something. It was so different from nowadays. We were so carefree and without worry. We were without concern or fear. She and I, at eight or ten years old, would walk from Monument Park down to Lake Topanemus, which was maybe a mile or so north of Freehold. We would just walk around there and look at the fish, if we were fortunate enough to see any fish. There was a place to rent rowboats, and sometimes we would rent one and be down there all day. Mothers didn't have to worry about us, we were fine. And when I was at college, I worked on the school newspaper at night, trying to get it ready for publication. I walked home by myself at midnight back to the dormitory, with no fear.    Ms. West: And today?    Mrs. Owen: You wouldn't do it.    Ms. West: That's sad.    Mrs. Owen: I know.    Ms. West: Is there any outstanding event or newspaper headline that stands out in your mind during the course of your life?    Mrs. Owen: I suppose World War II, the Declaration of War. I can remember sitting in this very room. Uncle Jamie had just died. His funeral was December 6th, it seems to me, and his birthday was December 6th. He must have died just about that time. We all were together after that sad time in this room, where the big radio was over here in the corner. And then the news of Pearl Harbor came.    Ms. West: That was pretty devastating.    Mrs. Owen: Yes, I should say so. So Bob, who of course had majored in ceramics and went on to MIT for Graduate work in that, had to stop and go serve in the Navy.    Ms. West: Can you explain to them what ceramics is?    Mrs. Owen: Ceramics also has industrial uses. It is bricks and clay work for building, and all that kind of thing.    Ms. West: The average person listening to this might think of pottery, so thank you for the clearer understanding of what it is. How long have you and Mr. Owen been married?      Mary and Robert Owen, 1995  Mrs. Owen: It will be fifty-eight years this August.    Ms. West: Isn't that wonderful! And you have how many children?    Mrs. Owen: We have four children.    Ms. West: Are they living in New Jersey?    Mrs. Owen: No.    Ms. West: Are they a distance away?    Mrs. Owen: The oldest is in Maine, and my next oldest is the daughter who lives in Michigan. My son is next, and he is in Florida. And my youngest is in North Carolina. So they are spread out.    Ms. West: I guess with the advent of transportation, the world has become smaller or more accessible, and we get further and further away from home.    Mrs. Owen: That's right, but they come to visit.    Ms. West: That's so nice, and I'm sure you look forward to that. How many grandchildren do you have?    Mrs. Owen: Seven. And that's nice. The three youngest boys who are in North Carolina love to come here. They really enjoy it.    Ms. West: Do they live in the city?    Mrs. Owen: They have a little farm there.    Ms. West: So they have a touch of the country.    Mrs. Owen: That's right. They help their father with the animals, and they have a good farm life.    Ms. West: What would you say is your greatest achievement in life?      The Owen Farm, 1999  Mrs. Owen: Well, I am thinking it would be the saving of these fields, which we have done. That is my greatest achievement as far as something for the future is concerned. The seven and a half acres has a conservation easement, and the town will probably take them over perhaps by next year. So they will never be built on.    Ms. West: Isn't that wonderful?    Mrs. Owen: Yes, that's really wonderful. But then I'm so thankful, of course, to have these four fine children and seven grandchildren.    Ms. West: Awhile ago you were talking about your recycling work, and I got the impression that you are more or less the "mother" of recycling here in Monmouth County. Could you tell us a little something about that and how you became involved?    Mrs. Owen: We lived in Russia, in the Soviet Union for a time. They had little, special collection points or shops for bringing back your milk bottles and jars for preserving fruits and vegetables. People were paid for them, and that was a wonderful system. In other European countries, you returned your beverage bottles.    Ms. West: Could you give me a year for that?    Mrs. Owen: We were in Moscow twice, 1951 and 1952, and then again in 1958-1961. It must have been the second time we were there, and we were so conscious of that. When we came here to West Long Branch, I listened to the Asbury Park radio station. I heard Henry Seales, who was in Long Branch, and he was forming a recycling operation there. So I thought that if Long Branch can do it, why can't we? I took my things to Long Branch and observed how they handled it all. And so in 1973 I went to my first Council meeting here in West Long Branch and asked why they couldn't start doing it. Well, the councilman responsible for the Environmental Commission was interested. He, I, and another friend talked about it all, and we thought that the best way to begin was to have the Scouts make money from it. And so not only the Boy Scouts, but the Girl Scouts as well got involved. They helped with the collection of newspaper from the people, and they put the papers in the recycling company's truck, and they got the money for it. And that was a good income for them, and it worked out well. And it was good training for them, also. So that went well, and then we decided we should get into glass. So we did glass next. And the processing company took the glass as well as the papers. So then we branched into aluminum and tin, and so we got a program going. Finally we thought it was going so well, the town could take it over. So they took it over then. A friend in Oceanport, whom I got to know by telephone, wanted to get a regional program started, to get more towns into it. So she and I worked and went to meetings and did what we could, and we did get five towns really involved. And it has really spread.    Ms. West: And now in a lot of other states, everybody is recycling.    Mrs. Owen: That's right.    Ms. West: That must give you a great sense of accomplishment as far as the environment is concerned, right? And you are still involved in this program?    Mrs. Owen: I try.    Ms. West: So what would you say is your greatest achievement in life, besides recycling?    Mrs. Owen: Well, the saving of the fields.    Ms. West: The way things have transpired over your life, when you look back to your youth and look how things are today, how different has your life been than what you thought it might be as a youngster?    Mrs. Owen: I certainly never expected to travel and live abroad. And yet that was what my dear mother hoped for, and by marrying a man she didn't exactly approve of, that happened for me. And she didn't want me to be a slave to housework. Because we were abroad and our life circumstances were such as they were, I had help with the housework. So it is really interesting how things worked out. I would not have expected all this, yet it must have been meant to be. When I was little and visiting here, there was a coal range in the kitchen, and it was hot in the summer. There were laundry tubs out on the west side, where now there is a little room where the freezer and little bathroom are. Those were valuable means of doing the laundry. We sat out on the front porch to keep cool. In the summer, there were five or six rocking chairs or wicker chairs out there. Now you couldn't sit out there. The air is bad quality, and it is so noisy with all the traffic that you can't hear each other speak. So you don't see any chairs out there.    Ms. West: And you have a beautiful, wraparound porch.    Mrs. Owen: But also in all the other places that I have been mentioning, they are not in use any more.    Ms. West: So your lifestyle has had to change drastically.    Mrs. Owen: Absolutely.    Ms. West: It would be nice to sit out there on the porch.    Mrs. Owen: And have a cool breeze blowing.    Ms. West: Nothing remains the same.    Mrs. Owen: That's right. When I was a little girl and grandfather was still alive, I never will forget the time he was going to take the horse to be shod. There was a horse out there in the barn, but the barn has since burned, unfortunately. There was a cowshed behind the barn, and there was a nice cow that produced wonderful milk. Well, he was taking the horse and invited me to ride along. So on this country road, just a gravel road, we went across the area where Pathmark is now and the new mall is across the street. We could just cut across that, it was like a wooded area, but we could cut through there to get to Eatontown, where the blacksmith was. Imagine! That must have been around 1926 or 1928. You would never think of having a horse and wagon on a road these days.    Ms. West: Gosh, no.     Mrs. Owen: Another memory was Freehold on a Saturday night. After my father died in 1935, Mother and I would feel free on Saturday nights to walk downtown and see the people. The stores were open, and it was such fun. People came in from other towns to shop or just walk around and see things.    Ms. West: It was more like a village then, right?    Mrs. Owen: That's right.    Ms. West: When you look at the world today, how does that make you feel?    Mrs. Owen: I am having a hard time with this year 2000, I'm sorry to say. Maybe I had big anticipation that things were going to be better for people and the world. But to me, people are suffering and the world is suffering.    Ms. West: When your children or grandchildren come around and you sit down to tell them the stories about how things were, do they  listen politely?    Mrs. Owen: Now and then we will talk about it, and I think they appreciate hearing about it.    Ms. West: So what would you say would be your legacy to your children and grandchildren?    Mrs. Owen: It's hard to say, but I think, memories. We have shared a lot together, living overseas together. Perhaps that's more real to them than this house is. Jeff, the youngest, was about twelve years old when we came here. So he is the only one who went to the West Long Branch schools and to our church. So the town means a little bit more to him, and yet he was not happy. He kind of didn't fit in, so he doesn't have the best memories of it. We offered him to come here and take over the place, but he didn't want to. While I can sit and convey to you these things, it is not easy for me to talk to them about it. Or maybe I just don't take the time.    Ms. West: Is there anything that you would like to accomplish that you haven't yet?    Mrs. Owen: I would like to see this house preserved. There is no provision for protecting this house, along with the land. And you know yourself, to restore an old house with all the lead paint, old electrical wiring, and asbestos in the cellar, takes a lot of money. And yet, it has a lot of history here. As you say, the furniture alone is valuable.      Mary and Robert Owen outside of their farm house  Ms. West: How old is this house?    Mrs. Owen: Well, as Bob said, he thinks it was built around 1870 or 1880.    Ms. West: What about historical significance? What about the Historical Society?    Mrs. Owen: No way. I have talked to them all. I talked to the Monmouth County Historical Association first of all. Then I talked to the Monmouth Conservation Foundation, and it has its hands full trying to preserve land. They can't manage buildings. The Monmouth County Genealogical Club doesn't have any money for things.    Ms. West: Saving land is most important. But as I sit around and look at all this, once it is gone, it is gone forever.    Mrs. Owen: That's right.    Ms. West: The craftsmanship is unbelievable. People can go to Home Depot and get plastic that resembles wood, but this is the real thing.    Mrs. Owen: People really admire this woodwork.    Ms. West: You can't help it. I didn't notice it the first time I was here this morning, but also look at the doorknob and the keyhole, the cover over the keyhole.    Mrs. Owen: It's porcelain.    Ms. West: And besides that, kids today peep through the keyhole, even with my children. And there is a cover over the keyhole. I looked at that and thought how wonderful. If somebody were building a home today, I could tell them to take the doors, and take this and that. This is your interview, so I can't say what I am thinking. When I get off the tape, though, I'll say a few things. (Llaughter) This house is just unbelievable, and when it is gone, it's gone forever.    Mrs. Owen: Under that afghan is my great-grandfather's sea chest.    Ms. West: Really?    Mrs. Owen: In it is his sextant and his diary. I haven't lifted the lid of it in years and years, and I pray that it is all right.    Ms. West: Your children will come get all of that, right?    Mrs. Owen: I don't know! I may give it to the Historical Association.    Ms. West: Oh, to preserve it, by all means. I bet a lot of people don't even know what a sextant is.    Mrs. Owen: I know it, isn't that the truth.    Ms. West: And to be able to see something like that and know what it was used for, wow. And the history here in this house is so great. I am looking at all the handwork that was done, and the wallpaper  don't ever take that down.    Mrs. Owen: Weren't we fortunate to find this wallpaper? When we came, there was a little store over in the mall. And that's where we got all the wallpaper. And for this room, isn't it perfect?    Ms. West: Ideal! If walls could only talk, it would be nice. But your home is really a home. It's not walking into some showroom. What advice would you give young people today if somebody were to ask for some advice?    Mrs. Owen: I would tell them to try to keep life as simple as possible. Try to have faith and keep that faith close to you, day in and day out. Try to be involved with your government, and really try to be with your children if you have any. You only have your children for so long, and they need you.    Ms. West: A lot of today's children act like they don't need you, but they do. And maybe more so than when you and I were coming up.    Mrs. Owen: That's right.    Ms. West: Is there anything else you would like to tell me?    Mrs. Owen: Well, I have been so fortunate to have friends from Freehold. Dear Betty moved to Florida, and then to Virginia. Of course we don't see each other any more, but we write and phone. A friend in Freehold who lives in a wonderful house on East Main Street, and I talk on the phone, too. And there is another friend with whom I used to walk to school. She and I keep in touch. So those friendships mean a lot.    Ms. West: I'm sure they do. You and your husband have been married for fifty-eight years, and you have a lot of memories and things to share. If you could describe your life as a roadmap, how would you depict it?    Mrs. Owen: There have been ups and downs, of course. That's to be expected. But by the grace of God, we have gotten through the difficult times and are very thankful to have reached the point of living here. And truly I am living life as I believe I would have hoped to have lived. The other part was wonderful, all that traveling and meeting wonderful people in other countries and seeing beautiful places. But I guess home is where the heart is.    Ms. West: That's what they say, there's no place like home. Would you have wanted to change any phase of your life or would you leave it as it was?    Mrs. Owen: I would keep it the way it is.    Ms. West: The contentment.    Mrs. Owen: I am very thankful.    Ms. West: What are your deepest values?    Mrs. Owen: Faith in the good Lord, the family, and God's creations should be protected.    Ms. West: I gather this new millennium has you depressed. How would you like to see things in this millennium if you could make a change?    Mrs. Owen: I would like people really to understand the threat we humans are to the balance of life. We should be protecting the air. I shouldn't wake up at 6:00 a.m. in the spring and think why do I have this taste in my mouth, this awful chemical taste? The leaders who give their word to keep peace in countries, they should stick to their word. They should look after their people and not have them abused and killed for these political reasons. By the year 2000, we should have outgrown all that. And people should participate in government more. With the number of voters decreasing, it just isn't right. We are a country that is 225 years old, and so many lives have been given for our freedom. We should be taking responsibility to at least get out and vote. End of preaching! (laughter) There are many wonderful things, and I appreciate your participation in this wonderful program for the Arts. We used to go to New Jersey Symphony Orchestra concerts in Red Bank, and enjoyed them so. We still do go to Monmouth Symphony Orchestra concerts, and we are very appreciative of that fine music. We used to go pretty faithfully to Monmouth Museum, but we don't get that far anymore. We are just slowing down. But that is another advantage of living in Monmouth County. We can go to Asbury Park, Red Bank for concerts, and see museum exhibits so easily.    Ms. West: There is an awful lot offered here.    Mrs. Owen: Yes, a great deal.    Ms. West: And there are so many things that don't even cost any money. I imagine a lot of us don't avail ourselves of what is out there for us. I must admit, it's a beautiful county. And it's full of history.    Mrs. Owen: Yes, it is.    Ms. West: We are kind of running out of tape, so let me thank you for allowing me to speak with you. I speak for the Library, of course, and not just myself. It was just wonderful meeting you and your husband. This has truly been my pleasure, you just don't know.    Mrs. Owen: Thank you very much.      Mr. Robert Owen  The subject of the next part of this interview  is Robert Irvins Owen. Mr. Owen was with the American Foreign Service with the State Department. His last foreign assignment was as an American Consul General in Zdegreb, Yugoslavia.     Mr. Owen: My father and mother were in New Brunswick when I was born. My father was working at the Rutgers College Agricultural Experiment Station, and also in that period was the first Middlesex County Agricultural Agent. At one point he had been a poultry specialist. Since my mother thought he wasn't making enough money working for Rutgers, she wanted him to move. So he bought a used poultry farm in Bradevelt, Monmouth County on Newman Springs Road, across from the Dutch Reformed Church. We went there when I was about three or three and a half years old.    Ms. West: What town was that?    Mr. Owen: It was the Township of Marlboro in what is called the Bradevelt area. It was at one time a railroad stop on the way from Freehold to Matawan. It was an old poultry farm, and it was overrun with rats. It was quite an interesting experience as we got it ready again for poultry. It was right next to a schoolhouse, which at that point was a one-room school with no running water with six grades in one room. By the time I was four and a half, my mother, who was so eager to get me off to Rutgers College, sent me over next door to school. Happily, I was only there in first grade for four or five months before the school was closed. The kids there were moved to Marlboro Grammar School in Marlboro Village, down the road toward Freehold about a mile. So that was very interesting.    Ms. West: How many grades were in the schoolhouse?    Mr. Owen: There were six grades in the little one I started out in. There were a lot of tough kids there, I tell you, from an area called Big Woods up the road. It was mostly children of immigrants from the Baltic States. But I still remember some of the experiences very vividly, and not always happily. Anyway, when we went to Marlboro, a school bus would come by and take me to school.    Ms. West: To get back to the one-room schoolhouse, did one teacher teach all six grades?    Mr. Owen: Yes. And there were two separate doors. One was on the east side for the boys to go in, and there was one on the west side for the girls to go in. On each side was like a little anteroom, with places to hang your coats in the wintertime. They had a five or six gallon bottle of water and paper drinking cups. In back were the outhouses, one for the boys and one for the girls. It was really good in the sense that both sexes were represented in the classes. But it worked out really quite well. Right next to the schoolhouse to the west, ran the railroad that went from Freehold to Matawan. That railroad ran partly alongside our property -- further back where we had our poultry houses and personal garden. We had six acres there. I might make the observation that when I came to Marlboro, it was a transition time in America, as well as in Monmouth County.    Ms. West: What year was that?    Mr. Owen: This was about 1924 or 1925. I don't remember too many details of that time, being that young. But I do remember there was still a long shed in the cemetery across the street. It was in an open area that is now filled in with graves. This shed was a sheltered parking place for horses and buggies. At that time, there was still at least one farmer who came with his family in a horse and buggy, and they would tie up the horse in that shed. It was a transition time on the farms because tractors were just being introduced to the farms. The farmers did not want to give up their horses, so most of them had both. They had a new tractor and at least one team of horses in their barns. I worked for one of those farmers in the summertime about eight or nine years later, and he still had a pair of horses there that he used for some things. At that time, that whole area was agricultural. There wasn't hardly anyone living within a quarter of a mile or so from where we lived. There was a house that later became the head doctor's house, after remodeling. And that was the closest one to us. There was an Italian family there, and I knew the boy. He was a little bit older than I, and they didn't stay long enough for us to become very good friends. I had my first easy-over eggs there with him, and they ate any time of the day or night. If you got hungry, you went out to the kitchen and cooked some eggs or something. Our other neighbors were up on what we called Barkers Hill, but there were no children my age. The family there was named Barker, and they had a turkey farm. The hill is a peculiar geological formation there. I don't recall the name now, but that is where Camp Arrowhead of the YMCA is now. I used to go sledding there with friends. It was quite interesting, and we found fossils. There was a tributary of Big Brook at the end of our place in back, and it has had a lot of publicity lately because of fossils found there. We found this particular type of fossil that we called a "lightning bolt," and it actually was from an ancient squid or some other marine animal. But that whole area was agricultural with mainly one big crop, which was potatoes. But they also had truck farming, which meant a variety of vegetables that the farmers would take by truck into a city to sell in the markets. And they mostly took them to Newark or New York. Roads, like the one in front of our place, were macadam. And the road between Matawan and Freehold, Route 79, was paved, too. It was one of the early concrete roads, and there was no New Jersey Turnpike or Garden State Parkway at that time. But the other roads to the farms in the west, which is now mostly people and houses, were not paved. This area included the farms of the families who sent boys to the school that I attended in Marlboro. Some of them still had working outhouses. And only recently had they had electricity installed. That's six or eight farms there…the Whitson Farm, the McDowell Farm, and the Hayes Farm, among others. There must be hundreds of people now living where those farms were, if not even thousands, if you went far enough. Once I was old enough to ride a bicycle or ride a horse (which I had for a while), I would visit with those families. I remember the Hayes family, and the mother would churn her own milk and make her own butter. And in the little outhouse they still had Sears catalogues used for toilet paper, or even a few corn cobs which were sometimes used in lieu of toilet paper. But it was a good life. It wasn't primitive, although it may sound so today. In our own case, when we came to our house, we had a gas stove and an icebox. The ice man would come by maybe once a week, and you would have a sign in your window to show how many pounds you wanted. Then he would cut if off and bring it into the house. Of course, there were other people of that nature. There was the rag man, the man who would sharpen your scissors, and so on. I forget the name of the bakery, perhaps it was Dugan's Bakery, and his truck used to come by. It made more noise than most of the trucks on that road, and as a result, my dog was killed. He, Shep, never chased cars except that one bakery truck. I think he chased it because the man must have been mean to him at some point or other, or perhaps kicked at him when he delivered bread. When that dog died,  we assumed it was probably that same bakery truck that hit him. Otherwise, Shep was very careful crossing the road and didn't chase any other trucks. When the dog died, it really broke my heart. I suppose I was about eight years old, and we brought a stone from the cemetery to mark his grave in our yard. It was an unused stone that had been discarded. That cemetery was important to me. My family belonged to that church and I sang in the choir until my voice changed. But the cemetery was a playground for me where I would visit frequently. The first sexton was a lovely, old Irish gentleman, Henry Hardy. He wasn't old by my standards today, but he was old by my standards then: he had, at one point, worked briefly for my father, as long as my father could afford it. He also babysat me on occasion. But he was happy to have me come around the cemetery. If there had been a funeral and he was filling in the grave, which I believe he himself had probably dug, he would pay me ten cents to help him fill in the grave. And I did that.    Ms. West: What was the name of that church?    Mr. Owen: That was called The Old Brick Church, but it was really the Dutch Reformed Church of Marlboro. And it was the main Protestant church for Marlboro Village, but the people had to come a mile to get to it. It had no central heating or running water, and there was an outhouse out in back somewhere. That probably was used mostly by the sexton when he was there. Since there was no heating, it was only used during warm weather. In the wintertime, there was a chapel on Main Street in Marlboro Village that served as a church. Services and church suppers were held there, rather than the one that was across from our house. Our house is still there across from the church, but of course it is under different ownership now. And what used to be a poultry farm is now something else. I forget the name of it now. The new owners have a roadside stand for selling vegetables, flowers, etc.    Ms. West: How old would that house be today, do you have any idea?    Mr. Owen: It was not a very old house, but it's hard for me to remember in terms of my different attitude about time now than I had then. But I think it probably was built sometime in the early twentieth century, and it certainly wasn't new when we came there. But it had none of the characteristics of an old house  it was what you might call a bungalow. We had six and a half acres, a small barn, and three very long poultry buildings. Only a part of one remains today. One of them had a huge cellar, which is where my father had an incubator for baby chicks. It didn't work out too well. His whole poultry farm suffered when the bottom dropped out of the market for eggs and poultry during the Depression. But to keep in this pre-Depression period, it was also the Prohibition period. I recall that during the Depression, there were a lot of what you would call hobos or unemployed people roaming around and looking for work of some kind. There also were tramps, somewhat less reputable people, that went around. A lot of them, obviously, were alcoholics. Going to Marlboro Village sometimes in the early mornings, you would find empty sterno cans and liquor bottles on the sidewalk in front of what was the old, small town hall. That hall was only used three or four times a year for meetings.    Ms. West: Can you explain the difference between a hobo and a bum to somebody who might be listening to this tape?    Mr. Owen: The ones I am just now speaking about were probably qualified to be considered bums. The words are somewhat interchangeable, but the word hobo referred primarily to the men who, during the Depression, were unemployed and traveled around hoping to find employment. They traveled through on trains by climbing on the freight cars, and so forth. And they might find seasonal work in some areas, like harvesting potatoes, etc. They were sort of migrant workers without steady employment. And they were often hungry men, who would stop and offer to do some work for a little food. I remember my mother always kept bologna in the icebox or refrigerator and extra bread, so that if someone came she would be able to give them a bologna sandwich and water at our pump.    Ms. West: Did they have their hobo camps around near the railroad?     Mr. Owen: Yes, they did. I remember one particular little camp. It was temporary, and they never stayed there more than a few nights. It was under a railroad trestle for that railroad between Bradevelt and Freehold. I remember sometimes walking along that railroad and being a little scared to cross the trestle, because you could see down through the ties some forty or fifty feet to the stream. And you could see where they had a campfire, and maybe they had stolen or been given a few potatoes or vegetables, and they would cook them there. We were never worried about them, really. They never bothered us, and they were almost invariably polite whenever they came to our place. Very often my mother would have them do some yard chore in return for something to eat, because she thought as a matter of principle it was better for them as well as for us. Sometimes they would only want a drink of water from our pump. We weren't bothered by them any more than we were bothered later on by the Marlboro State Hospital patients. The hospital property was right next to our house on the east side. The patients would be working outside, and sometimes they would come over for water. You would occasionally hear of ones that had taken "French leave" of the place and gotten over the fence and away. But there were never any instances in my childhood of any harm being done by any of them.    Ms. West: What type of a hospital was it?    Mr. Owen: It was a mental hospital. When it was being built, it was considered top of the line. It was one of the most modern and advanced hospitals in the state, if not the country.  I was over there watching the construction before the fences were up. One of the first things they did was drill a well to find water, and they also started a water treatment and sewage plant. I was over watching them drilling down through the different layers of soil and seeing what came up to the surface.    Ms. West: Do you know what year the hospital was built?    Mr. Owen: I forget now. It is still there physically, but they haven't decided fully what they are going to do with it. The Parks system has already bought some areas to the south of Newman Springs Road. And there are other various plans floating around, because there are a lot of good, substantial brick buildings there. As a matter of fact, I worked there. I knew people there, and my mother and father played cards with the doctors and their wives. But there were few children my age. The Stevenson family had a boy my age, Linford, and he had a younger brother and a sister. He had two younger brothers, Billy and Kenny. The father was in charge of the agricultural work. The hospital grew a lot food on the land, and the patients did much of the work under supervision. Mr. Stevenson was in charge of that aspect. By then, the Italian family's house had been fixed over for the head doctor, Dr. Gordon. The Hospital Superintendent was Robert Cox, and his son was my friend. The Superintendent was in charge over all the administration, and the head doctor was in charge of the medical operation. When it was being built, later on when I was a little older, there was the thought that I might get a job carrying water for the construction workers. At least my father and I thought it was a good idea, but it was vetoed by my mother. But I did work there during my college time at Rutgers. I was at Rutgers from the fall of 1937 until June of 1941. This must have been around 1938 that I worked at the hospital one summer. I worked for the head of stores, and I was his assistant. I helped him there, supervising four inmates who were able to help him regularly. On occasion, I also would have a gang of maybe eight or ten patients who would carry bulk foods from one building to the other underground in tunnels. It was a good experience, and a good way to spend the summer. I was paid the same rates as the "attendants" who monitored and helped the patients: fifty dollars a month plus room and board eligibility, which I didn't use.    Ms. West: Was there anybody in Monmouth County who had a profound influence upon your life?    Mr. Owen: A great many, actually. The first and earliest one that I can mention was Henry Hardy, who was the church sexton. He was perhaps the first Catholic I had known, and certainly the first tobacco-chewing Irishman I had known. He was a lovely man. If I had needed any teaching in tolerance, he would have helped me. But I don't think I was aware of any intolerance at that age. Another very important influence was a black man named Julius Stewart. He had come up from the South, and he was a very stocky, short man. He was very strong in his upper body, and he came and worked for a little while for my father. He fixed up and lived in one of the small poultry buildings. Later on, he also worked as sexton at the cemetery. But I remember him mostly because he was such a gentleman. I was maybe ten or eleven, and I went to work summers in the potato fields picking potatoes. And he and I would often go as a team. A machine would dig the potatoes up, and the farmer had dropped off these empty barrels every certain number of feet. We would have to fill three heaping bushel baskets in order to fill one of those barrels, and those bushels were sixty pounds each. That meant that the barrel would weigh 175-180 pounds. You and your teammate would lift that big barrel up on the back of a truck. It wasn't so bad if it was an old-fashioned truck like a cart drawn by horses, because that was fairly low to the ground. But if it was a real automotive truck, you had to lift it about another foot to get it up on that truck. And it took quite exquisite teamwork to do that. I guess I must have been twelve by then, to do that. But that was not easy work. When the price was good for potatoes, say like ten cents a barrel, you could make five dollars a day or more. And you'd work maybe five hours or so, until it got too hot. The potatoes would scald if they got too hot. If you weren't coordinated exactly and one of you didn't lift at the right time or pull the right way, the other one got most of that weight. So I am lucky I don't have a bad back today as a result of that. I worked on another farm, and old Jake Stattel was the farmer when I worked there. Later, his son, Dan Stattel, took over the farm, and is now deceased. Mrs. Stattel was very nice, and she got them to pay me to help her around the place sometimes when there weren't potatoes to pick. I would get two dollars a day for ten hours, which was not exactly rolling in wealth, but I earned it. It might be the equivalent eight or more dollars now, I suppose. And that's per day, not per hour. But it was interesting growing up, and I enjoyed it.    Ms. West: And you graduated from what high school?    Mr. Owen: Freehold High School, which was the only high school in that area. I guess there are three or four high schools now. It covered that whole area back then, and I suppose we had maybe 120 students in our graduating class. There were probably fewer than 500 in the entire high school then.    Ms. West: Then you went to Rutgers University?    Mr. Owen: I went to Rutgers, and I never thought of going to any other university. My father had followed his older brother into Rutgers College. The older brother was class of 1904, and my father had to stay home and work on the farm until his brother got through Rutgers. In fact my father left high school after two years to work on the farm. Then he went back and took two years in one year to graduate from high school in upper New York State. Then he got a special New York State Regents Scholarship to go to Rutgers, and worked his way through entirely. He was the oldest and strongest man in his class, but his class was not huge. There were something like eighty students in the 1908 graduating class at Rutgers.    Ms. West: What did you major in at Rutgers?    Mr. Owen: I had done very well in math and science in high school, and got the science mathematics medal, and so on. But I didn't know what I wanted to do. I graduated at age sixteen from high school. Since I had done well in those subjects and my family knew the head of the Ceramics Department at Rutgers, ceramics seemed to embody what I was good in. So I figured I would try it out. Like a lot of things in life, you try it out and see if you like it. So I stayed in Ceramics for four years at Rutgers, and it was considered one of the toughest majors. In our particular class in the School of Ceramics, there were only eight or ten of us.    Ms. West: It was an Ivy League school at that time, right?    Mr. Owen: No, it was never actually an Ivy League school, and it's still not today. In 1766 it was founded. It was not quite an Ivy League college, but close. In any case, I was active in various things and sports while I was there. I might say here that I owe a great deal to my mother. Since we came to Marlboro from New Brunswick and she was a city girl, she didn't want me to become a "hick," so to speak, from living in the country. This was somewhat to my disadvantage, because, for example, she wanted me to wear shorts when other boys my age in Marlboro were wearing knickers. So I came into a certain amount of criticism from my peers, off and on. She would take me into New Brunswick for the dentist and Trenton for special clothes. I wanted to just be one of the fellows. But she wouldn't quite let me, and she kept telling me that I really had to work, study, get good grades and follow my father to Rutgers, etc. So when I went to Freehold High School, I was one of the people from the country. I wasn't in the social groups that had gone to school together in Freehold earlier, and it took me a while to break in. But because of my mother's influence, even though I was not particularly good at sports like baseball, I went out for baseball and joined clubs. And later on I went out for football, to prove something. I never did very well, but I was on the team for a couple of years. And then I realized that I had a lot of stamina for a young man, so I started running at track. They didn't have cross country then, they only had track. I turned out to be the best miler, relatively speaking, around. And that was because I could run a mile, and a lot of them couldn't get anywhere near a mile. Hitchhiking back and forth home from school also helped. I ended up being the Vice President of the class and got my little gold "F" and so forth. And I dated all the pretty girls, including my present wife. And I had a great time in high school. You might say I was a little mature for my age. But if it hadn't been for my mother, I probably would have had a very minor level of activity in high school, like most of the people who came from Marlboro. But she got me going, and once I got going, I liked it and developed.    Ms. West: Well, your ancestors…where did they come from?    Mr. Owen: My father's side has no Monmouth County background. They go back to the seventeenth century. I have a book of the Owen family that revealed where our first ancestor in this country supposedly was buried. Many, many years later, I drove up there with several of our children. We did it on the way to visit somebody else. I guess it was my older son in Maine. We found the cemetery, and I offered the children a bonus dollar if they could find the grave of this first Owen ancestor, John Owen. And they found him in the cemetery. So that was interesting. I had a one-car accident in the cemetery, which was rather unusual.    Ms. West: A nice place to have an accident, right?    Mr. Owen: Well, I turned a corner too short and hit one of the car's fenders on a marked cornerstone. So I had to pay for that. The ancestors on my mother's side are many, many Monmouth County antecedents, because the name is Wright. There were a lot of Wrights around. You have heard, of course, of Wrightstown to the south. My great-great-grandfather was in Monmouth County and was quite an illustrious person, I gather. He bought this farm that is now called Merino Farm, which is out near Allentown in Monmouth County. It was quite a thing, this farm. His name was Samuel Gardener Wright. My grandfather, Joseph Brognard Wright, was his son, but he was the younger son. The older son kept the farm, and my grandfather left the farm. He moved around Monmouth County and worked at all sorts of jobs. At one point as a young man, he was working at Asbury Park. I think he was either delivering milk or newspapers, and he had a horse drawn delivery wagon of some sort. He kept moving all over the place. He sired a lot of children. He and my grandmother had twelve children, of whom only six survived. I guess one of those six survived long enough to reach his teens, but they moved around a lot. Most of his children were born back at or near the area of the old farm, according to our old family Bible. It may be at the same place, but with different names of the immediate locality where children were born there.  Then Grandfather would go off somewhere else again, often visiting other relatives. My mother was actually born out in Iowa. My father used to tease her that there was probably some scandal involving my grandfather so that he felt it was useful to be out of the state for a while. That tale may have some validity, but I am not sure. Grandfather later had been in politics, and he had run for Mayor of New Brunswick. He wasn't particularly successful. I didn't really know him until he was in his seventies, and he couldn't see very well. Through older cousins, I understand that he was wonderful with children. But he finally ended up living in Farmingdale, New Jersey. I still haven't been there to locate his grave because late in his life he married his second wife, Sadie. I don't think my mother and her sisters approved of the marriage. The family name was Goodenoff, and they were an old Farmingdale family. It sounds like a Dutch name, but I don't know if it is or not. Anyway, we went once in a while to visit him in Farmingdale. They lived in a little house that must have gone back to the Revolution. The house is still in Farmingdale, but it has been moved to another location. For a while he ran a little store there. According to my mother, he was cheated because of being nearly blind. Kids would come in to the store, give him a dollar bill and tell him it was a five, and he would give them change. So that kind of thing happened. I remember visiting him and his second wife, whom I was told to call Aunt Sadie, although she was my step-grandmother. They were sweet old people.    Ms. West: He traveled quite a bit around the County then?    Mr. Owen: As an adult, he traveled around New Jersey quite a bit. He ended up in real estate in New Brunswick. My mother spent a lot of her childhood being the person in the family whom everyone else could rely on to do most of the drudge work. She looked after her mother, who was sick much of her married life. You might say it was due to excessive childbirth (twelve births!). There was only one boy surviving to manhood in the group, Uncle Lester, and he became a freight train engineer. Uncle Lester used to come and visit us in Marlboro once in a while. I remember him as any child would because, as one of our few visitors, he always came with some little toy for me. This was usually a wind-up toy like the one you mentioned with Mickey Mouse swinging back and forth and little things that popped. After his first wife, my Aunt Anna, died, he would come alone. The family didn't approve of her too much, or at least my mother and her three sisters didn't. I don't remember her. They had a little Boston Terrier, Tiny, and after his wife's death, Uncle Lester turned him over to us, and we kept him at our place. He was a very nice but very stubborn little dog.    Ms. West: Besides your home where you grew up, is there any part of the County that has any particular significance to you?    Mr. Owen: Well, is Fort Dix in Monmouth County?    Ms. West: No.    Mr. Owen: Well, Sea Girt is in Monmouth County. There used to be the Governor's summer 'White House' in Sea Girt. There was also a military area there. In high school, one of my best friends, Frank Bartron, had an older brother who was in the Air Guards 119th or 118th Operation Squadron operating out of Newark. And they had summer training camps down at Sea Girt some years. Other times it was at Camp Dix. But one time when it was in Sea Girt - I remember when they had their two weeks camp, they would hire a couple of civilian boys to help out in their kitchen. They employed a cook from Newark and several of his people, but then they had a couple of boys to help out. In this case, Frank and I went and worked there. We helped them set up the tents on the grounds of the Sea Girt camp grounds, and then once it got started, we were peeling potatoes, helping clear dishes off of tables, or whatever needed to be done.    Ms. West: Do you have any heroes or heroines?    Mr. Owen: I suppose if you want to, you could say that Lindbergh was one of our heroes. I remember when he crossed the Atlantic, and we would hear about him on the radio. And we would see his pictures in the papers.    Ms. West: What do you mean when he crossed the Atlantic?    Mr. Owen: Well, he was the first pilot to cross the Atlantic in a single engine plane. It was about 1927 as I recall.    Ms. West: And he went from where to where?    Mr. Owen: He started from some airport in Long Island, I think, and ended up in Paris, or some place near there. I am just sort of recalling what I can. But he was a real All-American Hero. Later on, of course, we were glued to our radios when the reports came in about the kidnapping of his little baby. We were, of course, here in New Jersey then. And we listened to whatever they told us about the trial, and it was a big "to do." We were also here when the Graf Zeppelin went down in Lakehurst later on. Then there was the Morro Castle disaster off Asbury Park. The impending war was coming on, but in high school we just didn't think much about it when we heard about Mussolini and Hitler. We were so involved in our own teenage lives that these other things sort of washed over us.    Ms. West: Who was the first President that you remember?    Mr. Owen: I remember Presidents Calvin Coolidge and Herbert Hoover, but I didn't see either one of them. We heard about them, and of course Hoover had the misfortune to be President when the Depression came. He seemed, apparently, to be a little indecisive and didn't know what to do. But that was a pretty difficult situation. Then Roosevelt came in and did all sorts of interesting things and experiments, and some worked and some didn't. But at least he got us going again and had a more optimistic view. I suppose it's partly because of this that both my wife and I are Democrats although we both came from solid Republican families. Mary's uncle had been the Republican Mayor of West Long Branch.    Ms. West: Do you remember the New Deal?    Mr. Owen: Oh, I remember the New Deal all right. For one reason, I was a stamp collector. They came out with a whole series of different stamps. The regular three cent stamp had the big NRA on it, for the National Recovery Administration, etc. I certainly remember the Depression. That was maybe one reason I have had the deserved reputation of being a bit close with money. Well, if it is related to anything, it's related to that time when we just didn't have very much. We made do with a lot of things without suffering to any extent, but I remember all these people who were worse off coming to the house looking for work and handouts, etc.  The pre-Depression era was the Prohibition period. There was a lot of bootlegging going on, and there was a lot in the papers and radio about their operations. People who never drank before started drinking, I guess, just because it was harder to get the stuff. It was more fashionable, and things like martinis were introduced. My parents didn't drink, but I suppose occasionally there was some homemade wine. But there was a lot of crime related to bootlegging, and I guess that's how the Mafia and other crime groups really got their start. My family didn't approve of our relatives in Freehold because they had access to alcohol through bootlegging. My father told me years later that when he had the poultry farm and was selling eggs, he was approached by that element and asked if he would use his connections in shipping eggs to places to include forbidden liquor, etc. He turned them down because he was a very moral person, but it would have been really nice additional income for my family, I'm sure. But he was a very honest person, and we didn't have liquor in the house except wine very occasionally. And there was no profanity in our house.    Ms. West: Were you a great reader when you were young?    Mr. Owen: I have always been a very great reader. I read every book we had in our own little modest library. As a little boy I was reading adult materials by the time I was seven or eight years old. I soon discovered that these friends of ours on Barkers Hill had a walk-in closet on the second floor. It was as big as this room but narrower, and it was just absolutely full of paperbacks of the most exciting types. There were ones about World War II airplane exploits and ones like Argosy, which was an adventure magazine. They weren't nearly as pornographic as everyday reading is today by any means. Downstairs in their library in their bookcase, they had quite a few adult books.    Ms. West: Did you have a favorite author?    Mr. Owen: All of them. I was reading Raphael Sabatini when I was eight and nine years old. Earlier my family got me books, and I read the X Bar Boys set and another set on submarines. Then in high school, when we had to read books for credit for English, all the hard books got much more credit. So I read almost all of Dickens in high school, because I could get sixty points for one of those books instead of twenty points for something else. I missed out in my operating and professional years because I just didn't have time to do much reading. I was too busy doing other things. I would say I have read several hundred books since I retired. It's a wonderful library system they have here in Monmouth County  I am mostly using the West Long Branch Library. When we were celebrating our bicentennial,  I was seeking out library books relating to our history, particularly the Revolutionary history. Now rather than always reading best sellers, I confess that I have come around to a lazy but interesting way of looking over the discarded books at the library that one time were free and now are something like fifty cents. If I see something I'm interested in, I buy it. So it has given me a great variety. Now and then I read books related to my overseas experience. Here's one about Moscow. We were there in Moscow during both the Stalin period and the Krushev period. And I remember a lot of these things. Often when I was in Washington, I was on the Soviet Desk. I was a Soviet Desk Officer, and later on the Deputy Director for Soviet Affairs in the State Department. I was in Moscow twice, and our youngest son was born in Moscow. That wasn't on purpose, but he came early --Thanksgiving instead of Christmas.    Ms. West: How many children did you have?    Mr. Owen: We have had three boys and a girl. Only one boy was born in the United States. The oldest boy was born in the Dominican Republic, and the girl was born in Nuremberg, Germany. The next boy got his start, you might say in Germany, but was born in Bethesda, Maryland, and then our youngest one was born in Moscow, which is a whole story in itself.    Ms. West: How did you get involved with the Foreign Service?    Mr. Owen: Purely by accident. After Rutgers, I did a year's graduate work at MIT, working on my Doctor of Science Degree in the Department of Metallurgy. The Navy came along and was offering people commissions at the beginning of World War II, and they told me they wouldn't think of taking me until after I got my advanced degree. They figured I would be much more valuable to them then. And of course, three months later, I got my orders and went for three and a half years into the Navy. I was in a technical specialty relating to engineering. My wife tried to encourage my coming back by writing to President Roosevelt telling him it was "time my husband came home." And that's the first time she wrote a President, but she has written every President since then. We still have one of the answers from Roosevelt's office in our scrapbook. After I came back from the South Pacific, I came down with infectious hepatitis. It was before they knew much about it, but there were thousands of returning veterans who came down with it. The only thing you could do for it n those days was complete bed rest and a fat-free diet.  So I was in a hospital in New York. I had been back a month before I came down with it. I had been working at the Brooklyn Navy Yard. So then I was in the hospital on this horrible diet, and I was getting thoroughly sick of raspberry Jell-O. We got a notice that came through the mail channels, and it was very slow getting to me. It was a Navy notice about this opportunity to take an examination for the American Foreign Service. I didn't even know what it was at the time. So that one particular afternoon, when my wife visited me in the hospital, we decided it wouldn't hurt to apply. I didn't want to go back to MIT and finish up on my doctorate, even though they were holding a place for me. I wanted to be working with people. I read countless books when I wasn't too busy overseas on little tropical islands. Anyway, I read lots of books on all the things I had missed out on in engineering education like botany, history, etc. So we decided to send the application in. Later I found out that when they received it in the State Department, they thought I was sort of a crazy fellow. I had given them this long list of things I read overseas instead of academic credits. So they wanted to see if I could pass the exam and gave me a chance. I took the exam. I was half an hour late getting to the right place, because they had switched the places for the exam, and it was a whole day exam. But I was relaxed and just took it as a mental exercise. They didn't tell me how I did right away, so I went and did some graduate work at Princeton in International Affairs. Then they told me I had passed that exam. They asked me if I would like to take the oral examination in Washington on a certain date, or I could postpone until I finished my work at Princeton. I told them I would take it, and my wife and I went to Washington on a train. I passed the oral exam and was offered a position at the most junior level for an officer, like a second lieutenant. So I thought I would try it and see how I liked it. Well, thirty years later, I retired. We have strayed quite a bit from talking about Monmouth County. I had an aunt and uncle who lived on Broad Street in Freehold. At that point, you could see the racetrack area from their front porch. There was just a jungle of weeds and little trees between them and the racetrack, which is now houses, of course. When they had Fourth of July fireworks, you could sit on their front porch and watch the fireworks at the racetrack. That was rather special.    Ms. West: Did you have any hobbies when you were a youngster?    Mr. Owen: I suppose you could say so. I was interested in stamp collecting for awhile. My mother's oldest sister, Emma, lived in Trenton. She married very late someone who was considerably her junior and really had no gainful means of support. He was a cultured, educated man with a moustache, which was rare in those days. He came from a very good Trenton family, which commended him considerably. We never had a chance to talk very much with her around, but he was a good husband to her, I guess. He had come in to all these stamps that he collected as a boy and inherited some from someone else. At one stage, he gave me several books of these stamps. They were mostly American stamps, and one or two pre-Revolutionary stamps. So that gave my collecting quite a boost. He also gave me a huge collection of shells from all over that he had acquired. They were all in little cases with glass on top with labels, etc. But it was a little bit jumbled, and I was too young. The first thing you know, they got more jumbled. And there was never anything made of them, and they were eventually thrown out, I suppose. The stamps were a hobby, but certainly the shells never became one. I was so active, particularly in high school, that I didn't have much chance for hobbies. Walking back after track practice, I picked up matchbox covers. So I had quite a collection of different matchbox covers. But then at one stage, I was getting bored with that. I dated a girl in high school named Katherine Chagaris who had a younger brother that was collecting matchbooks. So I gave the whole batch to him.    Ms. West: How long have you and your wife been married?    Mr. Owen: We married in 1942 at the Rutgers Chapel. The Dean officiated at our wedding and we walked out of the chapel under crossed swords, because at that point, I was just graduating from Fort Schuyler Naval Training School up north in the Bronx somewhere. I was sent there for my first training assignment in the Navy. There were eight or ten of us in my unit, and they borrowed swords from the instructors. That same uncle in Trenton had been a Navy Ensign in World War I, and still had some of his uniform and his sword. So his sword was used among those swords that were held in an arch for us. The reception was at Woodlawn at Douglass, which is quite an estate. My wife was working there that year while I was at MIT. So that was really quite fancy. We took a train to New York for our honeymoon, and we stayed at one of the hotels there. Then we got up very early on Monday morning so I could get back to Fort Schuyler, where we had our last strength tests, etc.    Ms. West: If you could describe your life as a roadmap, how would you describe it?    Mr. Owen: There were a lot of detours, but it was sort of focused on the central highway of career service, being a parent, raising a family, and adjusting to the special needs of living abroad so much in often a hostile climate. Educating children in the Foreign Service, moving around from place to place, is very much like it is in the military when they move from post to post. Except in our case, almost all the posts were abroad. My last post abroad was in Yugoslavia. I was the American Council General responsible for Croatia and Slovenia. I wasn't under close observation or supervision by the Embassy in Belgrade. The recent events there have been very painful for us with all the killings and racial divisions. It was an extremely interesting life in the Foreign Service. I always like variety, and I certainly had variety. I started out as an Administrative Officer, then I had Public Affairs responsibilities while I was still an Administrative Officer. Then I was the Economic Reporting Officer and a Labor Reporting Officer in Finland. I was a Political Reporting Officer in Moscow, and had more Public Affairs responsibilities, in a sense, there. Later, I had sort of Intelligence related responsibilities in charge of an office in Germany during the period of the Hungarian uprising. My team would interview detectors and refugees for matters of interest to the State Department. So it has been an interesting variety. And in the Foreign Service I had a lot of responsibility right from the start.    Ms. West: What would you say is your greatest achievement?    Mr. Owen: I couldn't really pick one out. Both my wife and I have been extremely active in Monmouth County and the state, in environmental related issues in most cases. She has been strictly environmental, and I was on the Citizen's Advisory Board for the Manasquan Reservoir Project when that came along. My group had opposed developing it because we thought the same amount of water could be achieved through water conservation methods. When it turned out we couldn't stop it, I "joined up," becoming Chairman of the Environmental Task Force of the Citizens Advisory Board for the project.    Ms. West: What year was that?    Mr. Owen: In July they are going to be celebrating their twentieth anniversary of the reservoir having been completed.    Ms. West: You have been involved since its inception, right?    Mr. Owen: I was involved before the first shovel was dug. This might have been one of the more important things I have done in life. We made it a much more environment-friendly reservoir than it might have been otherwise. It's not just a hole filled with water. There is a beautiful County-run park around it. There are no motor boats to pollute the water, it's only sail boats or non-gasoline powered boats. There are horse trails, too. I am proud of that. I'm also proud of what I did in Yugoslavia. There was no schooling for English speaking children there. People suggested to me how wonderful it would be to have an American school there. So I got support from the State Department to establish a school there. So I am really the founder of the American school there. At one stage there were maybe thirty children in eight grades, and we had several teachers and some aides. We had maybe five or six different nationalities  it wasn't just Americans.    Ms. West: Is there anything else you would like to accomplish?    Mr. Owen: I have gathered quite a lot of genealogical information about our families. I have a whole file of miscellaneous papers that need to be organized and then followed up on. That's one of my ambitions. And I am fulfilling another ambition today talking to you. I have a lot of memories of various periods in my life that I would like to get down on the record. Some years ago, I started trying to give my children a lot of this information I have bottled up in me. They didn't seem all that interested, so I started writing it in a form that could be used in the Asbury Park Press "Remember When" column. I must have had maybe fifty pieces printed in the Press over the years. Then I sent copies to the children so they would get it that way. I hope to have the discipline soon to spend the time to get this information down. I may participate in an ongoing oral history project at the State Department. I did participate in one at Rutgers on History Archives of World War II.    Ms. West: Well I thank you for sharing your memories with us today. This has been extremely interesting.     
MonmouthCounty;Marie Busch;1905;2000;Marie Busch, 1905, 2000          Remembering The 20th Century: An Oral History Of Monmouth County      Marie Busch, present day  Date of Interview: January 31, 2000  Name of Interviewer: Flora Higgins  Premises of Interview: Mrs. Busch's home, Matawan, NJ  Birth date of subject: March 23, 1905  Deceased: July 1, 2002    Ms. Higgins:  Thanks to you, Mr. Robert Chevalier, for organizing and attending this interview. Mrs. Busch, how did you happen to get to Matawan?  How did your folks get here?    Ms. Busch:  Pop and Mom came here when Karl was born  I guess that was 1892. And before that, they lived down on Atlantic Ave. in Aberdeen Township.  And then before that, they lived in Lawrence Harbor.  Lena and Herman and maybe Karl were born in Lawrence Harbor.  There were ten children in all.  I'm second to the last.      The Dietrich family   (click to enlarge)  Mr. Chevalier: Tell us about the farm.    Ms. Busch: Well, when I was born, Pop just had the five acres, and there were thirty-two acres across the street and fifty-three acres up on the other side of Lloyd Road, and that's what we farmed.      Ms. Higgins: What kind of farming did your family do?    Ms. Busch: Just general farming, vegetables, corn for the animals, because we did it all with horses  it was a lot of hard work.  We had pigs in the pig house and we had chickens in the chicken house.  We built the chicken houses in the 1930s, when there was a boom in the egg industry.    Ms. Higgins: Chicken farming was big here.    Ms. Busch: Yes, Pop built all the buildings in the 1930s.  We had cows, and horses, and pigs.  Oh, we milked the cows. My mother would always milk the cows.  My mother was a really hard working woman, she always worked out in the fields very hard.  After working in the fields one evening, Momma came in and was getting supper ready. Then, she sat at the table and I saw her fall asleep. I felt sorry for her, so one day I learned the technique in order to milk a cow.  I went out in the barn and I milked the cows and brought the milk in.   I came in and I strained the milk, and I took the cloth, washed the cloth out, hung it up whereMom had it hung up.  After she woke up, she went to milk the cow.  She said something about the cow being dry. I said, "What's wrong with the cow?" She said, "I didn't get any milk."  Then Momma came in and went to strain the milk and the cloth was still wet.  She said, "I don't know what happened." Then she realized that I had milked the cows.     Ms. Higgins: Did you tell her you had already milked the cow?    Ms. Busch:  That was a breeze job for Momma when she milked the cow.       Ms. Higgins: How old were you?    Ms. Busch: I was pretty young, about eleven or twelve years old.    Ms. Higgins: So you milked the cow after that all the time?    Ms. Busch: Oh, yes, it was my job to milk the cows  we always had two cows. I never worked in the house.  I was a very poor housekeeper.  I still am.  Of course,  I had a younger sister, Lillian, and she used to do the housework. My mother used to go out in the morning and get vegetables and she'd make a big pot of soup full of vegetables.  We were raised all on vegetables.  The only thing you got was a small piece of meat that we paid for at the butcher shop, and that was put in the pot.  She'd take all the vegetables in the farm and she put them in a pot.    Ms. Higgins: Oh, I bet that was wonderful.    Ms. Busch: Oh, it was. Every summer as soon as school closed up, people from New York, Jersey City, Newark, and Elizabeth came down here  I don't know where they even slept.    Ms. Higgins: Why did they come? What did they come for?    Mr. Chevalier:  Because their folks didn't want to have them sitting around in the summer getting into trouble. They came for fresh air, too.    Ms. Higgins: They came to your farm here?    Mr. Chevalier: Yes, oh, yes.  They stayed here all summer.    Ms. Busch: Yes, as soon as school closed, they'd bring their kids down and they would leave them here until it was time for them to go back to school again.    Ms. Higgins: Well, that gave you plenty of playmates.    Ms. Busch: Yes, oh, yes.  They were all younger than me  and I was the boss.      Ms. Higgins: What kind of games did you play?    Mr. Chevalier: I don't think we really played games. But see there's a creek here  Mohingson Brook runs through the property, and they spent their time there. At noontime they would come home for lunch.    Ms. Busch: Papa would lie down and go to sleep.  Papa would take his nap, and we'd go down to the creek and follow the creek all the way up to Lloyd Road and come back again. Of course, it was the hot part of the day, you know.    Ms. Higgins: That's the creek I crossed over to come here.  What about the old mill?      The Old Grist Mill on the farm in 1892    Ms. Busch:  On the other side of the creek, there was an old mill, I don't know how many hundreds of  years old it was, that had a millstone.  It had an outside water wheel that provided the power to grind up the flour, and all the rich people in Matawan had an investment. It  was built in the Township, but the owners lived in the Borough.  Of course, it was all Matawan and there was no Aberdeen then, it was all Matawan.    Mr. Chevalier: It was Matawan Borough and Matawan Township. I don't even know when it split. Maybe it was all one at one time: I don't know.    Ms. Busch:  According to the old deed, this was all one piece of property. The mill used to grind the flour there and all the aristocrats in Matawan had an interest or investment  in that mill. I don't remember too much about the transaction because I was a baby.  Oh, my brother and sister went over there to play.  In order to get up the stairs, I had to carry my little sister Lillian.  We used to always like to go up in the hayloft. The millstones are there still.  They used the top of the old mill to store hay for their animals, and the animals were downstairs.     Ms. Higgins: So now, your mother was working, your father was sleeping, and you children are playing in the mill in the hayloft?    Ms. Busch: Yes.  That was our recreation.  My youngest sister Lillian was so small, I carried her, and we used to have to climb steps, because there wasn't a ladder there, and there were boards and nails between the beams that you had to watch out for  that's how we climbed upstairs.  We used to go out into the field and cut the hay and take the hay down there.  This was all with horses  and you took the hay and threw it up in the hayloft. Rob's mother, my sister, and I used to always get the job way up in the top of the mill, way up in the eaves, to push the hay back.    Ms. Higgins: Is that because you were small and could fit in there?    Ms. Busch: Yes.    Ms. Higgins: Did you ever ride the horses for fun?    Ms. Busch: Yes!! Oh yes!!! I had a stallion that I used to ride around, and of course back in those days, getting on a horse and riding the horse at that stage was terrible.      Jacob Dietrich Jr. and Marie Dietrich Busch, with Prince (horse) on the farm, 1940  Ms. Higgins: Let alone a stallion.    Ms. Busch: I used to ride down Lloyd Road and all around.    Ms. Higgins: What was his name?    Ms. Busch: Prince.  Oh, we had so many horses. Prince was a white horse, and Tom was the other.     Ms. Higgins: And did you ride the horse to school?    Ms. Busch: No.  We walked to school.  When we went to school in the wintertime, when we had had a really bad winter storm, up here on the hill the snow was from one hill to another, and we'd walk over here and walk in the field up over the hill to go to the school.  It was about a mile to the school.    Ms. Higgins: Did you stay there all day and have a nice hot lunch?    Ms. Busch: No, we'd get out at twelve noon, and come running home for soup, a big pot of soup. We'd come home and get our hot soup and then we went back to school again. I guess that's why I have lived to be ninety-four.    Ms. Higgins: How did your family preserve all the vegetables that they grew?    Ms. Busch: There was no cellar in the house.  My mother didn't like that, she wanted one, so she went in the front and started digging the dirt out.  Of course, us kids had to take this dirt away.  I don't know what year it was.  Then we had somebody in here to raise or jack the house up.    Ms. Higgins: Did you raise this house?    Ms. Busch: No, no the other part of the house.    Mr. Chevalier: This part is 1918.    Ms. Busch: But the other part is all beams and the walls all filled with rock  brick lined.      Ms. Higgins: And this was lifted?  How did they do it?      Ms. Busch: They had four screw jacks on each corner of the house and they went around from one to another and  just turned them to raise the house up.  There was a man in Matawan who lived in back of the school who did that.  Then he built a brick wall for us, along with the basement walls.      Ms. Higgins: That your mother had dug out.    Ms. Busch:  My mother started digging it out, but of course, when the boys came along they all had to do it.  We dug it all out.    Ms. Higgins: I recognize the technique. Well, you obviously got a good education. Did you stop going to school after the Matawan School?    Ms. Busch:  No. I'm the only one in the family who went on  all the rest quit in the sixth grade and got a job somewhere. One went to the butcher shop, another to Harry's Blacksmith Shop in Morganville.        Mr. Chevalier: Talk about school.    Ms. Busch: One year we had a terrible winter freeze and the snow was up on the hill from one hill to the other.  We went up on people's property.  We went up over the hill and I said,  "Why do I go to school?"    Ms. Higgins: How many children went with you?      Ms. Busch: My sister and I were the last ones in the family, and we'd sit out here and wait by the road for the other children.  Everybody would come down Church Street and the whole gang would come, and when they came we would leave.  By the time we got to Matawan school, it was a big crowd of us coming.  We didn't fit in Matawan, you know, we weren't aristocrats and Matawan was full of aristocrats.    Ms. Higgins:  I see.  Where did they go on to school?    Ms. Busch:  I don't know.    Mr. Chevalier: They got their own private schools, too.    Ms. Busch: Every weekend we would go to my grandmother's in Cliffwood.  We'd go on a Friday night, and stay at Grandma's, and come walking home from Cliffwood to Matawan School on Monday. You know that's quite a walk.    Ms. Higgins: That is quite a walk, yes. But the train left from here, didn't it?    Ms. Busch: The train station was in Matawan, but it didn't stop in Cliffwood, and the next stop was South Amboy. My mother used to say that when she used to go over to Grandma's she would take the stagecoach in the morning and come back for school.  We would leave Friday night and go to Grandma's and Monday morning we would leave Grandma's in Cliffwood and we would come walking on the tracks, even though we weren't supposed to walk on the railroad tracks. You had Aberdeen Road down below there. Grandma's was right on the highway, right down where the stores were.  I don't know if the house is still there or not.      Ms. Higgins: Tell us about  walking on the tracks.    Mr. Chevalier: It was an all wooden trestle across there.    Ms. Busch: And of course, it was against the law, but it was a short cut right across from Matawan Creek. And we would go that way: it was another mile up to the school.    Ms. Higgins: You said the Italians came to town and you'd all walk to school together.    Ms. Busch: Yes, the crowd came, and then we would all walk to school together. I was the only one that went to eighth grade and spent a half a year in high school, and I wanted to go through high school, but Pop said, "No, Marie, you have to come home with me sometime and go to work."  But it was funny: I had to come home from high school, but I could go to vocational school. In 1920 my sister Bertha got married and lived in Sayreville up on the hill, and I was living with her, so I could go to vocational school in New Brunswick. It was an hour's trolley car ride from Sayreville to New Brunswick.  There was a trolley car then on Main Street in Sayreville and we'd walk down and meet everybody  all the guys in Sayreville, the boys and girls  I lived there with my sister and it would take an hour to ride from Sayerville to New Brunswick to go to vocational school.    Ms. Higgins: What did you study?    Ms. Busch: Sewing and cooking and academics. In academics, I graduated as Valedictorian.    Ms. Higgins: Congratulations!    Ms. Busch: See, vocational school only took dropouts in seventh grade.  Ms. Mallock, my academic teacher, said to me, "Will you to get up and say Lincoln's Gettysburg Address?"  Each student was assigned a paragraph.  So she told me to get up and say it and I recited the whole thing. She didn't remember  that I had gone to eighth grade and half a year of high school.  I was the only one in the family to go past the seventh grade.  My eighth grade teacher was Mrs. Gittens, and when she taught you something, you knew it.  She was very strict about it.  So when she said to get up and say the Lincoln's Gettysburg's Address, I went through the whole thing: "Four score and seven years ago, our forefathers...."  In vocational school they put me in this office because I learned the whole thing by going through eighth grade and a half a year in high school.       Ms. Higgins: Did your parents speak German in the home? Do you speak German now?    Ms. Busch: Oh, yes.     Ms. Higgins:  You're bilingual?    Ms. Busch: Oh, yes, we could understand and speak German.  I forgot it, though.    Mr. Chevalier: Your mother only spoke German to the children.    Ms. Busch: Yes.    Mr. Chevalier: She could understand English and she could talk English, but she only spoke German. But Marie's father, he spoke in English, unless he got mad, and then he spoke in German.    Ms. Busch: Yes, because in Germany you had to go in the army when you reached a certain age.  And they wanted Pop to re-enlist. Pop said no.  He couldn't do it, and came to America.  Mom came to America, but she always wanted to go to Australia. This was all about 1880.    Ms. Higgins: What an adventurous woman.    Ms. Busch:  But when she came to New York, Pop went to work in the sugar house, and in those days, while you worked you just had pants on.    Mr. Chevalier: Well, I guess when she got to New York she wanted to earn enough money to buy her passage to Australia.    Ms. Busch: Yes, that's what she wanted to do.    Ms. Higgins: What was her maiden name?    Mr. Chevalier: Well, it's Woge.    Ms. Busch: In Germany, before she left, her father died and her and a girl from Poland said, "Come on, we'll get out."  Mom said to the women, "Will you do the housework?  And I'll go out?"  Mom used to go out with all the men and work and bundle the hay.  Well, I guess that's what she liked to do.  Mom was a very hard working woman, very hard.  In the morning she would make a pot of vegetable soup.    Ms. Higgins: How did she make this soup? I love soup so much.  Tell me about it what would she put in there?    Ms. Busch: She'd go to a butcher shop, and she'd get a piece of meat this big, usually a piece of shin bone, and she put that in the pot and then she'd go out in the garden and she'd pick all kinds of vegetables out of the garden. That was mom's job in the morning. In the morning, she'd get this great big pot that would hold about five gallons, and she'd put all those vegetables in it.    Mr. Chevalier: So did she cook it on the gas stove or on the electric stove?    Ms. Busch: Gas, electric? Are you kidding?  Wood stove!  She'd put it all in the pot and she'd cook that and then we always had boys from all over. Everybody would say, "Can we leave our boy in the summer time?" All over Newark and Elizabeth and Jersey City and all over. The city people whose children were here would come on Sunday to visit them.    Ms. Higgins: Were they Irish or African American, or Italians?    Mr. Chevalier: Everything. I think there were a lot of Germans.  Yes, I think they were mostly of German extraction.    Ms. Busch: Evidently, everyone would ask to leave their boy for the summer.  Today I wonder where in God's name they ever slept.  Of course, when they go out in the field everybody had their work to do.    Mr. Chevalier: What did you do in the morning when you first got up in the summer time?    Ms. Busch: Milk the cows.    Mr. Chevalier: And then what else?    Ms. Busch: I forgot.    Mr. Chevalier: What about the asparagus?    Ms. Busch: Oh, yes.  Up by Lloyd Road up there, Pop planted asparagus.     Mr. Chevalier: You have to cut the asparagus as soon as the heads....    Ms. Busch: Come out of the ground. You had to cut it down near the root.    Mr. Chevalier: It was very tender.    Ms. Busch: We used to always have to pick those asparagus up before we went to school in the morning. I often wonder how  we did that.    Ms. Higgins: It's not supposed to get the sun on it, right?    Mr. Chevalier: Yes.    Ms. Higgins: And was it white when it came up?    Mr. Chevalier: Yes.    Ms. Busch: That was bleached asparagus.    Mr. Chevalier: And then you didn't go to school.  You stayed home and rested.    Ms. Busch: No.    Mr. Chevalier: How did you know it was time to go home and go to school?    Ms. Busch:  Mom was here by the big pot of soup, and she used to call from here, and we'd hear her way up on Lloyd Road.  Then we'd come running home quick.     Ms. Higgins: Oh, I bet that soup was wonderful.    Ms. Busch: Yes.  That was cooked on a wood stove.    Ms. Higgins: Where did you get the wood?    Ms. Busch: Anywhere.  I had to go out and cut it.    Mr. Chevalier: That was the winter project after the crops were all done.  They had a big saw rig, and they would have these piles of logs, all sizes, and then they would cut them and they would have a pile, as big as these two rooms, of wood, which was the winter supply of wood.    Ms. Busch:  It was used in the wood burning stove and in the furnace here that heats the house.    Mr. Chevalier:  What did you want to be when you grew up?    Ms. Busch:  A nurse. I always wanted to be a nurse. The brain is so dried up, it's surprising how much you forget, but little by little it comes back. And I can still read the paper, thank God for that.    Ms. Higgins: Well, you are certainly very, very pleasant to talk to and I am enjoying this. I interviewed a gentleman Friday who is ninety-four.  He also liked Abraham Lincoln and was quoting from Abraham Lincoln, also.    Mr. Chevalier:  Is that right?    Ms. Higgins: Isn't that amazing? He quoted  from the "With malice toward none, with charity for all," speech. He has a lot of pictures of Lincoln  he loves Abraham Lincoln.  How did you meet your handsome husband?    Ms. Busch: I went to work in New York in the wintertime taking care of children.  I took care of a little Jewish boy, I think he was two or two and a half.  I used to walk him from 53th Street, all the way up to Grant's Tomb.  I know he didn't walk all the way up to Grant's Tomb  I must have had a baby carriage. The family had a dry goods store, and the parents were down at the store when I was taking care him.  I'd put him to bed in the morning, and after he took his nap he would get up and have something to eat.  I'd make his lunch for him at noontime.  Then, I got him all dressed and I'd take him down and we'd go to the store and I'd say, "Go say bye to your mommy and daddy."  I could work until March, but when March came, Pop said, "Come on Marie, you have to come home.  We have to make the hot bed."  So, I had to come home and make the hot bed.    Ms. Higgins: Wel,l that's a long walk you had in New York. You got practice going back and forth to school.    Ms. Busch: When I got to Grant's Tomb, I would stop and sit down on a bench.  He'd play around with all the kids in the park where all the kids would play.  And then we'd sit there for a couple of hours.  I often wondered what I ate. We ate lunch before we left. We'd walk back to 53rd Street and I'd take him upstairs and I'd get him something to eat. I saw how they lived in New York, and I saw beautiful homes. It's all different here.  It's all railroad tracks.    Ms. Higgins: How did you meet your husband?    Ms. Busch: Well, that's another story.    Ms. Higgins: What was his name?    Ms. Busch:  George Busch. These Jewish people I worked for had the back apartment and my husband lived downstairs where the store was.      Mr. Chevalier: Go on about how you met him.    Ms. Busch: Sister Lillian and Bill Wuarman and George were friends, but I had not met him. The Buschs lived in the same apartment house as they did, but I never met my husband. They'd be downstairs when we visited New York. But I never met my husband until I was taking care of this little Jewish boy and Bill Wuarman called to George, George came back to meet me. George and my sister's husband were friends, and that's how I met my husband. I was introduced to him.    Mr. Chevalier: What year was that? How long before you got married?    Ms. Busch: I can't remember. It was a couple of years.    Ms. Higgins: What did he do?    Ms. Busch: George was working for a Gulf Oil company in New York. He had a good job at the time. Then Gulf Oil left there and the Depression came.  And then George was the first one laid off.  He had a good job in New York, then Gulf Oil moved to South America, and then he had to go get another job.  He didn't want to go to South America. And George and my brother-in-law, Bill Wuarman, would come down on the weekend   he'd come down and spend the weekend, because he didn't want any part of New York City. We had the railroad to New York City.    Ms. Higgins: So after you got married, you came back here to live?    Ms. Busch: Well, he used to come here every weekend.    Ms. Higgins: Why did he do that?    Ms. Busch: Because he didn't like New York.    Ms. Higgins: He liked you  I think that's why he came down.    Ms. Busch: When he used to come down he used to go out in the field with me and work with me in the field. He knew absolutely nothing about field work, because they had a store. They owned a delicatessen store.    Mr. Chevalier: Tell them about his parents.    Ms. Busch: His parents came from Germany, of course, and they had this big deli with a grocery store on Amsterdam Avenue in New York. And then after a while, the store closed or they sold it or something.    Mr. Chevalier:  Where did your husband go to work after he lost his job?    Ms. Busch:  He had to go to work with his father in the deli grocery store on Amsterdam Avenue, because he couldn't find any other jobs.  That was in that bad Depression we had, before 1932, so he had to work for his father, and traveled by train six days a week to New York City.    Mr. Chevalier: What kind of car did you have?    Ms. Busch: I forget, but I would take him down to the station and I'd drop him off there and wait until he went and got on the train, and he would go on the train to New York.  I think he made twenty dollars a week or something like that. There was no money around during the Depression.    Mr. Chevalier: What time did George leave to go to New York City to work?    Ms. Busch: Oh, if I took him down at eight o'clock in the morning, he would usually come home earlier, but most of the time he would say, "Wait a while and take me down," and then he wouldn't come home until eleven o'clock at night. I lived in Matawan on Main Street at the time.    Ms. Higgins: So you weren't on the farm then?    Ms. Busch: Oh, yes.  My brother Fred had a house over there, and I don't remember what we paid for it.  It was a big house, and after I picked up George from the train, I used to take George home.  We used to park by the street first and then the car got hit on Main Street in Matawan, so my brother Fred got a whole lot of barrels, great big tin barrel, and he made a driveway. So we could run down the back yard.    Mr. Chevalier: The house was right next to a gully.    Ms. Busch: There was stream there, and brother Fred took these barrels and he put these barrels in this way and this way, until he built a wall for our car to go down. I guess it was a Model A Ford.  Then we could drive down the hill into the back yard.    Ms. Higgins: That must have been thrilling.    Ms. Busch: And we left it there.    Mr. Chevalier: A gravel bank and a gravel driveway to go up and down the hill.  What did you do all day?    Ms. Busch: I took George down to the station to go to New York to work for his father.  The monthly train fare to New York was nineteen dollars a month during the Depression. I would come drive over here to the farm, and then go out in the field.      Marie Dietrich Busch and her husband, George Busch, on their wedding day, 1932    Ms. Higgins:  Was this before or after you were married?    Mr. Chevalier: After.    Ms. Higgins: What year did you get married?    Ms. Busch: 1932.    Ms. Higgins: So he was working in the city and you were working in the field and he probably worked in the fields on the weekends during the season.  In the wintertime, what did you do? Do you remember the rivers and creeks freezing over? Did you ever go ice-skating?    Ms. Busch: Oh, yes, we used to go out ice skating on the lakes in Matawan. My sister and I used to always walk down to the lake in Matawan and go ice skating from Main Street to all the way down to the Dam.     Mr. Chevalier: How about cultivating in the fields with your brother?    Ms. Busch: My brother was three years older than I was, and my sister was three years younger than me.  We'd go to school, and Pop would come down when we got home from school. Pop would have a cup a tea and something to eat, and he'd say, "Well, you clean the house."  Of course, my sister didn't like outside work.  I'd go outside with Pop and then work until dark.  We'd work on the farm until dark.    Mr. Chevalier: How about cultivating with your brother? They spread fish. They used to go to the fisheries and pick up garbage at the fisheries.    Ms. Higgins: Fish entrails and all?    Mr. Chevalier: The entrails and all the skeletons, and they'd spread them on the field.    Ms. Higgins: I understand the American Indians did that with the fish, too.    Ms. Busch:  Vernon used to come and he used to always work with Pop, and Rob used to work with me in the field. Vernon and Rob are my nephews.    Mr. Chevalier: How did they make hot beds?    Ms. Busch: You had to dig deep and put manure in the bottom, and then you had to put dirt on top.  After you put dirt on top of that and then we'd make rows and plant the seeds.    Ms. Higgins:  Was this farm still actively working and growing vegetables right through the Depression?    Mr. Chevalier: When Levitts came in 1962, they sold the last piece of the big end of the farm,  and were left with six acres.    Ms. Busch: Of course, we never farmed this part then because we didn't need it. We had thirty-one acres over there.    Mr. Chevalier: Another fifty-three acres all the way up to Holmdel Township, which is Line Road. If you follow Church Street all the way up to Line Road that was what they originally used to farm.    Ms. Busch: And they used to cultivate it with the horses.    Ms. Higgins: I was going to ask you if you had tractors?    Ms. Busch: No. We had horses.      Mr. Chevalier: Who did the cultivating?    Ms. Busch: Fred and I did. Fred had a single horse with one cultivator, and I had the same.    Mr. Chevalier: How did you do it?    Ms. Busch: We cultivated down this row, and we went back up on this side, and went around that side, and came up on the next row. That's the way we did the cultivating.     Mr. Chevalier: They used a single horse and a hand cultivator. A cultivator with maybe five to six teeth on it, and you just kept going.    Ms. Busch: See, that's why I have the muscle.    Mr. Chevalier: They used to plant in squares.    Ms. Busch: Yes, so you could cultivate in both directions.      Ms. Higgins: Your father must have had to hire help?     Ms. Busch: No.      Ms. Higgins: He did all that with horses and the family?    Ms. Busch: We had kids from New York in the summertime.    Ms. Higgins: But they were gone by harvest time, and that's the busy time.    Ms. Busch: There were five boys and four of them were always here. When George and I got married, we used to go up to Freehold and pick up my sister Lil's daughter, and then from there we would ride over to Sayreville and pick up the Sayreville boys. Then they'd go to the movies and Lil had a fit, because her daughter was gorgeous and would see those terrible movies. My sister  used to say, "I want you to stop taking my daughter to see those terrible movies." I said, "When your daughter is with my husband, he can take her anywhere she wants to go."    Mr. Chevalier: Well, by this time, her sister was divorced from her husband, so she was a single mother.    Ms. Busch: I was supposed to be the last one in the family and that is why I was named after my mother, because I was the last daughter born. But then sister Lil came along two years after me.     Ms. Higgins:  Are you in Matawan or Aberdeen?    Ms. Busch: Aberdeen now. We were Matawan before that.    Mr. Chevalier: Well, it was Matawan Township until they changed from Matawan Township to Aberdeen Township because of the confusion between Matawan Borough and Matawan Township.    Ms. Busch: Of course we knew everybody then. Today you don't know anybody. And then when Levitt came, they took all the country, all the farmland. They built it all up, and they changed the name to Aberdeen.    Mr. Chevalier: Where did you keep all the vegetables for the winter before you had the cellar?    Ms. Busch: We canned them.  We did a lot of canning.    Mr. Chevalier: How about the carrots and the cabbage and the beets and things like that?    Ms. Busch: Oh, that I can tell you. We would take a large piece of ground, and we would pack the carrots and the beets all the way around the bottom, and bring it up to a mound.    Mr. Chevalier: With what did you cover it?    Ms. Busch: Grass and weeds. We covered that all up, and on the south side of the pile we had a hole. It was all covered with hay and straw and everything you know so it would freeze, and then we'd dig out the dirt out of that side and bring out carrots and beets and stuff like that all winter long.    Ms. Higgins: Potatoes, too?    Ms. Busch: Everything. We raised everything. This stuff would last all winter. After we got that big high mound made, we'd cover the produce up with all kinds of straw and all kinds of roots and everything. It was all covered up so it would not freeze.    Ms. Higgins: Did you grow any fruit?    Ms. Busch: No, we didn't grow fruit. Apple trees would come up by themselves. They were there when Pop came here.    Mr. Chevalier: You grew raspberries.    Ms. Busch: Oh, raspberries, oh yes.    Mr. Chevalier: Marie still grows raspberries.    Ms. Busch: Raspberries or strawberries.    Mr. Chevalier: She was picking raspberries this year until, I think, the first part of November.    Ms. Higgins: You're growing your own raspberries?    Ms. Busch: Oh, yes. Everybody left home except my brother Fred. He stayed with me until the one year he planted tomatoes real early up along Lloyd Road and they froze.    Mr. Chevalier: At night they covered the hot beds with big glass panes and then with salt hay, maybe ten to twelve inches of it, so in case you got a frost it would not freeze the crop.    Ms. Busch: Before the tractors came, brother Fred had a horse and I had a horse. Not only our place. Pop rented ground all over. He planted corn for the horses and animals. And boy, I'm telling you, there was so much stuff to plant, and so much we grew.    Ms. Higgins: Did the boys start to leave home then, during the war?    Ms. Busch: Herman and Karl were in the war.    Ms. Higgins: That's the First World War.    Mr. Chevalier: The First World War, yes. They were in the army.    Ms. Busch: Karl was in Germany.    Mr. Chevalier: Yes. He got gassed in Germany with mustard gas. Was Herman in the war, or did he get out of the army before the war?    Ms. Busch: Herman got out of the army, and then Karl joined the army. After Karl joined, he landed in Italy and came across to Germany. He had a set-back, too. And brother Fred is the only one that stayed home, because he and I did the farm work.    Mr. Chevalier: Of course, her father did a lot of the farm work. He used to have a team cultivator, and he would cultivate the crops with a team of horses. He continued farming until he was pretty old.    Ms. Busch: I think we got the tractor in 1950.    Mr. Chevalier: No, we got the tractor in the 1940s. Edmond went in the army, and we got the tractor from him.    Ms. Busch: Before that, I use to cultivate with horses.    Mr. Chevalier: Everything was horses, then. Of course, the thing with animals is that you have to feed them when they're not working, which is from October until it's time to start doing things again. But you have to have enough corn and hay.    Ms. Busch: We had a big corncrib full of corn that we used to feed the horses. And there was so much I forgot.    Ms. Higgins: You remember a lot, too.    Mr. Chevalier: How did you store the corn before you husked it?    Ms. Busch: In the corncrib.    Mr. Chevalier: How did you store it before you had the corncrib? How did you store it when it came from the field?    Ms. Busch: We'd cut the corn stalks, bundle them, and stack them behind the barn.      George and Marie Busch on the farm    Ms. Higgins: Did you and your husband come to live at this farm?    Ms. Busch: Yes. We got married in 1932, and I came home to take care of Mom. Then, my father stayed in the house. We lived in Matawan before that, and my sister Lillian moved into the house in Matawan. She lived in Grantwood, up in North Jersey, before that.     Mr. Chevalier: How did you take care of your mother?    Ms. Busch: In 1937, I came home.    Mr. Chevalier: And how did you do it, what did you do?    Ms. Busch: I cooked, cleaned, and washed everything for her. She used to sit in a chair by that big window over there, and the sun would be shining in. I took care of Mom until 1941.    Ms. Higgins: Did you have children of your own as well?    Ms. Busch: No, I couldn't have children. When I tried to have children and found that I couldn't, they examined George and found out that he had the mumps when he was eighteen years old. But he was a wonderful man. Anything I did was all right.  He used to come down for the weekends before we were married, because he wanted to get out of New York. Otherwise, he would have had to work at his father's delicatessen store in New York on Amsterdam Ave. on the weekends. Pop Busch and Mom Busch had a grocery store on Amsterdam Ave. Well, they sold that and went into another kind of business. Pop said it didn't do so well, so that was when we made that apartment so they would have a place to live here on the farm. My mother-in-law and father-in-law lived in that apartment  they had a bedroom and a kitchen. They stayed there until they died.    Mr. Chevalier: You still had chickens then, still quite a few chickens.    Ms. Busch: Yes. And Pop Busch loved the outside. He used to go out and take care of chickens all the time. But all my other helpers had left. So I've got to do it myself now. But I don't care, I don't have too many chickens.    Ms. Higgins: Do you have chickens now?    Ms. Busch: Yes. Thirty-five.    Ms. Higgins: You care for thirty-five chickens?    Mr. Chevalier: Yes, and a dog.    Ms. Busch: My dog was in the house until Rob found me unconscious on the floor, and then I had to take the dog and lock him up in the chicken yard. Marie just kept going on. She didn't have sense enough to stop, and she conked out and fell on the floor.    Mr. Chevalier: About seven years ago is when you got run over with the tractor. She was under the disk,  her leg was under the disk, and she had seven broken ribs and a broken leg. You were in the hospital for a week.    Ms. Higgins: Which one?    Mr. Chevalier: Bayshore.    Ms. Higgins: You are some tough lady.    Ms. Busch: But I had my set-back.    Mr. Chevalier: About three years ago is when your sugar went crazy and you had a urinary tract infection and pneumonia.    Ms. Busch: I lost weight. I didn't eat. Now I have a big fat stomach and a big fat fanny.    Ms. Higgins: You need to get out cultivating.    Ms. Busch: Yes. And then Rob found me unconscious on the floor. He put me in the hospital. I was in the hospital for three weeks. And then, from there, I went to a nursing home, and the nursing home is a place to go to get back in shape. When they get through with you, you're back in shape, believe me.    Ms. Higgins: How did they get you back in shape?    Ms. Busch: Well, they put you through this therapy. You go up on the platform, and when I first went on it, the nurse was right behind me. You put your hands in front of you and you walk on this platform. After a while, she didn't bother to walk with me. I could do all kinds of things. They have three therapy rooms, and when they get through with you, you're ready to go to sleep. They took me for therapy three times a day.    Ms. Higgins: I think I will go back there and get into shape myself.    Ms. Busch: I was there two days before I got out of bed when I came out of the hospital. In the hospital I got no care at all. The old gang would come sit around the bed. I wouldn't hear a word they were saying. All the family came and I just lay in that bed. The bed was up like this and I was laying on it like it were a board, but I said if I get the nurse to put me in a chair, she wouldn't put you in bed until 10 o'clock at night.    Ms. Higgins: What nursing home did you go to?    Mr. Chevalier: It's now called Madison Center but it was Emory Manor before.    Ms. Busch: It's on the other side of Matawan, when you're going toward South Amboy.    Ms. Higgins: On behalf of myself and this project, I just have to tell you that I've had a wonderful time with you.    Ms. Busch: My life history.    Ms. Higgins: Yes, and it seems to have done you well. And thanks to you, Rob, also.    Ms. Busch: Thank goodness that I can at least still talk. After I came back from the nursing home, I didn't think I was going to last long, but they did a good job on me. I would recommend it to anybody. I think I had a full life, don't you think so?  
MonmouthCounty;Marge Bramley;1919;2000;Marge Bramley, 1919, 2000        Remembering The 20th Century: An Oral History of Monmouth County    Date of Interview: July 26, 2000  Name of Interviewer: Douglas Aumack  Premises of Interview: Ms. Bramley's home, Fair Haven, NJ  Birthdate of Subject: July 24, 1919    Mr. Aumack:  It's a pleasure to be here today.    Ms. Bramley: Thank you.    Mr. Aumack: The first thing I'd like to ask you is, how did you come to Monmouth County and how did your ancestors come to Monmouth County?    Ms. Bramley: I was born in Atlantic Highlands, NJ in 1919. That was my mother's hometown. My mother's family, the Perrines, were Huguenots from the Isle of Jersey. They settled in Monmouth County in the 1600s. My father's family, the MacConnells, were from Glasgow, Scotland, settling in Pennsylvania in the late 1800s.  My father had been from Montclair, New Jersey but was working in Manhattan, and my mother was going into Manhattan to take a course in short hand to be a secretary. She walked into the office of where they had an application for secretaries. My father saw her, and he said she looked like a little Russian princess, and he wanted to meet her desperately. But all the fellows in the office said, "Well, we're never going to introduce you."  He finally burst into the office where she was taking dictation and said, "Oh, you must introduce me to your secretary." That was kind of a cute idea. That's how they met.       Marge Bramley's childhood home, 3rd Avenue and Lincoln in Atlantic Highlands  Mr. Aumack: Describe growing up in Monmouth County.    Ms. Bramley: I remember we lived in Atlantic Highlands on the corner of Lincoln and 3rd. My grandmother lived in a great big old Victorian right across the street, and I was the first child of four. I remember my earliest memories are waking up in my father's arms while he would take me across the street to leave me at my grandmother's house. He and my mother went for a ride in the evening. That was one of the first things I remember. Atlantic Highlands in those days was a beautiful old town. It had a train station, at that time, and my father commuted to New York. He was a New York businessman. Of course sometimes my father took the boat, The Mandalay, that famous boat, between New York and Atlantic Highlands. They now have boating there a lot again. Anyway, I remember my mother would take me by the hand and we'd hide behind the schoolhouse, which was on the way home from the railroad station, and we'd jump out at my father. Those were things I remembered this far back. About two and a half years later my mother gave birth to my first brother, Donald. Eighteen months later my mother gave birth to twins, Douglas and Dorothy. We were a close family as children. We really had a wonderful childhood. We lived there until I was about six years old, and then moved to Red Bank because Red Bank was the "in place." In addition to that the nearby commuting had stopped so my father had to commute from Red Bank.    Mr. Aumack: They tore down the Atlantic Highlands train station?    Ms. Bramley: Yes, they tore down the station.    Mr. Aumack: Do you know why?    Ms. Bramley: I have no idea. But you know at one time, they had a trolley service that went up the line all through the Bayshore Area to Red Bank and that was their one way of getting around. There were no buses, but they had the trolley.    Mr. Aumack: So that was mass transit.    Ms. Bramley: I don't remember that, but I remember when I was a grown up talking about it.    Mr. Aumack: Do you know when that trolley service ended?    Ms. Bramley: No. I don't really remember, but I do know that there was a service. It was not called the trolley service if it came from Red Bank or Fairhaven. They called it the Stagecoach. But I don't believe it really was a stagecoach. I had an older cousin who said that there was a route that came from Red Bank to Fair Haven.    Mr. Aumack: Comment more, please, on why you moved to Red Bank.    Ms. Bramley: I think my mother felt it would be much more fun socially. I'm going to tell you, we moved frequently. In those days my parents did not buy. They never were homeowners. They rented. It was much more the thing to do at that time. Usually if you owned a home it was because you inherited it from a grandparent or a parent. There was a lot of renting done. My mother was an interior decorator by desire, not professionally. So she would fix the house all up in just the way she wanted and then she'd start looking for another house to have more fun to play with. So we did move a lot in the Red Bank area. As a matter of fact, when I was in real estate, we would go out on Open House Day. I'd say, "Oh, I used to live here." I said it so many times that it got to be the joke in the office that I lived everywhere in the Red Bank area.    Mr. Aumack: Now did your mother stop being a secretary?    Ms. Bramley: Oh, yes, as soon as she was married.    Mr. Aumack: Was she paid for her interior decorating services?    Ms. Bramley: No. She just had the skills.    Mr. Aumack: How many houses did she redecorate?    Ms. Bramley: Let me see: we lived on Riverside Avenue. I have a big story about Riverside Avenue. The first one was on Riverside Avenue and then a bigger home on the same block became available but we had to wait between the leases, so we moved into a little house for three months before we moved into the third house. From there we went to Front Street so that's number four. We lived on Front Street where the parking lot for the hospital is now. There were a row of beautiful old homes  two were doctors' homes and one was a small private school. After we left there we moved to Silver White Gardens in Little Silver. Are you keeping track?    Mr. Aumack: Yes.    Ms. Bramley: We were living there when the Depression struck.    Mr. Aumack: So you lived in Silver White Gardens in Little Silver?    Ms. Bramley: Yes. That house is still there. Now after that we lived on Bergen Place in Red Bank. From there we moved to South Orange because my mother and her sister were able to save enough money together to open a Tea Room on South Orange Avenue in South Orange. It was a very big home right on the main drive. There were living quarters for all of us upstairs, and the Tea Room was downstairs. That lasted for about two years, and then we returned to Little Silver. We lived on Prospect Avenue, and from there we moved to Monroe Avenue in Little Silver.    Mr. Aumack: How long did you stay on Prospect?    Ms. Bramley: Probably only as long as my father could pay the rent. It was a very bad time. He had been an executive with the Travelers Insurance Company so we were not struck by the Depression immediately, but then things happened where they got rid of all the executives. But they did offer him the opportunity to move to Hartford where the headquarters were. But my mother foolishly said, "Oh, I don't want to leave this part of the world where I've always been." From then on he never had real, true employment. So we  came home and we lived on Prospect Avenue in Little Silver. Then he had this brilliant idea that maybe if we could live on a little farm we could support ourselves as far as food goes. Big mistake.    Mr. Aumack: Where was this farm?    Ms. Bramley: It's where the Monmouth Mall is now.    Mr. Aumack: You lived on a farm that is now Monmouth Mall?    Ms. Bramley: Yes. Actually, we lived across the street from it.     Mr. Aumack: What year did your father buy the farm?    Ms. Bramley: He didn't buy it.    Mr. Aumack: Oh, he rented the farm.    Ms. Bramley: Yes, for thirty dollars a month. You know what we had? This little tiny house with three bedrooms and the bathroom was downstairs which was very inconvenient. The heating was so poor that we were never able to handle the furnace. The furnace was always going out. It was a very cold bathroom sometimes. But any rate, it was to be a great success, as we were going to farm. The first summer we were there, we had a lovely asparagus patch. We planted different vegetables but they all died because we didn't know how to take care of them. But it was fun that first summer because there were barns and we made bedrooms in the barns. Three kids slept up there, which was kind of fun until a bat came in one night. I never slept there again. The one success we had was raising chickens. We bought a bunch of them and they seemed to survive and of course they were to be eaten. That was the object of having them. Finally the time came, we had a couple of great big old roosters and Dad said, "Well this particular one," of course, we named them all. We had one named Adam and he was the one that was chosen to be the first victim. The other one was called Mr. Garrison because he looked so much like a friend of my father's. Mr. Garrison never made the table but Adam did. My father said to my older brother, "There's a hatchet down in the barn. You get it and just grab him and it's over in a few minutes and it's good experience for you." My brother said, "Well I am going to leave home first rather than do this to Adam." The rooster was our friend. My father was disgusted, but he wouldn't do it either, so we got a local farmer to do it and of course nobody would eat the chicken. The kids wouldn't. Because it had been our friend.    Mr. Aumack: So it was like the family pet.     Ms. Bramley: So that was our experiences on the farm. We were not born farmers. But at that time, my father did pass away, and we were left there, and the boys were drafted in the Army. First my older brother and then my younger brother in two years. My mother, my sister and I, in the meantime, were employed. My sister and I both worked at AT&T in New York at 195 Broadway as messenger girls. We made fifteen dollars a week and we paid three dollars and fifty cents a week for commuting to the city. We were just surviving. One day my sister took a day off and went over to Fort Monmouth because she had heard they were starting to hire people.  When I came home, she said, "Maggie you're never going to believe it. Guess what? I got a job as a typist, and they're paying me forty-five dollars a week! From fifteen!" Guess what? I took the next day off and did the same thing.    Mr. Aumack: Did you get a job?    Ms. Bramley: Oh you bet. And my mother got a job over there too. All three of us. So that's what we did during the war. My one brother, Donald, was with Patton in the 3rd Armored Division..    Mr. Aumack: How long was he with Patton?    Ms. Bramley: In April 1945 he was wounded seriously  that was the year that the war ended. So he was in the war four years.    Mr. Aumack: Was he drafted?    Ms. Bramley: They were both drafted. He crossed into Germany, and this was right before the end of the war. His tank was hit by a civilian who was in the church tower with a bazooka. As a result of that he lost his leg. Incidentally, he was extremely tall. He was six feet six inches. They had to make the longest artificial leg they ever had.    Mr. Aumack: Goodness. They had to amputate?    Ms. Bramley: Oh yes, he lost his leg, and he almost lost one of his arms. He was in Walter Reed Hospital for a year recovering because they thought he was going to lose his arm. Thank goodness he didn't. My other brother, Douglas, was out in the South Pacific. Actually he had been stationed in Australia and then was sent to New Guinea. He was there, not in a combat situation. The Red Cross came around and interviewed Donald at Walter Reed, and he was saying that he had a brother in the South Pacific. I think my mother was there, and she said, "Please get him home immediately," and they did. General McArthur actually signed the paper and released him to come home because we were down to the last surviving member of the family. They were very good about that.     Mr. Aumack: What was your official job at Fort Monmouth?    Ms. Bramley: I was a clerk typist. Believe it or not, my job originally was distributing coal to all of the GI's who were stationed around here. I guess almost everybody used to heat with coal, and the army, of course, had an unlimited supply, although most people had to really struggle to get it.    Mr. Aumack: What was your mother's job?    Ms. Bramley: I'm not quite sure. She was a secretary in one of the offices. As for my sister, my sister had a wonderful job. She was in headquarters and she was head of the whole filing department of all of the people who came. We even eventually had Russian soldiers there too. It was interesting to see them walking around the post.    Mr. Aumack: Why?    Ms. Bramley: Well, because they had been our enemies and now they were suddenly on our side. This was later on in the war. We also had a great number of Italian prisoners. They were all billeted at Fort Monmouth, and it was so much fun. Nobody ever took Italians as being serious bad guys. Nobody could feel that way about an Italian.    Mr. Aumack: Really?    Ms. Bramley: Yes. You know they had a bad leader. Mussolini was a jackass and got them into the war. I don't think their hearts were ever in the war at all. So they were out of it quickly, you know. First of all, we had captured tons of them. They probably said, "Take me, here I am." They were brought to this country. A lot of them were kept at Fort Monmouth. They had a whole section where all the Italian prisoners were kept. They worked on the yards and stuff, you know, lawn work, and jobs like that. But on a Sunday the whole place was surrounded by Italian-Americans.  The Italians were all billeted on Oceanport Avenue, and they had a big wire fence that ran all around it. The Italian-Americans would come every Sunday. Tons of people from Long Branch, which has always been an Italian settlement, would come, because they knew some of these families. You would see a long line of them  they would bring food and treats. They all knew how to speak Italian. At first, it was like, "Ah, they're out there with the enemy," and then you'd think, "Oh, well they're Italians, they are not really our enemies." It was quite interesting to see how they were soon accepted, and I'm sure some of them married local girls.     Mr. Aumack: Do you know how many prisoners of war were there?    Ms. Bramley: I would say maybe a couple of hundred.    Mr. Aumack: Did you ever talk to them?    Ms. Bramley: No, I never did that.     Mr. Aumack: You witnessed a fairly reasonable treatment of Italian prisoners of war.    Ms. Bramley: Really, in some ways, it was a wonderful time. We were really young, and it was, in a way, a marvelous time of our lives what was going on in the war, and thankfully our brothers survived. That was the most important thing, and of course in the meantime, I had a beau who was in the war. He was in the Air Force. I eventually married him. That was my first husband, William Evans. I had my oldest son, David, by him.    Mr. Aumack: How did you meet him?    Ms. Bramley: We had all gone to school together around here. He was older, of course, than I was. I had an admirer who still is one of my dearest friends. He always said that he would've married me except I was too tall. He's not very tall. Bill Evans said to this admirer that he'd seen me down town someplace, and he wanted to meet me. So we dated, but not an awful lot. This is funny: the first night he brought me home, he said, "What are you doing this weekend and the week after and the rest of your life?" I said, "Who is this fresh cat?    Mr. Aumack: After how many dates?    Ms. Bramley: One date.    Mr. Aumack: After one date he was proposing.    Ms. Bramley: Well, he was sort of.    Mr. Aumack: But it wasn't serious?    Ms. Bramley: No. Then we started to date every once in a while. He immediately was drafted. He was one of the first low numbers or whatever they were called. He was stationed down in South, so when he had leave, he'd send me a telegram saying, "I'm coming, please be free." Because, you know, we were young and cute and we dated a lot. My sister was a real beauty. That part of the war was fun. Fort Monmouth was loaded with all these young men. It was wonderful, because they were all being trained to be officers. So they were special.    Mr. Aumack: So they had an officer training camp?    Ms. Bramley: Oh yes. It was a signal school that they were being taught in.    Mr. Aumack: Tell us about Mr. Evans' service.    Ms. Bramley: He was a Bombardier on a B26. They were hit once, because he had a Purple Heart, but he would never talk about it because of the fact that my one brother was so badly wounded. He thought that his wound was so insignificant  it didn't even hospitalize him. I think he was hit by shrapnel.    Mr. Aumack: He felt a little insecure because your brother had lost his entire leg.    Ms. Bramley: Well actually, near the end of the war, my brother was in Germany where he was hit. They amputated his leg immediately on the field, but then they sent him to Paris to be in a hospital. Somehow or other through this wonderful mail system we had at that time, I was able to tell Bill Evans that my brother had been injured and in Paris. At that time, Bill was right near there, and because the war had ended, they were all free. So he tried to get into the hospital to see Donald, but just missed him. Oh, that's a story in its self about what happened to my brother. He was injured, and what they did at that time because there were so many injuries, they didn't leave them in Europe. They brought him home immediately. We had gotten a telegram that my brother had been seriously injured. My mother and sister and I got Sundays off because everybody worked on Saturdays in those days, and we went driving up there. We had already called my uncle and aunt in Freehold to say that we were coming up and that Donald had been so hurt. We clung together as a family you know. As we drove in the drive that night, my uncle ran out of the house and said, "Don is on the phone." I don't know if I can keep from crying because it was a very moving experience. We said, "What do you mean he's on the phone?" "He's in New York on Long Island. They shuttled those kids over, and he's only going to be there twenty-four hours, and then they were going to send him to Walter Reed Hospital." They had a big amputee section in Walter Reed Hospital.    Mr. Aumack: Where is Walter Reed Hospital?    Ms. Bramley: Washington DC. We had no gasoline in those days. It was so limited. So my uncle said, "We're going to go out there." So we went to Santini Air Base. I had never heard of it in my life before, or since. Actually, I don't think it was anything more than a little private airfield, but they were bringing in these big planes loaded with the wounded. So that was one of the most outstanding days of my life to see what we saw that day. They were just unloading these planes with guys on stretchers, you know, but they were also cheerful  they came yelling. When they saw Dotty and me they yelled, "American girls!" That was very moving, but then we went in and saw they had these kids in bed. They were just right on top of each other there was so many, but they were getting them out of there as fast as they could. So we saw my brother. He said, "Mom, don't even think about my leg." The fact that he lived through what he lived through and was home, you know, that was a big thing because the tank had been struck. He was a gunner in it and he was hardly able to get out of it because it hit his elbow and leg both. He always swore he heard my father say, "Get out of this." He said, "Don't worry, I'm so thrilled I'm home. What we were going through, I didn't think we were going to make it." It was such a horrendous battle  it was the Germans' last stand.    Mr. Aumack: Was that the Battle of the Bulge?    Ms. Bramley: He was in the Colmar Pocket. I think it's in France, but I'm not sure. He was across the line when he was hit. He was in Germany. They were chasing the Germans.    Mr. Aumack: Did any of Donald's comrades in that tank die?    Ms. Bramley: Yes. I think there were just two of them who lived.    Mr. Aumack: Out of how many?    Ms. Bramley: I don't know how many. They had big reunions every once in a while, but Donald did not go to them. He did fine as a young man with an artificial leg. But being so tall, he got to the point where his other leg gave away. So he was in a wheelchair for the last twenty years of his life and he just passed away three years ago. His wife and I, my sister-in-law, are very close friends.    Mr. Aumack: Let's go back a bit. How long did your father rent that farm on Wyckoff Road?    Ms. Bramley: Maybe three years. Incidentally it was thirty dollars a month rent.    Mr. Aumack: Why did you leave?    Ms. Bramley: Because our father had died, and both the boys had been drafted by that time. So we three women were most fortunate to find a housing development that had been put up during the war for employees of the army. It was called Vail Homes. It is still there, if you know where it is.    Mr. Aumack: Where is that?    Ms. Bramley: It's in Eatontown. Well, it was called Eatontown then. It's off of Shrewsbury Ave. after you cross Sycamore Avenue. It's to the right just before you get out to Route 35. They were brand new, and we were able to get to live in one of those. They were small, and they were adorable. It was our lifesaver, because we didn't need anything more than that, and it was very cheap if you worked for the government, which we did.    Mr. Aumack: Do you remember how much it cost?    Ms. Bramley: I think it was thirty-five dollars a month.    Mr. Aumack: That's only little bit more than the farm was.    Ms. Bramley: Well, by this time, all three of us had these great jobs at forty-five dollars a week. We were rich.    Mr. Aumack: When did your father die?    Ms. Bramley: He died when we were still living on the farm in the beginning of the war. He had a heart attack and died.    Mr. Aumack: What was your father's official job in New York?    Ms. Bramley: He was an executive in the Travelers Insurance Company.    Mr. Aumack: Was that a lucrative job before the crash?    Ms. Bramley: Oh yes. We were considered rich. We always had a maid, and when the twins were born we needed more help. There was a German family in Atlantic Highlands. He was a baker in town, and he brought his younger sister from Germany after World War I. She was probably only a teenager then, but she lived with us for years. We always called her "Frauleine" because she took care of the twins. When they were little, they could speak German, as a result of her. She was a nursemaid. So we had a nursemaid and we always had a maid, and besides that, we had a lady who came in and ironed. They were very plush times, like it is now. See it wasn't just us. The Depression just knocked it all.    Mr. Aumack: You had a story about Riverside. Did you live there, too?    Ms. Bramley: Yes. Riverside Avenue. We lived on Riverside Avenue, which is now really like a highway, and this was before Coopers Bridge was built. You know the great big one, the original one.    Mr. Aumack: The one right near Oyster Point.    Ms. Bramley: Yes. We did not have any bridge there when we were children.  Are you familiar with Riverside Avenue? There was no bridge there then. It was just a beautiful street because the homes on the river were gorgeous from the Oyster Point all the way to Maple Avenue. The houses on the river were great beautiful homes. And the most beautiful was where the Molly Pitcher is now. It was owned by a man named Burton Downing. He had two little girls. I played with them. Their home was so delicious. I used to love to go there, because it was on the river. They had the most gorgeous piece of property. Across the street and where Day's funeral home is now was their carriage house . They didn't have carriages, I'm not that old! Two beautiful cars were inside there, and above it was the maid's quarters, I can remember the name  it was a couple, Ellie and Ben. She was the maid in the house. I played over there all the time. It had a big wrap around front porch over the river. It really was a gorgeous spot. They eventually moved it across the street to where Dave's is now, and it became a funeral home, that beautiful old home, and then it burned down.    Mr. Aumack: When was that fire?    Ms. Bramley: It was a long time ago now. I guess probably sometime in the 1960s.    Mr. Aumack: When did Molly Pitcher go up?    Ms. Bramley:  I think it was in 1927. I only think of that because on the corner stone they have 1927. But then there were other gorgeous homes along there, and we lived on the other side of the street. Our old home is still there on Allen Place. There was a bank at the end of Allen Place at one time.  That was our first move into Red Bank. There were other beautiful homes on the river but they started to go to the dogs. Riverside Avenue did, too. They sold one of the big houses right across the street from where we were  they lifted it up off the cellar and put it on big timbers to roll it down to the river. They were going to put it on a raft and locate it someplace on the river. It didn't happen. One day when I came home for lunch from school at lunch time, we heard this god awful noise. It was a big explosion, and we ran up the street and saw a big column of dust and sand going up in the air. At the bottom of the hill was all lumber. That had been the house.    Mr. Aumack: Did it collapse?    Ms. Bramley: It collapsed, it got away, and it rolled down to the river. There's not very many people who know that story about that house. I was a very close friend with an ancient schoolteacher of mine, and she was the only one besides me to remember. Even my own mother said, "I don't remember that happening." It did happen, nonetheless. They built an apartment house there, which is now Twin Gables Apartments. They closed that. Then the next thing they did was to sell the other house near it to the Knights of Columbus. This is a personal story, part of this. We kids loved it, because once a year they had a big festival on the grounds there. They'd get a merry-go-round, they had booths with spinning wheels, and there was a lot of music for about a week, you know. Oh, we kids loved that. My family didn't think too much of it because it sort of made the neighborhood a little too commercial. I've got to tell you this funny story. One of my father's best friends was a man named Frank Byrne, and he was the father of Brendon Byrne, who eventually became the governor of New Jersey not too many years ago. He was more fun, this man, when he came to visit us, because he was the biggest tease in the world. He knew how to be a ventriloquist. I remember he would do the darndest things. When he came to visit us, a clock that never struck an hour would start to go "bong, bong." We kids were suspicious. If you'd tip over our dolls they'd all say, "Momma" or cry. We knew it was him, but we never could catch him. He could do it so well. He was a member of the Knights of Columbus. So he came down to visit, to go to one of the affairs and he stayed with us. My grandmother did not approve, you know, people were so bigoted in those days. Anything that was Irish was bad.    Mr. Aumack: Really, why?    Ms. Bramley: Because they were Catholics.    Mr. Aumack: Oh, and you were?    Ms. Bramley: We were Protestants! Of course, they always referred to Black people as "darkees." You don't need to put that in, that's pretty bad. Well, it was the times. But anyway, my grandmother did not like this idea of this thing going on across the street, but she'd sit on the front porch and watch what was going on. She had very bad ideas about what was going on over there because of "the wild Irish." Frank had gone over there for the evening, and he saw her sitting out on the front porch. So he put on this big drunken act. He was so bad. He stumbled, he ran into a tree, he came to the steps, and he would go up three, and go down two. She ran upstairs and locked herself in the bedroom and she never ever believed that that was just a joke. She would say, "Oh, no, he was drunk." I can't think of anything else about Riverside Avenue except we loved it, it was beautiful. Actually we were on Allen Place. There was a farmhouse sitting on the river. It was beautiful, and the Allen family owned it. That's where the street name came from. It had a beautiful grass tennis court on the river on the other side of the street.     Mr. Aumack: You mentioned other homes on Riverside Ave.    Ms. Bramley:  I've one more to tell you about. Going up that street they were all riverside homes. They were beautiful homes, but further up, away from the one that fell down, was a lovely old house that sat way back. I remember it had a big curving driveway. It was owned by a very elegant pair of lady sisters who were in the candy business. Have you ever heard about any of this?    Mr. Aumack: No.    Ms. Bramley: It was called the Madaleine Candy Company. These ladies made wonderful chocolate candies. They were really well known because they had a very distinctive box that they put the candy in. It was sort of like white satin paper and in big gold puff letters it had "Madaleine." As children, you know if you ever saw one of these, you were hoping somebody was going to give you a treat.    Mr. Aumack: Were they all chocolate?    Ms. Bramley: Yes  they were filled with things like creams and caramels and stuff like that. I remember that they must have made a living by it. Somebody in my office remembered the story about them, too  one of the gentleman there. Every once in a while, they would make some kind of nugget or something that would take a lot of egg whites. They'd come across the street and they'd have a big bowl of just yolks and they'd say, "Does anybody want to make a pound cake or something? We've got all these egg yolks to give away."    Mr. Aumack: Did people flock to it?    Ms. Bramley: Well you know she just went to friends  to my mother and another family right behind us, the Ross family, and that's another whole story, but anyway. They were very good friends. We benefited by it, so did Mrs. Ross.    Mr. Aumack: Were the candy company ladies considered outlandish?    Ms. Bramley: No, they were very elegant. It's interesting that women who were in that business lived in such a beautiful home. Maybe they needed the money or maybe they were just talented in making this particular kinds of chocolates. They were very well known.    Mr. Aumack: Were they discriminated against sometimes because they were women?    Ms. Bramley: No.    Mr. Aumack: Were they affordable candies?    Ms. Bramley: I think they were expensive. I would guess that they were.    Mr. Aumack: Where did they distribute their candy?    Ms. Bramley: They evidently advertised, because people knew about them. I think they were quite well known, and not only locally.    Mr. Aumack: Did they sell their candy to places in New York?    Ms. Bramley: I wouldn't have known. I was a child.    Mr. Aumack: We were talking about Riverside Avenue and all the houses. Now these houses were literally on the side of the river.    Ms. Bramley: Most, yes. We did not live on that side. The two homes we lived in on that street were not on the riverside.    Mr. Aumack: But you were across the street from Riverside Avenue. Why did they take some of those homes down?    Ms. Bramley: It started to get commercial. As I say, first of all, the apartment house, The Twin Gables, went up there. A doctor lived in one of them. But I think probably, the onslaught of the Molly Pitcher Hotel is what really changed the street, completely, because then it became commercial. Also having that bridge open, because suddenly you had this great outpouring of traffic from New York City, and from all of Northern New Jersey. Before that it had been just a little sleepy street.      New Cooper's Bridge between Red Bank and Middletown,   May 22, 1926  Mr. Aumack: When did the Cooper Bridge go up? Do you know?    Ms. Bramley: I have a picture of my grandmother and my brother standing on the bridge the day that it was opened, believe it or not.    Mr. Aumack: Do you know what year that was?    Ms. Bramley: I keep thinking 1927. I don't know whether that's true or not. But it appeared, at that time, in a famous newspaper called the Herald Tribune and every Sunday they had a photogravure section. Do you know what that is?    Mr. Aumack: No.    Ms. Bramley: I bet you don't. It was a picture section. The pictures were brown and everything was brown and white. It was just a part of the Herald Tribune and it had a picture of my grandmother. I can show it to you if you want me to. I don't know if there's any point.    Mr. Aumack: Sure.    Ms. Bramley: It is sort of old and ratty looking now, but it's in our book. Some kind of historical book was printed not long ago, and they actually showed that picture. It didn't say who the woman was  she was about this big in it. She was my grandmother. I'll take it out so you can see it. These family albums are about to fall apart.    Mr. Aumack: All right, we were talking about the Cooper Bridge and we were also talking about the Molly Pitcher Inn. When did the Molly Pitcher Inn go up? What is the history of that property?    Ms. Bramley: I never knew anything about it except I was enamored as a child of the parents of the house, because the inside of the home was always my idea of a dream home, it was so beautiful. On the third floor there was a huge room and it was just called "the nursery" and it had drawers into the walls filled with Halloween costumes and blocks and all kinds of things that kids love. It was meant for the children. There were only two children in the family. It had windows looking down at the river. That was the most glorious part of that whole home. It was just wicked that it was ever destroyed or moved, but of course, the Molly Pitcher is a great thing, too. I just always had felt very sad about Riverside Avenue because it was such a glorious street at one time, with beautiful homes. It's just a commercial fly by now.    Mr. Aumack: So you think that the community of Red Bank changed because of the direction of Molly Pitcher and the Cooper Bridge?    Ms. Bramley: Yes, I think they changed that part of town. I must tell you another love story I have for a certain part Red Bank and that's the Carlton Theater, which is now the Count Basie Theater. I think that was built soon before we moved into town. That's where every child spent Saturday afternoon watching the movies.    Mr. Aumack: Watching what movies?    Ms. Bramley: Well, there were serials and of course there was always a cowboy picture. I have to tell you this one story. When you went in, it was always cold and dark and beautiful inside and from the ceiling hung a great crystal globe, which gave off an enormous glow. While you were waiting for the show to start it would rotate  it had lights playing on it, and they'd play music. This was all boring to the kids. We were waiting to see a serial called "Mark of the Frog." It was frightening, I remember that. It was some stupid thing about somebody wearing what they used to call an aviation helmet. It had big goggles, probably from World War I. Well, anyway we went every Saturday. A matter of fact, one time all four of us had the chicken pox at the same time. So we were home from school, all four of us, and my mother didn't know what to do with us. So she took us and put us in the theater by ourselves and we spent most of our chicken pox time down at the theater. On my twelfth birthday, I had a new outfit, and here I am, the oldest of the kids, and we go down there. When I put out my dime, the girl said, "How old are you?" and happily says I, "Twelve years old today." "Well you need a quarter if you're twelve years old." So I started to cry, and she said, "Go home and get the rest of the money from your father," which I did. At that time the manager was a dear man called Tony Hunting who had been in vaudeville. Oh gosh they were the most wonderful family. It was Tony and Corinne Hunting and they had their own act in vaudeville.    Mr. Aumack: In New York City?    Ms. Bramley: Yes, well they traveled all over the country. Here, in Fair Haven, this whole area had vaudevillians who summered here during the off season.    Mr. Aumack: The same, yes. Would you like to comment on that?    Ms. Bramley: My father scolded Tony about the quarter. Tony said, "I didn't know anything about it. Of course I would let the kid in." Many years later, Tony and Corinne opened up a kindergarten in their home. It was like a play school, actually for pre-kindergarten children. God, it was so much fun because my oldest boy went there a couple of times, and she'd be sitting playing the piano and he would tap dance for us on the way to the door, as we would bring the kids in. So adorable. They were so great.    Mr. Aumack: We have to get to your real estate. We were talking about Corinne and Tony Hunting Vaudevillians who were entertaining kids by tap-dancing. You didn't go to his school though?    Ms. Bramley: No, No.    Mr. Aumack: Tell me more about the "Mark of the Frog," and the movie at Carlton Theater.    Ms. Bramley: They were always cowboys. For years I used to love Ken Maynard. I'm sure you never heard of them or Hoot Gibson. Those were the two cowboy stars of that era.    Mr. Aumack: About how long were the movies?    Ms. Bramley: I guess like a full-length feature today, but they always had the news first. There was a certain routine that you went through: news and then something light.    Mr. Aumack: Like what?    Ms. Bramley: A short comedy thing.    Mr. Aumack: Was it a cartoon or was it a Three Stooges kind of thing?    Ms. Bramley: I don't remember many cartoons when we were little. I remember the early Mickey Mouse. The big thing was the serials. They would always end with something dreadful about to happen, and then next week you'd go, and find that by some miracle, they'd survived.    Mr. Aumack: Did you ever see Tom Mix and his cowboys?    Ms. Bramley: Oh, yes, I used to see Tom Mix.    Mr. Aumack: Was he one of your favorites?    Ms. Bramley: Oh yes, but Ken Maynard was better looking. He had a horse, a big white horse named Tarzan.    Mr. Aumack: Of course everyone would know that. Where did you go to grammar school and high school?    Ms. Bramley: Another interesting thing that's a tragedy to me is the parking lot at the hospital that's on Front Street. The hospital's on the river, and then there's that big parking lot that's across that little friendly street.  Well, of that whole strip, there's only one house left.  That was a row of beautiful old homes, too. We lived in one of those homes. Right behind our house was a great big old white house which became Riverview Hospital. It was an old white house on the river  and there were other homes along there, too. There's a very old Victorian still there. An eye doctor has it. That's the last of those buildings. Two houses from us was a dear old home. It was so old that the basement was all brick and it had brick ovens in it. That was torn down for a parking lot. It was formerly the school called Burton Hall, and it was run by Georgie Hazard. Georgie Hazard ran that school all by herself. She had from kindergarten to high school. There'd be no more than four or five students in each class, and I was there as a kindergarten child. I think I stayed there until I learned how to read, so it must have been the first grade. She had her mother, who was a little round fat lady. I can see her now. You went to a special room where she taught you multiplication tables and spelling. I can see her sitting there now. Georgie Hazard was quite a wonderful person. She had been married to a Hazard of the Hazards who owned the famous Hazard Tomato Factory on Sycamore Ave. Have you ever heard of that?     Mr. Aumack: No.    Ms. Bramley: Oh that was quite long ago. It was before my time. All I know is that she had married into that family which was quite well to do. She evidently was divorced, or at least she never had a husband that I ever saw. She taught all of us there. The decorum was marvelous. Nobody spoke out of turn. That house of hers was so darling. There were two rooms in the front of the house  they were bigger, but each one of them had a fireplace, and all winter long when we went there she had a metal basket in there, and it burned cannel coal. Have you ever heard of that?    Mr. Aumack: No.    Ms. Bramley: You have big chunks of coal like this and they burn just like coal does, but slowly. They get real hot and after they split open, there'd be oil in it, so flames would shoot up. It was so picturesque: two lovely rooms with these fireplaces going on a cold winter's day. The other room across from these two rooms was the music room where she had a beautiful piano and piano lessons were given there, too. When that house was torn down, I could've cried, because I remember how beautiful it was, and with this old brick basement. You stepped down to big dining room in the back of the house, and if you were naughty and spoke out of turn, you had to go sit at the dining room table. I remember when it happened to me. Horrified. When that house was torn down, my husband and I went there. I was in tears that they were tearing down this gorgeous old home, but we resurrected one thing.     Mr. Aumack: Was this school a grammar school?    Ms. Bramley: No. I went there for a couple years, but eventually I went to the Oakland Street School, which is now that big restaurant. I went there through the third grade, and then I went back to Mrs. Hazard's for a year, and then I went into the public school system in Red Bank. It was great, and I went there until I graduated. That's the old school of course.    Mr. Aumack: So you graduated from Red Bank Regional?    Ms. Bramley: No. It was called Red Bank High School.    Mr. Aumack: Thee high school and that's what is now called the middle school?    Ms. Bramley: Yes.    Mr. Aumack: What year did you graduate from high school?    Ms. Bramley: 1938. That school is still there, but not the old place that they tore down with the elementary part of it.    Mr. Aumack: What did you do after the war?    Ms. Bramley: That's not very interesting, but after the war I married my Bill Evans. He didn't want to get married until he made sure he came home. We lived in Fair Haven on the river on Gillespie Ave. It was a wonderful, wonderful time in our lives because both of my brothers were back home. When we left that government development, my mother said that she wanted to have a big home for the boys to come home to. My one brother was coming home, and the other was convalescing in the hospital for a year . So here were we three women making a fortune by this time, we were probably making sixty dollars a week. So Mom came down here and found a house on Gillespie Avenue on the river. It was a great big old house for one hundred and fifty dollars a month rent. This is big stuff now.    Mr. Aumack: Was that called cheap?    Ms. Bramley: No, that was big money for us. My mother figured it out. If each of the three of us contributed a certain amount of money, and included a women who was working with Mother over at Fort Monmouth who had three dogs, it would come out just right. That woman was having the worst time trying to find a place to rent because of the dogs. This house came with a dog kennel in the yard  it was perfect. So we said, "Do you want to come and chip in?" So the four of us were able to afford this big house. We had so much fun when the war was over because my one brother was immediately free to come home.  My husband-to-be and I were engaged, and my brother was back and forth everyday to Fort Dix waiting to be ushered out of the army.    Mr. Aumack: Is this Douglas or Donald?    Ms. Bramley: Douglas. Donald was still in the hospital. Then he started coming home on weekends. When he came home those weekends, there was still a gas shortage, but we always had friends to say, "Come on, I've got gas. We'll go get him and bring him home," you know. We were all big card players, and we had this big, big round table, and we played cards night and day. I think it was mostly Rummy games. Then all the boys who had been in the army with my brothers, and old mates from school or college came around and visited. They all sort of did this. So we always had these wonderful kids visiting, and we had a third floor with extra bedrooms. It was a marvelous time.    Mr. Aumack: It was like a little hotel?    Ms. Bramley: Yes, it was.    Mr. Aumack: But you didn't charge anyone.    Ms. Bramley: No.    Mr. Aumack: They were all friends.    Ms. Bramley: I had married in the meantime and my younger brother, Doug, married. Then I got pregnant and had a baby, and there was still all this gaiety. We were right on the river, and we could be seen playing cards all night on a hot night, and the boys would run out in their shorts, take a swim in the river, and come back and play cards. It was so much fun. I always remembered the Frank Sinatra records. It was that time that he started to get popular. We had my baby in the carriage, and somebody would be walking it while we were playing cards, or rocking the carriage. We stayed there until everybody started getting married off. Then we moved up the street to a compound of three houses. My younger brother Doug married the daughter of the big house. My Bill and I bought the middle house, and then my brother Don bought the little tiny house, so we were all one family on the drive, which again was wonderful. My brother Don's family outgrew that house quickly, and then my sister bought the house from him. So we were still all there together. Then the bad things started happening. A short time after we were married, maybe after David was born, my husband started feeling poorly.    Mr. Aumack: Was David your first child?    Ms. Bramley: Yes.    Mr. Aumack: What year did you marry Bill Evans?    Ms. Bramley: In 1945. He had gotten a wonderful job. They were looking for people every place, and he worked for Exxon. He had a great job with them. But he was not well. For almost a year we didn't know what was the matter  we kept thinking maybe he had an ulcer. But through an examination with chest x-rays that was done throughout the Exxon company, he found out he had tuberculosis. They immediately assigned him to a sanatorium, and Exxon took over. They were wonderful. They paid for everything, continued his salary, and took care of us. He was in the hospital for two years. When he got out, he was still not well, and he eventually died at only thirty-three years old. I had my baby anyway and then I… oh God, I don't want to tell you everything, because there's so many things happened in my life. When we were in the big house, and I had the baby, my mother remarried. She married the father of a fellow that my sister had been engaged to who had been killed in the war. We loved him dearly  he was our stepfather. He was just a darling. We all lived together down on the driveway in my house. We lived there until I met my second husband, Bob Bramley. In the meantime, I had a big career in the city. I went back to school so I could be a secretary.    Mr. Aumack: You went to secretarial school?    Ms. Bramley: Yes. I got a job with Boy's Life Magazine. It was a wonderful job. We were in the advertising part of it. From there I went on and worked at Time Life Magazine.    Mr. Aumack: What was your job?    Ms. Bramley: I was the secretary to the department head of the advertising department. My boss had a certain number of accounts and we serviced them. I really had a good job. In the meantime, thankfully, my mother and father were living with me, taking care of my child, because I wasn't home all day. When I changed from Boys Life to Life Magazine, I had to stay in New York late one night to be interviewed to get the job, and on the way home on the train I met an old friend who I hadn't seen in years. He said, "You're still not married. What's the matter with you?" About a week later he called me up. He said, "I've got somebody I want you to meet." So he brought over Bob Bramley, who had just been divorced, and who had two children. I thought he was kind of cute, but he had the damnedest outfit on. He had gone to New York, and he had a lot of ladies interested in him.  They took him to the Irish Shoppe and bought him an Irish overcoat that almost went to his ankles. He was the darnest looking sight I ever saw    Mr. Aumack: What is an Irish overcoat?    Ms. Bramley: Well, it is very tweedy, very tweedy. He paid a fortune for it, I know, but he looked lost in it.    Mr. Aumack: They thought he looked really good. How did he really look in your opinion?    Ms. Bramley: Well, he looked funny. They picked me up and we went to somebody's house, and I thought he was kind of cute.  But I never thought another thing about him. I was having a dinner party, and the person I was really dating at that time couldn't make it. So my mother said, "Well, why don't you asked that Bob Bramley? He seemed nice." I said, "You mean the one with the overcoat?" So I called, and he said, "Ah, I would love to be able to come, but darn it, a friend called and asked my daughter and me for dinner that night." I said, "Ah, that's all right." The next day, he called me. He said, "The most wonderful thing has happened. My daughter's come down with chicken pox, and we can't go. I'll come to your party." He looked much cuter that time.    Mr. Aumack: Oh that's good.    Ms. Bramley: It was the fastest courtship you've ever seen in your life. We met in February and were married in June. I had a wonderful life with him too, God bless him. We had a grand time.    Mr. Aumack: February of what year?    Ms. Bramley: 1951.     Mr. Aumack: Now how long were you married to your cutie pie?    Ms. Bramley: He was a cutie pie. He died thirteen years ago. We never made our twenty-fifth anniversary. He came down with cancer. He had been a big, big smoker. Smoking kills you. But he was a kid, you know. We both gave it up when Douglas, who was in school, came home, hiding my cigarettes, throwing them away. "Mom, I don't want you to die from smoking," he said. Everybody in school was told that to get their parents away from smoking, and we finally did give it up.    Mr. Aumack: That's good.    Ms. Bramley: Yes, but unfortunately it was not in time for Bob. He became one of the editors for The Red Bank Register. Writing was his true love. I have things that he wrote that really should all be put in a book sometime, especially his stories of World War II, because he, too, was in the war.    Mr. Aumack: What did he do?    Ms. Bramley: He was in the infantry. He was an officer and a Major when he finally got out.    Mr. Aumack: Who was he under? Who did he serve with?    Ms. Bramley: I don't remember if it was anyone particular but he lived in Germany for maybe six months after the war was over, and loved it. We eventually went back there. It was a wonderful trip. We went back and drove across France into Germany, because  at that time I had a niece who was stationed there with her husband. So we went to a little town where he had been billeted for a time after Germany had fallen. The officers actually lived in someone's home. He found that house as we rode around and rode around and he got such a thrill out of that. There was a woman working in the back yard. Bob could speak German, and he approached her, and discovered she'd been the little girl when he had lived in the house, so they had a great reunion.    Mr. Aumack: Mr. Bramley talked about the war or wrote about it. Was there anything that changed his life?     Ms. Bramley: No. But he always had bad knees right after that, because the last winter of the war was extremely cold in Germany. It was wicked. They were spending a lot of time in the trenches. They would dig in, he said. He slept overnight a couple of times in those trenches, and almost froze to pieces. He always said he had arthritis from that. I have reams of stories about what he did during the war because he wrote for the paper. That was the best experience of his life, or the most exciting experience in his life: the war.    Mr. Aumack: How many children did you have? You had David from Mr. Evans.    Ms. Bramley: And then I had Douglas with Bob Bramley, and then we adopted another son, Duff.    Mr. Aumack: What changes have you seen in Monmouth County for better or for worse?    Ms. Bramley: I have really lived around here a lot. I still have a great love for all of it. I know Red Bank has changed terrifically, but I'm glad because, my God, about ten years ago, it was going down the drain. It was terrible, what happened to Red Bank. It was sickening. I think all this new growth is great. Sadly, there is something people in my generation say all the time: " I used to be able to walk down Broad Street and know ten or twelve people as they walk by. But now I don't know anybody, and nobody knows me anymore." It was a little hometown, and it's not now. But it's wonderful, I think. I have no complaints about it at all. It is a little overcrowded, but then I was in real estate, so I helped to do that.    Mr. Aumack: Who do you work with in real estate?    Ms. Bramley: First of all I worked with the Applebrook Agency, the big agency around here at that time. It was owned by one family, and I loved working for the son and father both, and eventually was transferred to the Rumson office where I was the manager for a few years. Then it started to go downhill. The old father had died and the youngest son, as much as I've always loved him, did not quite carry through. So I left there to go to Rumson Realty, which was a really classy agency. I loved that. Eventually we sold to Coldwell Banker. I stayed with them for about three years and thought it was time to retire. It had become a different world. Coldwell Banker, a big conglomerate, just wanted your money.  There's no personal fondness for anybody. This is today's world  this is the way business is. Before long, everybody will be taken over by big corporations.    Mr. Aumack: What other examples in Monmouth County have you seen where big business has taken over small personal businesses?    Ms. Bramley: A lot of banks are crazy. Look at all the banks there are now. There's a bank on every street corner practically. There's no such thing as a "mom and pop" store anymore. Look at it that way. We had a cute little store in Fair Haven called Mack's Market for years. If at the last minute you needed a quart of milk you'd get the kids to get on their bike and go get it for you. It was right on River Road. It's now a French Hairdressers. It's right on River Road.  You knew everybody then. If you didn't have the right change, they'd say, "Oh, bring it back tomorrow." That type of thing. Even at Acme, you'd get to know everybody there, so that there is a sort of warmth there. But it's just not the same as it used to be.    Mr. Aumack: Would they take your change the next day because everyone trusted everyone back then, or was it familiarity?    Ms. Bramley: Well, I think both, because I think life was so much simpler.  I don't think it's a bitterness among our generation, but when we see our seven year old grandchildren  walking around with a five dollar bill in their pocket, we all think they need a depression. I would never wish that on them or on the American economy. Wives shouldn't work because they should be home with their children. I didn't have to go to work until I was widowed. But that's just a narrow way of looking at it. I understand that there's so much to own  it's irresistible to want to make more money to own everything.    Mr. Aumack: Why was life simpler back then?    Ms. Bramley: I'm trying to think of why it was simpler. I think there was a lot of innocence, for one thing. I don't think there's innocence, even for children, anymore. Just life in general was more innocent. It was probably an offshoot of Victorian times. My mother always said, "Oh, we lived in the best times," which was soon after the Victorian time. They hadn't had a war since the Civil War. I don't know, I think that little kids know too much. Of course, the old, evil TV has done that, but what would we do without it? I love it.    Mr. Aumack: You love TV?    Ms. Bramley: Oh sure. I think it's wonderful. I love the fact that I can have a new car every three years because I lease them, which I learned to do when I was in real estate. There are so many wonderful things that technology has brought on. I'm finally learning the computer.    Mr. Aumack: You mean with the Internet and everything?    Ms. Bramley: Oh yes. I didn't want to be left out. I don't want to miss anything. I'm finally getting one. I have marvelous neighbors all around me. The man next door is in the computer business at home. He designs programs. He was getting a new computer, so he said, "Oh, I'll give you my old one." Well, I wanted it anyway because my children do not live around here anymore. Both of my sons are now living in Maine. One's been living there for years, and he owns a very famous restaurant. It's twenty-two years old. Then my other little one (actually, he's a big one, he's six foot seven), he and his wife work at the post office in Rumson. Both brothers are very close. They wanted to live near each other, so they finally got transferred up there, and now they are only five miles apart. Douglas loves it there  he bought a new log cabin. Have you ever seen a log cabin?  They're pretty neat. It's on four acres in the Maine woods, I think it's great. I don't really have any quarrel with today's world. I do think it's mostly a lack of innocence. It seems a shame to me sometimes. Have you ever read John Wills' column? He writes sometimes in The Asbury Park Press, but he is a New York writer. He had articles about how today's humor does not seem funny. The sexual jokes and the body function jokes and everything else that is in movies. Some of the movies are really rotten. Do you think that, or is it just that I am an old lady?    Mr. Aumack: No, I agree. My parents have always told me that I'm a person of a different age, because I study history and I agree with a lot of the old values.     Ms. Bramley: But there are certainly many, many more things that are better than they ever were. Like health care. Many people survive many different things that they never did before, especially little children. They used to lose children and babies frequently. They must have been heartbreaking times. It is better now.    Mr. Aumack: I think that's a beautiful way to stop. I thank you very much.    Ms. Bramley: You are welcome. It was a pleasure.               
MonmouthCounty;Margaret Field;1928;2000;Margaret Field, 1928, 2000          Remembering the 20th Century: An Oral History of Monmouth County      Margaret Field, present day    Date of Interview: June 25, 2000  Name of Interviewer: Rita Cross  Premises of Interview: Unitarian Church of Monmouth County, Lincroft, NJ  Birthdate of Subject: September 16, 1928    Ms. Cross: You didn't live all your life here. When did you come to Monmouth County?    Ms. Field: We moved to Monmouth County the first time in 1954 or 1955 (you think you're never going to forget these things but you do)  my younger daughter was born here. Then we were in Pennsylvania for three years, near Harrisburg, from 1958 to 1961. That's when we moved back - to Fair Haven - in September 1961.    Ms. Cross: Where was your daughter born?    Ms. Field: Riverview Hospital.    Ms. Cross: Did you live in Red Bank?    Ms. Field: Yes, we lived in Red Bank in the old Hubbard house at 64 West Front Street.    Ms. Cross: What is the old Hubbard house?    Ms. Field: It's pictured in some of the histories of Monmouth County  it's where a Dr. Hubbard lived. It's a fairly old house. I don't know that it was distinguished from other old houses in Monmouth County other than it happened to get engraved and appeared in some of the old histories. Dr. Hubbard was a medical doctor and had his offices in the house. It's a three story mansard roof building. It had been made into four apartments at some point - one apartment to each floor plus the one in the basement, which my in-laws had. We were on the first floor. All of them had beautiful views of the river - even the basement, because it was only a half-basement, so to speak - it had windows above the ground - a big bay window on the river side.    Ms. Cross: Is it near The Bluffs and the library there? Or is it further east?    Ms. Field: Now it's right next to Riverside Gardens Park. There was a house between us and the park, the home of Dr. Walter Rullman, who was chief of surgery at Riverview for a long time. Some historic group in Red Bank tried very hard to save that house from the wrecking ball and was not successful, and it was torn down. So now 64 West Front is on the West Side of Riverside Park. Except now it's been re-numbered to be 62 West Front. And it's a part of The Bluffs - 62, 68, and 74 West Front, plus four more new ones that were built on what used to be the backyards of all three of the houses facing the street, have been fancied up to be The Bluffs. They look nice - the old ones and the new ones have been blended well - but they're all close together - multi-family - and probably very expensive! A driveway goes into it between 62 and 68 - when we lived there the backyard went all the way down to a bulkhead on the river except there was a garage to one side halfway down - but the yard was sloped to the water so the garage didn't interfere much with the view.    Ms. Cross: Where did you come from?      Ms. Field: I was born in Sibley Hospital in Washington, DC. My parents were living in suburban Washington, Takoma Park Maryland, at the time.      Ms. Cross: What brought you here?      Ms. Field: I went to the University of Wisconsin and met my husband there. He was born and raised in Fair Haven and had always wanted to come back. So that's how we happened to get here.      Peggy (left) and Barbara Lancaster    Ms. Cross: What were your impressions of the shore at that time? What are the changes you have seen? What were the things that you noticed and saw?      Ms. Field: I didn't notice too much change between when I first got here and 1961 when we came back, or even now, thirty nine years later. It seems like all of the vacant lots in Fair Haven are filled with houses, but I don't see a basic change - it's still basically a single-family residential area. In surrounding towns there are now a lot of condos - or town homes, whichever. And of course there's a lot more traffic - there are many more traffic lights along the route between Fair Haven and New Brunswick where I went to library school in 1969. Lately the downtown section of Red Bank has been refurbished and upgraded, and that's a good sign. I thoroughly believe in making cities and town livable rather than having people get disenchanted with them and tearing up more farmland so they can move out and go live there. That just leads to more sprawl.    Ms. Cross: Why did you go to Library School?      Ms. Field: I had volunteered in the Fair Haven School libraries, enjoyed it, and thought it would be as good a way as any to get college money for Barb and Peg. Nobody ever becomes a librarian to get rich, but at least I'd like what I was doing. And Martha Schofield, the Librarian when I volunteered, encouraged me to do it. I started working for the County Library in 1971, and married Jack Field, another librarian, in 1980. Jack died in 1990. He worked at the Headquarters library, and I started at the Hazlet Branch. We moved to Millstone in 1984. In that far western part of the county there has been an essential change just in the sixteen years since we moved there. The farmland is being torn up to make single family homes. So it's not different in that there are more single family homes, but so much of the area has changed from agricultural to residential.     Ms. Cross: Are you by Manalapan and Marlboro?      Ms. Field: Yes, but farther west. All up and down Route 9 there are strip malls. A lot of those are within the past twenty years. All through the rural areas they are tearing up the farms and building these enormous big houses that I think are wasteful of resources. They are also very expensive. In Upper Freehold, too, but not as much. There are still a lot of farms there - mostly horse farms and sod farms - a few other crops, too.     Margaret Field at a Library Association meeting with a cardboard cut-out of then director Jack Livingstone    Ms. Cross: When the bottom falls out, everything is going to be empty, probably. Tell me your experiences with the library, because I don't remember the library in Manalapan.      Ms. Field: It's a fairly new building and has been enlarged already. When I started with the library in 1972, the Headquarters was an old house at 80 Broad Street in Freehold Boro - which is back to being a private home again - then about six months later, in August 1971, it moved to a little strip mall at 25 Broad Street - that was a fifteen-year "temporary" location. And much too small - the new one in Manalapan was built int 1986 and opened for business in January 1987.      Ms. Cross: It's quite a time block.      Ms. Field: Yes. The county library started out primarily as a means of delivering service to areas that did not have any access to library service  mainly in the rural parts of the county.     Ms. Cross: Were you involved with the bookmobile?       Ms. Field: There were two bookmobiles that went out every Monday through Thursday, and occasional Fridays. I wasn't directly involved with them, though.    Ms. Cross: Tell me about Riverview. You said you had your child at Riverview Hospital.      Ms. Field: It was much smaller then, but starting to burst at the seams - at least it seemed so from my experience - there was no room available when Peggy was born so I had a bed in the hall for a day and a night. It's hard to sleep in a hospital corridor at night! Everybody was helpful and friendly, though - I remember it as a good hospital experience even with being in the hall. As far as medical practice goes, we had a general practitioner for most things  it wasn't a specialist for this and a specialist for that, as it is now. I don't really have anything very much wrong with me, but now I have to go to five different doctors to get it all checked. I had some ingrown warts on my foot  the general practitioner didn't do that. I had to go to a podiatrist. Gynecologist, dermatologist, dentist of course, that's different, internal medicine, gastroenterologist, nobody touches anybody else's body parts.      Ms. Cross: Do any fads or trends in your lifetime or any newspaper headlines stand out from the past?      Ms. Field: National things, but nothing particularly limited to Monmouth County.      Ms. Cross: What do you know about your ancestors?      Ms. Field: I don't have any ancestors from Monmouth  my mother was from Pennsylvania and my father was from Massachusetts. My first husband's father was a civil engineer and surveyor and was the resident engineer on the Rumson Bridge. That is the drawbridge that goes over from Rumson to Locust. His name was Lionel Lancaster.      Ms. Cross: Can you expand on that at all? What's his history?      Ms. Field: He was from Philadelphia originally. My first husband as a kid would spend his summers going out with the survey team, holding the rods for the surveyors. Then he became a surveyor, and someone else had to hold the rods. He and his brother used to say they had walked all over Monmouth County as kids. Their father had rolls and rolls of blueprints in his office, which was one room in the basement apartment. Dorn's Photo Shop did all his blueprints  they're still at the same place on Wallace Street where they were fifty years ago. Getting back to the farms in Upper Freehold for a minute, I should have mentioned that the next-to-the-last dairy farm in the county went out of business recently and the last one may not last much longer.  (Ed. note: The Search Farm ceased dairy operations in 2001)     Ms. Cross: Do you know where the farmers went?      Ms. Field: No. I think that what happened was as they grew old and the children didn't want to go into farming, they sold the land to developers and the developers built houses. There's the Farmland Preservation Program trying now to preserve the few farms that are left to keep them out of the hands of developers. But I think it's very little and very late. They should've started doing this twenty years ago  I guess they didn't foresee the magnitude of the problem. I saw a bumper sticker on a car yesterday that said, "No farms, no food," and of course the agriculture business has enormously big holdings, but not in Monmouth County. When there was so much home building in what was once rural Monmouth County, there was a need for libraries - and schools...    Ms. Cross: And more stores and more strip malls.      Ms. Field: Right. Marlboro had just a very small "reading room." Then, they built a library. The Marlboro municipal body has been very far-sighted in providing service. That small library has been enlarged twice and is now one of our busiest branches. Millstone and Upper Freehold don't have their own libraries. Their residents go to Headquarters in Manalapan or they go to the Allentown Branch. We have deliveries to Allentown twice a week - people can order books from Headquarters by phone or at Allentown and have them delivered to Allentown.    Ms. Cross: Are there any locations in Monmouth County that have personal significance for you?      Ms. Field: I guess just the place in Fair Haven where we lived for twenty years. It was a nice little house, and Fair Haven is a nice little town, and we were content there. That's where the kids grew up  they were very fond of Fair Haven. And I like history, so many of the historical sites are some of my favorites.      Ms. Cross: Like?      Ms. Field: The Monmouth Historical Association properties  -  Marlpit Hall, Covenhoven House, the Holmes Hendrickson House, Allen House - the place in Atlantic Highlands where Henry Hudson was reported to have anchored his ship and gotten water.      Ms. Cross: Oh, tell me about that. I don't know anything about that.      Ms. Field: It is below that road that goes between Atlantic Highlands and Highlands, Ocean Boulevard.      Ms. Cross: That's also called Scenic Drive.      Ms. Field: You go on Scenic Drive to Lawrie, then onto Hilton, and right where Hilton meets Bayside and goes down the hill there's a spring. The water comes out of a pipe in the wall. They've kind of bricked it up to make it a little place where they can put a plaque. I don't know if this spot is really where he actually anchored the ship, but it's said that he got fresh water from that spring. And then there's the Spy House and Monmouth Battlefield. They're gradually restoring as much as they can of the whole battle area to the way it was in 1778. Monmouth County is a very pretty area. I love Allentown - so many houses, and the old grist mill - the mill is The Black Forest restaurant now, on the first floor - there are shops on the two floors above it.    Ms. Cross: Did you see the notice about the place where they found bones?      Ms. Field: Yes. They found bones in Middletown, but it doesn't give any hint as to whether they were Indian bones or maybe of someone who died twenty years ago.      Ms. Cross: It was interesting though.      Ms. Field: Yes, it was. I clipped that article out. I do clipping for the library of articles having to do with Monmouth County and some New Jersey articles. And those I intend to offer to Gary Saretzky of Monmouth County Archives when I leave the county.      Ms. Cross: In what way is your life different now from what you thought it would be when you came to Monmouth County?    Ms. Field: I never thought I would be divorced, but I guess nobody does when they get married.      Ms. Cross: I think in our generation, and probably also young people, think that they're never going to get old anyway.      Ms. Field: Yes. They're never going to get old and love will last forever. But hindsight being what it is, I can't say the divorce was all bad - there are many good things that have come my way that never would have without it, though it was very hard at the time.      Ms. Cross: What would you say is the most unusual thing about you and also what's your greatest achievement?      Ms. Field: The most interesting thing about me maybe is my sand collection. I have a sand collection from different beaches all over the world.      Ms. Cross: In bottles?      Ms. Field: In bottles, yes. And I belong to the International Sand Collectors Society, if you please  it's very small.      Ms. Cross: I didn't even know there was one. What made you start?      Ms. Field: My father worked for the Department of Agriculture and went on a business trip to Italy when I was about eight. He brought a can of sand from a beach there just as an interesting thing. I remember thinking that was really real cool. I saved it and I don't think until I got to be maybe high school age did I start collecting sand, but I remembered that sand I had gotten as a kid from my father. So now I have all the states of the United States including Alaska and Hawaii and Washington DC and lots of countries. I also have some related things such as simulated moon dust. NASA brought the moon rocks back and analyzed their mineral content. They didn't want to squander that precious stuff by subjecting it to endless study, so they analyzed it, simulated it, and studied the simulated rocks. I have sand from every continent. I have sand from Antarctica.    Ms. Cross: You know what always amazes me is you see somebody in one dimension and I almost wish we could have an hour with everybody because everybody....      Ms. Field: Has a story.      Ms. Cross: I know, and different facets too.      Ms. Field: The sand from Antarctica is blown in by the wind from some other place and then the wind dies. It drops the sand down on the ice, and so this sand was not from under the ice, it was from top of the ice, but nevertheless it was picked up in Antarctica.      Ms. Cross: And how did you get this?      Ms. Field: Through the Sand Society. Most of the other ones I've gotten I didn't pick up myself but friends or relatives or friends of friends would bring samples to me. The club does a certain amount of trading. Interested members will trade, and some scientist who was on an expedition to Antarctica gave some to other scientists, and about ten people later it came to me.      Ms. Cross: Oh gosh, that's interesting. You just told me a little story about Antarctica.      Ms. Field: That's really one of the most interesting samples I have. For National Geography Week one year, Flora Higgins, who arranges these things, thought it would be cool to have a display of my sand, so that's what we did. We had a big map on the wall in the lobby with numbers  the sand samples were in the display cases and numbered to correspond to the map. I have about 500 samples now because very often people bring me sand, not knowing that I already have it from that place, and of course I can't bear to throw it out.      Ms. Cross: That's wonderful.      Ms. Field: Also you can get three samples of sand from the same state, but they can be totally different in color, or texture, or shape.      Ms. Cross: What would you say has been your greatest achievement?      Ms. Field: I don't feel I have any great achievements, but rather a number of small achievements, like every time I really, really help somebody with something they really, really needed at the library. That's a small achievement of a kind. Some of the times I felt that the information I gave them really helped them make a difference in their life and that to me is an achievement, if even a small one.      Ms. Cross: I agree.      Ms. Field: I haven't done anything to make me rich or famous or immortal or anything else but those I still believe are achievements.      Ms. Cross: Those small things. I have things like that too, where I've had an influence on somebody's life. I think they're wonderful achievements. What do you feel you still want to accomplish?      Ms. Field: When I retire, which will be not too far from now (I'm still working but I don't want to die in the traces), I'll be still working. I think I would do some volunteer work with service organizations, to give something back, or with some historical group of some kind. Maybe a literacy tutor - a person can do anything they set their mind to if they can only read.     Ms. Cross: I want to play with the cats. And I want to read for the blind, which I should do soon. Are there any people who influenced your life in Monmouth County?      Ms. Field: Lots of people in small ways, but I don't know if I can think of any right now except for Martha Schofield, the librarian in the Fair Haven schools. Some of my teachers did, but I didn't go to school in Monmouth County.      Ms. Cross: How did you come to the Unitarian meetinghouse? Were you born a Unitarian?      Ms. Field: Yes, I was born a Unitarian. My father's family has been Unitarian ever since there were Unitarian churches. My mother was a Presbyterian. My husband was a Methodist, and he thought that Unitarians were not much removed from Druids and Gypsies. So we went to his church, but when we were divorced, I said, "Okay, now I'm free to go to  the Unitarian church," so that's what I did.      Ms. Cross: And was it here?      Ms. Field: It was right here in Monmouth County, but it was the old building.      Ms. Cross: Which was? Oh yes, I remember when I came, they met where they have coffee now.      Ms. Field: They did everything where they have coffee now.      Ms. Cross: Harold Dean was here. What are your favorite books, television shows? Who are your heroes?      Ms. Field: I would have had to think about that ahead of time to be able to answer that one... I used to like Laugh-In and The Tonight Show, Murder She Wrote, and PBS shows. I've never watched TV very much and watch even less now. I've always loved the Sherlock Holmes stories and still reread them sometimes. And the Brother Cadfael stories. As to heroes, I'd say anyone who speaks out for justice or steps in to help other people or creatures in spite of great personal risk - things like that.      Ms. Cross: Is there anything more you want to add?      Ms. Field: It seems like I should say something different about the changes in Monmouth County. But whenever I think about it , I just keep coming back to the farms disappearing. It's just very painful to see another farm bite the dust. And particularly with the kind of houses they're building: they are not houses that the average family can afford to live in. It is very sad.    Ms. Cross: They are big enormous houses without any real charm.      Ms. Field: Yes, and they are just plopped down, not designed to embrace the landscape.      Ms. Cross: Yes, I know.      Ms. Field: When they landscape they just put a few little sticks in. But I'm glad that they are trying to preserve open land, even if they're starting so late to do it. Monmouth County came out third, I think, in a Money Magazine survey of good places to live in the country. And of course, everybody wants to come here, and they build houses for them. I'd like to see them build houses more like the one we had in Fair Haven - big enough, but cozy - and not like every other house on the block. Ours had seven rooms plus two full bathrooms  and a full basement - half of it was a playroom. It also had a secret passageway between the upstairs bedrooms, and a loft in the garage.      Ms. Cross: I know it's so expensive to live here.      Ms. Field: Yes, it is expensive. I'm thinking of moving out of Monmouth County when I retire. I may change my mind because of all the people that I've known for so many years.      Ms. Cross: Yes, that's tough. Is your family here?      Ms. Field: My daughter Barbara lives in San Francisco, and my daughter Peggy died eight years ago  those are my only two children. My grandson lives in Raritan, but he's twenty-five. He's free to go anywhere, so I wouldn't stay here just for him.      Ms. Cross: Where would you go?      Ms. Field: I'm thinking of Portsmouth, New Hampshire.      Ms. Cross: Do you know people there?      Ms. Field: I do now. Mostly it's New England that I know. I have ancestral roots going back to the early 1600s. There's water there as there is here, and that makes it pretty. There's a strong Unitarian church there. There's an historic restoration called Strawbery Banke - on the order of Williamsburg but one hundred times smaller - I could volunteer there. Good library, too. Lots of interesting shops and restaurants, distinctive architecture. In many ways it's a mini San Francisco.    Ms. Cross: It takes a lot of guts to go by yourself, when you don't have a husband.      Ms. Field:  I have friends and former colleagues in New England, although not necessarily right in Portsmouth. But another thing about Portsmouth is it's only an hour from Boston.      Ms. Cross: Oh, so you have a big city, too.      Ms. Field: Yes, a big city right close by with an international airport if you want to go someplace.      Ms. Cross: Sounds nice.      Ms. Field: And at present there's no income tax and no sales tax. The property tax, I have been told, is very high to make up for what they don't have in the way of other taxes.      Ms. Cross: They don't know what high is until they live here.      Ms. Field: It's about the same as here.      Ms. Cross: I have a little condo and I pay almost $3,000 in taxes, and you probably pay even more because you have a house.      Ms. Field: Yes, I pay something like $4,500.      Ms. Cross: Do you ever think of going out where your daughter is?      Ms. Field: No. San Francisco is a lovely place. It's beautiful to visit, but it's also very expensive and it isn't near any of the other things that I am familiar with. She's really the only person there that I know. And I think it's a mistake to go where your children are only because that's where your children are, because they might feel obliged to stay there because you moved in to be with them. And next year they might want to move to Minneapolis and here I would be in San Francisco. So no, I have never planned to move there.      Ms. Cross: My daughter is in Indianapolis and I said, "It's lovely here, and I just love it, but I don't know how long you're going to be here and I'm fine where I am." Like you, I have friends here and there's a familiarity about it. Somebody said something to me one time about Monmouth County: "Most Monmouth County women don't move away." I don't know why that is.      Ms. Field: I never heard that.      Ms. Cross: A lot of them stay here.      Ms. Field: I came here by accident, but I've been happy living in Monmouth County. It's a lovely place to live.      Ms. Cross: We have everything I think.      Ms. Field: We have everything and we're close enough to New York to take advantage of everything there.      Ms. Cross: I really thank you for taking the time and it was nice.       
MonmouthCounty;Mae Bahrs;xxxx;2000;    Mae Bahrs, xxxx, 2000  Date of Interview: September 1, 2000  Name of Interviewer: Flora Higgins  Premises of Interview: Mrs. Bahrs' office, Highlands, NJ  Birthdate of Subject:     Ms. Higgins: Well Mae, I just want to thank you for being a part of this Remembering The Twentieth Century, and let's begin at the beginning. Where did your people come from and how did they get to Highlands?    Ms. Bahrs: Well, my great-grandmother came over from Germany when she was fourteen years old, all alone. Of course I am sure she had a sponsor. Her name was Bertha Stahl.    Ms. Higgins: Did they come directly to Highlands?    Ms. Bahrs: Oh, no. They arrived in Newark, and Newark was where I was born, too. So on one side, my ancestors are German and on the other side, they are Scottish. My great-grandfather came from Scotland, and his name was Alexander Hamilton. But he wasn't the Treasurer of the United States.    Ms. Higgins: What did Highlands look like when you got here?    Ms. Bahrs: Well, I was a very small child, and it reminded me of a western town. Bay Avenue was a gravel road, and there were hotels all along. One in particular was Johnson's Hotel, right on the corner of Bay Avenue and Miller Street. That had rocking chairs, and it just looked like something you would see in a western town. My mother married Randolph Borden, who was a wonderful man. He had a business at 50 Miller Street. He had a soda fountain, candy store, ice cream store, and luncheonette and pool parlor.    Ms. Higgins: And this was your father's store?    Ms. Bahrs: My stepfather's store.    Ms. Higgins: What is there now, Mae?    Ms. Bahrs: It's an apartment house, small apartments.    Ms. Higgins: How long was the candy store there?    Ms. Bahrs: Oh, it was there from 1920 or so until he lost it during the Depression. But it was there for a good many years. In those days, pool parlors were a place for the town folk to socialize. It was a gathering place, and many people remember Borden's Pool Parlor.    Ms. Higgins: Can you tell us some of the other big hotels in Highlands back then?    Ms. Bahrs: Well, I grew up with Jenny Johnson. Her parents had the Twinlight Hotel on the Shrewsbury River, on the corner of Shrewsbury Avenue and Cornwall Street. That was a lovely, old hotel, and the steamboat Little Silver used to come down and dock at the foot of Cornwall Street. And people from New York came down. They were Norwegian people, but because they had a Swedish band on weekends playing Swedish music, they referred to it as the Swedish Hop. So it was quite a lovely place. Her mother had hand-crocheted bedspreads for all the bedrooms, but they gradually disappeared.    Ms. Higgins: The bedspreads did?    Ms. Bahrs: Yes, because people from New York came down on the boat and thought the bedspreads were so lovely, and they would find their way into the suitcases.    Ms. Higgins: Who were these people that came down? Where did they get the boat in New York?    Ms. Bahrs: Well, I guess they got it at the Battery. In those days the steamboats were prevalent, and there were many of them like the Mary Patton and the Thomas Patton. We presently own the dock that is referred to as "the Old Patton Line Dock."    Ms. Higgins: That's by the restaurant there?    Ms. Bahrs: No, it's right across from our office. That address is 26 Bay Avenue, which is the address of the dock.    Ms. Higgins: Were they rich people, or what kind of people were they? And how did they find out about the Johnson Hotel and the Swedish Hop?    Ms. Bahrs: Well, the people in New York didn't have cars then. Or not many of them, anyway. A lot of them came from Brooklyn, and there was a big Norwegian and Swedish enclave there. So that was the mode of transportation in those days, or they would take the train. There weren't any buses.    Ms. Higgins: Did the train come right into Highlands?    Ms. Bahrs: Exactly. The railroad bed is right behind this office, and the station was right where Moby's is now. I have good pictures of that.    Ms. Higgins: Well, we certainly could use that train.    Ms. Bahrs: It is such a sad thing that they did away with it.    Ms. Higgins: This comes up over and over in interviews, Mae. There was a widow from Union Beach who took the train to Red Bank to work at Eisner's. She talked about how sometimes they would get the connection and come over to Highlands. It is a great loss.    Ms. Bahrs: So right here at this spot was the McGuire House. That was a very popular hotel, and right across the street was the Cruze's Hotel, right where the Flowbar Apartment is now on 24 Bay Avenue. Cruze's Dance Hall was right on the river, and that was a wonderful place.    Ms. Higgins: Tell us about a dance there.    Ms. Bahrs: They had the name bands of the times, which nobody would remember now. One was Ernie Crickett that I remember, because my uncle played the banjo in his band. So I remember that one, especially.    Ms. Higgins: What kind of music did they play?    Ms. Bahrs: Jazz. We used to watch them doing the Peabody and the Charleston through the windows. It was really fun. Of course Bahrs Restaurant has been there since 1917. Coming down the street on that side, in the summertime they had Johnson's Pharmacy across the street.    Ms. Higgins: How about the Alpine Manor and Tempus Fugit: were they places people came from New York to visit? Wasn't that called the White Hotel for a long time?    Ms. Bahrs: I think where the Alpine was, I think that was named the Overlook Hotel. I am going to have to brush up on some of those names, whether that was the Overlook Hotel. Where the Stowaway Hotel was, that was called the Highlander.    Ms. Higgins: That's amazing. The population of Highlands must have tripled in the summer, at least.    Ms. Bahrs: Oh, it did. You almost couldn't walk down Bay Avenue. If you wanted to pass somebody, you would have to step out on the road and walk around them. It was so crowded.    Ms. Higgins: They came for the boating, the swimming, the fishing, or what did they come for? Did they come because it was cool? It's always cool here.    Ms. Bahrs: Yes, anything near the seashore is cooler. There were many summer cottages. Wherever there are condos used to be summer cottages.    Ms. Higgins: When did the seawall go up? Were people able to walk over to the ocean and swim?    Ms. Bahrs: Oh, yes. The seawall was there as long as I can remember, and that's back in the early 1920s. I remember when I first came down here, it was in February. We took a ride over to Sea Bright and the froth was coming over. It was stormy, and the waves were making this froth. I haven't seen it lately, but I thought it was snowing. And I got so excited because I thought it was snow. But it was white froth from the boiling waves, you know.    Ms. Higgins: Mae, how did you meet Al and become a Bahrs?    Ms. Bahrs: We used to take the train from where Bahrs Restaurant is from Moby's Restaurant, which was the train station. I went to school in Middletown and walked down there every day to the train. Of course we had candy to sell to pay for our Washington trip, and Al Bahrs was one of my best customers. So he bought a lot of candy, and that's how I met him.    Ms. Higgins: Why did you go to school in Middletown?    Ms. Bahrs: You had a choice of going to Atlantic Highlands or Middletown. Somehow a lot of us chose Middletown, and of course a lot chose Atlantic Highlands as well.    Ms. Higgins: Did Al's family own the restaurant then?    Ms. Bahrs: Yes. They have owned it since 1917.    Ms. Higgins: Did they build it?    Ms. Bahrs: Yes.    Ms. Higgins: Bahrs Restaurant is a Monmouth County institution.    Ms. Bahrs: Right. It started out as really a boathouse pulled up on the beach.    Ms. Higgins: Literally a boathouse?    Ms. Bahrs: Yes, I have pictures of that. It was literally a boathouse. Al's mother and father ran the restaurant until they got going and hired a cook.    Ms. Higgins: Was it always seafood?    Ms. Bahrs: Mostly seafood, yes.    Ms. Higgins: And that famous coleslaw: whose recipe is that?    Ms. Bahrs: Jack Bahrs' recipe, Al's father.      Kenneth, Al, and Bud Bahrs (left to right)    Ms. Higgins: Tell us about the family.     Ms. Bahrs: All three brothers were involved. There was Bud, Al, and Ken. I have a picture of the three of them.    Ms. Higgins: Mae, what would you children do for fun in the summer and the winter?    Ms. Bahrs: Well, in the winter during the school year, besides sleigh riding, our great thrill was that we loved to mind babies. My friend Jenny and I would run down the hill from school, change our clothes, and whoever could get there first got the cutest baby.    Ms. Higgins: Where were the babies?    Ms. Bahrs: On Cornwall Street. Our favorite was Richard Rast, because he was so cute. Whoever got to his house first, got him. And then the other one would settle for the next lovely child. We would take them for a walk over the bridge, and the drawbridge was there at that time. The bridge tender would blow the whistle when one of the steamboats was approaching, and we would run like mad to catch a ride on the drawbridge.    Ms. Higgins: With the babies?    Ms. Bahrs: Yes, with the babies. Can you imagine if the mothers knew that? (laughter) Of course the ends of the drawbridge were open! There was no gate there, and we weren't too adventurous with trying to wheel the carriage up to the edge of the bridge. Then in the summertime, we would go right down to the Miller Street bathing beach. There were bathhouses and a lifeguard. I remember one time I had a crush on Vincent Mendes, and this was during Prohibition. We were going out, and my cousin Peggy, who was down visiting from Newark, had a crush on his brother, Sidney Mendes. We were going out in the canoe. There was a hotdog stand there, and it was actually a pushcart. They bought us a hotdog and sauerkraut, and then Vincent couldn't go because he had to go home and wash beer bottles. His father had a speakeasy on Fourth Street, and he had to wash beer bottles. So his cousin came in his place, and I didn't care for his cousin. I think I was ten years old or so. So they bought us the hotdog and sauerkraut, and my cousin was three years older than I. She made me get in the canoe, and I didn't want to, if Vincent couldn't go. But I had to get in the canoe. I was so mad that I took the hotdog and threw it in the river, and I remember to this day the sauerkraut, roll, and the hotdog all floating down the Shrewsbury River. (laughter)    Ms. Higgins: In that current…whoosh. Happy seagulls.    Ms. Bahrs: Yes. Also at the beginning of Highlands, on the other side of the bridge, was Ahern's Hotel. Bartlet Ahern, who became a dentist. We had a lot of professional people from Highlands who became doctors, lawyers, etc.    Ms. Higgins: You also mentioned Dr. Weiss. Can you tell us about Dr. Weiss?    Ms. Bahrs: During World War II, he was transferred to Washington. He was working with some other scientists, and they developed the Atomic Bomb. My brother-in-law was a Navy captain, and he seemed to be working on that project, too. They flew him out to that site, wherever they developed the Bomb. They flew him out, but Dr. Richard Weiss went by train because they didn't want to lose him. He seemed to be sort of the main one, as I recall.    Ms. Higgins: And he grew up in Highlands?    Ms. Bahrs: Yes, he grew up here and went to Highlands Grammar School and Middletown Township High School, I believe. Then he went to Randolph Macon College, and I don't know where he continued his education from there. But he was a very brilliant man.    Ms. Higgins: Another famous person is Gertrude Ederle. Do you remember stories about her?    Ms. Bahrs: Oh, absolutely! Gertrude Ederle learned to swim in Highlands. She brought international celebrity status to the town. She was the first woman to swim the English Channel, and she learned to swim in Highlands. Her father lowered her into the water by a clothesline from the Old Patton Line Pier at 26 Bay Avenue. She trained for the Channel swim by swimming from the Patton Line Pier to the Battery in Manhattan, and also to the Sea Bright Bridge.    Ms. Higgins: Did you ever know anyone who had seen her swimming?    Ms. Bahrs: Oh, yes. My sisters-in-law did. They were called the Swift girls, which was their maiden name. Edna married Ken, and there was Helen and Elaine, and then Millie married Ed Gronindale. They all grew up together. They had the Twinlight Club out on the dock, and they spent their summers there.    Ms. Higgins: Mae, with Highlands being right here on the water, there seems to have been a lot of activity during Prohibition. Can you recall any stories about that?    Ms. Bahrs: There are a lot of stories about that, but I'd have to go back in my memory.    Ms. Higgins: How about World War II stories? I hear over and over from people who live on the coast about shipping and having to have their lights out, etc.    Ms. Bahrs: Of course we had to have the blackouts, and we had to have dark curtains and draperies at our windows. At the time, we lived up on the hill. The first house we ever bought is now the Nun's Home on Navesink Avenue, and that was a two-story home. We had to have curtains up with the shades drawn. And with cars, you would have to have the headlights covered as much as possible. I know I gave several pints of blood. We didn't have a car, or if we had a car, we didn't have the gasoline for it. So I used to take the bus over to the Methodist Church in Red Bank to the Red Cross, when they were having a blood drive. Through the years, I gave over one hundred pints of blood.    Ms. Higgins: Wow! Before we leave talking about the restaurant, can you tell us your most significant memories of maybe an important event that took place at the restaurant?    Ms. Bahrs: Well, I remember hearing about Texas Guinan. She was a guest at the restaurant back in the 1920s. I never met her, but I remember hearing that she was there. Of course many celebrities like Frank Sinatra were there.    Ms. Higgins: Frank Sinatra was there?    Ms. Bahrs: Yes.      Gertrude Ederle (cutting the ribbon) making an appearance at the opening of Brook Agency in Atlantic Highlands, 1968    Ms. Higgins: I remember my sister went to dinner there once, and she ordered two shrimp cocktails and two cheesecakes. (laughter) How did you get interested in the real estate business?    Ms. Bahrs: Well, Al was in the marine construction of docks and bulkheads. In my estimation, it was one of the most difficult businesses to be in. It was dangerous and very difficult work. I knew that it was getting to him, and I could see that. So I thought I had to get into something. I got my real estate license and was with the Brook Agency in Atlantic Highlands. Then in 1968, I opened our office in Highlands. And Gertrude Ederle cut our ribbon! I'll get that letter so you can read it.    Ms. Higgins: Mae, would you comment on the improvements in water transportation from Highlands and Atlantic Highlands and the proposed Belford Ferry? What is your opinion of that? What about water service in general, back and forth to the city?    Ms. Bahrs: I remember the history of that because the steamboats used to come down from New York with passengers, and they would disembark here. They had stops all along at Oceanport, Red Bank, and so on. The farmers used to send their produce back to New York on the ferries, like the Little Silver, the Mary Patton, the Thomas Patton and the Albertina. And horses used to be transported, too, from Monmouth Park to wherever in New York, to go to Saratoga, I guess. So when the Circle Line used to come down to our dock, I knew that they would be able to some day have this ferry service, which is so great for the commuters. It lessens the traffic on the Parkway, which is horrendous, as we all know.    Ms. Higgins: Is the Connors Hotel still operational?    Ms. Bahrs: No.    Ms. Higgins: I notice that's where the ferry seems to leave from that area.    Ms. Bahrs: The Connors Hotel has been demolished, which is very sad. It is now a parking lot. So that is very sad because we had our Class Night at Connors Hotel after our school burned around 1928, and the school was at the top of Miller Street hill and the highway, which is Navesink Avenue. We attended school in Highlands Firehouse and the Lion's Club, which is now the American Legion Hall. We graduated from the Marine Theatre, which is now the Lusty Lobster. And then we had our Class Night at Connors Hotel, and it was just like being on a movie set, in our eyes.    Ms. Higgins: Was the carousel in Highlands when you came here?    Ms. Bahrs: Oh, yes. That was a really fun place.    Ms. Higgins: I notice Katz's is still here.    Ms. Bahrs: It has been here a long time. We had Ed Levy's Vegetable Market and Joseph Cotton's Vegetable Market, and they were archenemies. They were side by side where the Highlands Post Office is now. They would keep putting their produce further out on the sidewalk until they were practically out to the curb, and people would have to walk around it. They had price wars, and they were always under pricing the other one, and people had a great time shopping.    Ms. Higgins: I see you have a Farmer's Market now. When did that come to town?    Ms. Bahrs: A couple of years ago.    Ms. Higgins: Are there farms in Highlands?    Ms. Bahrs: No, they bring it in from Fort Monmouth, Holmdel, or wherever people have small farms.    Ms. Higgins: What do you see as the future of Highlands, Mae?    Ms. Bahrs: Well, people are just discovering how beautiful it is, and how much there is here. Our hill is the highest point on the Eastern Seaboard between Maine and Florida, and you have heard that before. And we have the Atlantic Ocean, two beautiful rivers…the Shrewsbury and the Navesink, and a small town. We have more and more people wanting to move to Highlands because of the small town atmosphere, which has disappeared from many areas in the country.    Ms. Higgins: How can you keep it a small town with more and more people?    Ms. Bahrs: Well, it's not going to be easy. There just isn't any more room unless we build boathouses on the river. (laughter)    Ms. Higgins: Well the planning, though, seems to be holding. Highlands does look good, and there are always lots of good restaurants in Highlands.    Ms. Bahrs: Yes. Fortunately years ago, our town fathers had great vision. We had our own water department, and we had artisan well water. I have heard that they could pump 16,000 gallons a minute from the artisan wells. We had our own sewer plant, and we had our own incinerator.    Ms. Higgins: And you also had a vibrant clamming industry.    Ms. Bahrs: Oh, of course.    Ms. Higgins: Can you talk about that a little bit?    Ms. Bahrs: Yes. Many of the ladies in the town were widowed, or they worked to help their husbands, and so on. They had what they called "clam shanties." I remember them down at the foot of Miller Street. The women would get up and be down at the dock from four a.m. opening clams. They would have a potbelly stove for heat, and many of them had a wonderful sense of humor. They were joking and laughing, even though this was a difficult job. Their poor hands were cut and scraped, and they would open clams. As I recall, my friend Vera Fong's mother worked in the clam shanty. We used to go down there, and they would put as many clams on each finger as they could hold. Then they would fill a quart jar, and the clams would be packed in ice. Their husbands, or the men who owned the clamming business, would take them up to the city, mostly New York to the Fulton Fish Market. That was a daily procedure.    Ms. Higgins: A lot of employment?    Ms. Bahrs: Yes, it employed a lot of the ladies. Of course there were the men clamming and lobstering.    Ms. Higgins: Lobsters?    Ms. Bahrs: Oh, yes, there was a big lobster operation here. In fact I remember lobster boat races as a small child. There were parades, and baby parades, and beauty contests, and then lobster boat races. That was a big thing in the summertime.    Ms. Higgins: Do you see that business reviving as the water is getting cleaner?    Ms. Bahrs: Oh, yes, the water is getting much cleaner. As long as we can keep New York's stuff over there. I mean that's what happened here, but thank goodness for the people who were so active in Clean Ocean Action.    Ms. Higgins: Mae, Highlands has had some economic reversals, but now is making a comeback.  Can you comment on this?    Ms. Bahrs: Unfortunately, from 1927, the first hurricane that I remember, Highlands has had a hurricane about every seven years that knocked the socks off of everybody, particularly the business people on Bay Avenue. There would be anywhere from two to four feet of water, you know. Fortunately, we haven't had one since 1992.    Ms. Higgins: Are you better prepared for any others to come, or is Highlands just naturally prone to the flooding because of its position?    Ms. Bahrs: Well, I think all the sand they pumped in all along the shoreline, from Sandy Hook to Spring Lake or wherever they stopped, has helped. And that was only done during the past eight years. Then they put in a new steel bulkhead up on Marine Place, and I am sure that has helped a lot, along with all the sand. Whenever the ocean roared and overflowed, Highlands and Sea Bright would get it. I don't think either town has had a bad flood since 1992.    Ms. Higgins: On a more personal note, Mae, can you tell us about some exciting trips you might have had? Or adventures?      Mae Bahrs, Joan Donovan, and Pope John Paul    Ms. Bahrs: Well, I have been very fortunate in the past fifteen years or so. I went with a friend, Joan Donovan, to Rome, and we had a private audience with Pope John Paul. I remember at the time, he had just gotten back from Texas. I didn't know what I was going to say to him, and all I could think of was I was so glad he had gotten back from Texas. And that's what I said to him. He asked what we girls were doing here, and I blurted out, "Oh, I'm so glad you got back from Texas."    Ms. Higgins: I probably think he was, too. (Laughter)    Ms. Bahrs: Yes, right. Then of course, I have been to China, Alaska, England, Scotland, and Thailand a few years ago. My very dear friend started this school, and she was a retired school teacher. Her name is Agnes Shilling Hebler, and she started a school in Thailand. It was very successful, and my daughter and I went over with her to visit.      Three generations of Bahrs (Al Bahrs is seated on the left)  Ms. Higgins: Who runs the ship here when you are traveling?    Ms. Bahrs: Oh, my son runs it…Craig Bahrs.    Ms. Higgins: This is a real family business?    Ms. Bahrs: Oh, yes.    Ms. Higgins: Your roots are very deep in Highlands, aren't they, Mae?    Ms. Bahrs: Oh, yes. I really can't imagine living anywhere else. I know everybody when I walk down the street, and the little kids even say, "Hi, Mae!" Nobody calls me Mrs. Bahrs. I wouldn't know how to answer to that.    Ms. Higgins: I thank you so much for this interview, Mae. Is there anything you would like to say, in closing, like maybe advice to people who will be reading or listening to this interview in fifty or seventy-five years?    Ms. Bahrs: Well, I enjoy working and have worked really since I was high school age.    Ms. Higgins: Selling candy, right?    Ms. Bahrs: Right. Just have a dream and keep working toward it.    Ms. Higgins: Thank you, Mae Bahrs, thank you very much.    
MonmouthCounty;Lydia Wikoff;xxxx;1999;Lydia Wikoff, xxxx, 1999,         Remembering The 20th Century: An Oral History of Monmouth County      Lydia and Charles Wikoff, present day  Date of Interview: September 7, 1999   Name of interviewer: Lydia Wikoff  Premises of Interview: Ms. Wikoff's home, Manalapan, NJ  Birthdate of Subject: N/A    Please note: Ms. Wikoff conducted a self-interview as a part of Remembering the 20th Century: An Oral History of Monmouth County.     Q: Who were the people that influenced your life in Monmouth County?    A: I would say my family: my mother, father, aunts, and uncles. My father farmed, my mother taught  I respected her as a teacher because she put her heart and soul in it and almost to the point of neglecting her children  she was so conscientious. She really taught only because farming was not bringing in enough income.        Lydia's parents, Oliver Stillwell and Grace Hodapp Stillwell in 1912    Q: If you could talk to each person who made some mark on your life, what would you like to tell them?    A: I think I would tell my mother that I appreciated all that she did for us because we probably wouldn't have been able to stay on the farm without her efforts. I would tell my dad I loved him dearly and I learned many, many wonderful, lasting impressions from him.    Q: What locations in Monmouth County have personal significance to you, and why?    A:  Well, I would say this whole area.  I wasn't born here, I was born in Chesterfield, New Jersey, and when I was two years old, my family moved back to the original Stillwell homestead. I lived on that farm up until I was married. I can recall no other home than the farm at Gordon's Corner. I think I knew every inch of the farm, and I would play in the brooks and had special spots that I would hike to and sit, and we had a spring on our farm. My father would cart the water from the spring because our water was very -- we would always say irony, which meant that it had kind of rust in it, and it made everything rusty. So we carted all of our water for drinking and cooking and if we were washing white clothes.    Q: Is there any historical background on Monmouth County locations that you would like to share?     A: Well, I shared much historical information with people in my township. I've been the historian for the township for fifteen years and over the years I've answered questions about  history, genealogy, and  things that I think have been appreciated.      Lydia's siblings on far right, Eleanor and Hamilton, joined by their Appleby cousins, (far left) Betty, Ted, and Bud  Q: How would you describe Monmouth County in your childhood?     A: Well, it was so entirely different that it's hard for me to acquaint you with how it was. There were farms, blacksmith shops, and mills. The present Route 9 was then (1924-1939) a dirt road called The Amboy Road. It was a seldom traveled road. Parallel to that road was a macadam road leading to Matawan and Keyport. Before my time it was called Patten Turnpike: a toll road owned by Patten. These roads had tollbooths. One hundred years ago all the "toll" roads were bought by the county. This road was important as it lead to the Matawan and Keyport ports which ferried the farmers' grain, vegetables, poultry, etc. to New York.    To return to the dirt road in front of our home. My dad was called overseer of that section of the road. This meant that he scraped it to smooth out the potholes and bumps and he also plowed it in the winter. I believe that he must have been given something off on his taxes, but I really don't know. I recall vividly helping out cars when they would get stuck in the mud or snow.    The overseer was a farmer who lived closest to the road. He would have a scraper and scrape whenever it was needed. I remember there was a very muddy section on that road.  One time a car overturned and a very large woman passenger waited on our front lawn. She was covered with tattoos. We later found out that she was in the circus. This dirt road existed until I was fifteen years old. There was the advantage of living on a little used road as there was no thought of danger when riding bikes or playing near the road. We were the last in the township to get electricity and used kerosene lamps. Those Aladdin kerosene lamps are now considered valuable antiques, but I can assure you that it was no fun cleaning the chimneys on a daily basis. Running through our farm was a very narrow dirt road, which we called the New Road. When I looked into why it was named the New Road, I discovered that it had been purchased from my grandfather in 1835. When the township planning board was first organized, and were naming the roads, they named it for the adjacent brook, Pine Brook. A neighboring farm was owned by an elderly lady named Lib Quackenbush. She lived like a recluse  however, she did drive her horse and buggy to church every Sunday. We could almost set our clocks by her regularity as we would see her pass. One Sunday when the time had changed she was not aware of it, so my father went out to tell her. She was the last to drive her horse to Old Tennent Church and hitch it in the shed under her name. The church still has the plaque with her name on it.  Her farm is now the location of Covered Bridge, a retirement community, built thirty years ago. A historical society was started about that same time. Charles and I were charter members. We knew the history of that farm, which was owned by David Forman in 1732. We have a wealth of history about David Forman, who was a Revolutionary War hero in Monmouth County. The Society, called the Battleground Historical Society, asked the developer, Mr. Hovnanian, if he would save the oldest portion of the house. He graciously said that he would, and he saved that and the barn. The house has been boarded up since that time. The Society has asked The Covered Bridge Association, which now owns it, to make it available for public viewing. We hope that someday the people of Covered Bridge will appreciate its historic value and make it a historical landmark.  What is now called Highway 9 was built in 1939. As it was being built, and before it opened, we could ride our bikes for miles. A nice memory is that my husband, who lived in Tennent, rode his bike to see me. In fact, you might say, he courted me on his bike. We were high school friends, and following his service in the Army in World War II, we were married in 1946.  There have been so many changes that it is hard to describe the area as it was. We are just completely surrounded by developments now, so there really is nothing but our farm that is the same.    Q: Describe the significance of the souvenirs or keepsakes that you have.      Charles and Jane Wikoff, (Charles Jr.'s parents) 1944  A: Well, I have keepsakes that belonged to both families  my husband Charles' family had lived here in Freehold Township area since 1831, and they lost their farm during the Depression, but they kept many of their keepsakes. When both parents passed away, these things were divided among Charles, the only son, and two daughters. I treasure many of the things, especially a toy train that Charles' dad had. It's an iron train which he had gotten when he was ten years old, and it was his pride and joy, and it now is ours and I have it sitting in a prominent place in my living room. I have many old pieces that were given to me by a family called the Quackenbushes, who had no heirs, and so the nieces and nephews were bequeathed their estate. I was very young at that time, I think I was only sixteen, so my mother and father kind of picked out the things as we took turns dividing up the beautiful old homestead. In fact, in magazine articles, that house was called a mansion. It's just a shame that was torn down. It was in Marlboro Township, but very close to Manalapan on Wickatunk Road.    Q: What were your favorite books?    A: I had a great many favorite books  I loved the fairy tales, Grimm's fairy tales, and the Nancy Drew books.       George Stillwell is shown (ca. 1900) with his dog in front of his home near Gordon's Corner, Manalapan. George is Lydia Wikoff's grandfather. Seven generations have lived on this farm that is now farmed by her sons Charles III and James Wikoff, and her husband Charles Wikoff Jr.  Q: What do you know about your ancestors?    A: Well, I'm very interested in genealogy, and hence I know quite a bit about both my ancestors and also Charles'. The Wikoffs are very well recorded  they came in the 1620s and settled in New York, near Flushing. That was a farm area in those days, and that home has been restored. There's a Wyckoff Association, which got together enough funds to purchase the house and restore it. Right now it is on the historic register, of course, and New York State helps fund it and it is a museum and many school children visit it. We've been there to see it and it's just a beautifully restored Dutch cottage.    Q: What were some of medical practices when you were growing up?    A: They were very different then today. You only went to the doctor when you were sick, you didn't go on a regular basis. In fifth grade I had appendicitis, and Dr. Reynolds was the doctor. Freehold  had a hospital  that building still exists on West Main Street. In those days, I guess then they tried to freeze an appendix, so I was in the hospital with ice packs two or three times and that didn't work. So then Dr. Reynolds finally had to operate and he left me with a very large scar. People said he wasn't too great a surgeon. But I lived and I'm thankful. People used to have to go to Trenton, so at least I was lucky that the hospital was in Freehold.      Charles and Lydia Wikoff purchased this farmstead, built in 1851, on Tennent Road near Gordon's Corner in 1952  Q: What were the trends in your lifetime?    A: Well, let's see. Smoking was kind of a new thing, and I remember sneaking, learning to smoke. It was unheard of that a girl should smoke, or that anybody should smoke, my family thought. But I just did it just for the devil of it really, and didn't want to too much.  When I was working in New York I would smoke mainly because that was what you did when you took a break, but thank goodness the habit didn't linger with me very long. While I was growing up, our social life was quite different from that of today. Visiting among relatives was very frequent. Mother would invariably bake a cake as we looked forward to visitors over the weekends. One never would think of calling to say you were coming. In fact, not everyone had a phone.    Q: What else do you recall about your childhood?    A: Mother taught school in Hazlet, now Middletown Township. She and her neighbor, Mrs. Jameson, took turns driving there. The school held eight grades, and mother taught the fourth, fifth, and sixth grades. As it was a farming community, mother would often give the children who missed school, because of helping on the farm, extra help. Mother was a dedicated teacher. I have met some of the pupils that she helped, and taught, and bragged about what a great teacher she was. While she taught I was being taken care of by a loving neighbor. I even doubt mother paid her very much. It was just a wonderful growing up time for me. Our son, Charles, now lives in that neighbor's house. Their farm was adjacent to ours, and when we wanted to add it to our farm, we were able to purchase it.    Q:  What memories do you have of school?    A: Well, I have a lot of memories of school. I started out in Englishtown. In fact, to tell you the truth, I never knew the word Manalapan, and yet that's where I lived. But Englishtown was the hub  Englishtown was everything in those days. You would go there for the barbershop, you would go there to get your food, get your licenses, just do everything in Englishtown, so consequently it was very important to me. Englishtown was the headquarters with two grocery stores, a harness shop, clothing store, a barbershop, a bank, an ice cream store, and a bakery store. In fact, in the nineteenth century, the town of Englishtown was larger than Freehold. There was so much freedom when going to school. During lunch hour you could walk downtown to get ice cream, to get a haircut, or walk to the pond. During recess the teachers led us in outdoor exercises, and then we could play games such as Ring Around the Rosie, Alley Alley Over, baseball, marbles, and many other games that I can't remember the names of. A beautiful asset in the town was an historic village inn, which was a veranda tearoom, and on very special occasions we would get a guided tour of the inn. While I was growing up, people said it had been George Washington's headquarters for the Battle of Monmouth. Now that the inn is owned by the Battleground Historical Society, it has been researched, and we found that that fact cannot be documented. Going to school on the bus was fun. I had to be good, because the bus driver was a friend of the family. One day I was left off at my friend's house and did not tell my parents. They were very upset, and I suffered for that misdeed by going to bed without supper. I did not have playmates because of the distance between farms, but I thought nothing of that. I did miss not being able to join the Girl Scouts in town, though. But I had my dog Lady for a pet. She was an English Setter, and when she was properly bred, we could raise and sell the pups. I would spend hours playing with Lady and her pups. There were also many barn cats. A farm needed them to keep away the mice. My sister and I would dress them up in doll clothes and put them in a baby carriage and wheel them around, not always successfully, however. We always had one or two cows. When my father was milking the cows, he would squirt the milk up in the air, and the cats would jump to catch it. Dad would sit on a three-legged stool and squirt the milk into a stainless steel pail. It was a tricky job to maneuver so that the cow would not kick over the pail or switch her tail in your face. Most of the time we were overstocked with milk. This meant that mother would have to make pot cheese and butter  both jobs were very time consuming. A few regular customers came to the house for milk. Of course, it was not pasteurized, and when I first tasted pasteurized milk, I did not care for it at all. A big disadvantage of having cows was that they had to be milked morning and night. This meant that visiting was curtailed to accommodate milking times. When I was a child, that seemed to take away from the pleasures of visiting family and friends. But I really enjoyed helping do the chores on the farm when I was old enough. Some of the chores were gathering eggs, feeding the chickens, and taking food to the pigs and the horses. I felt really important when I was strong enough to help by putting hay in the hay mound. I would have to drive the horse drawn cart, which pulled the hayfork up and over the spot where the men in barn wanted to drop the hay. At that point, and very quickly, you had to unhook the rope from the two-wheeled cart, turn around the horse, and get back in position. This continued until all the hay was properly stored in the barn. These are things that stand out in my memory of my childhood. Another is of the tramps who were often walking the roads. They usually stopped in and asked for food. Mother would always make them something. They would hang around for a while, sometimes asking for work, but we were relieved to see them go. Another memory  highlight is of when I was nine years old and was able to attend the newly opened Radio City Music Hall to see the movie Showboat. Being able to go to a movie was a big occasion. I remembered mostly seeing Shirley Temple movies. As a teenager, I attended meetings at the Monmouth Grange, a farmers organization. These meetings gave us the opportunity to get together with other young people. Dances and card parties were also held.    Old Tennent Church played the most important part in my life as I was growing up. There were so many activities connected with the church, such as choir, picnics at the shore, the girls' bible study group, and helping out at the church suppers. My mother played the organ and the piano for all the events, so as a family we spent a lot of our time there. I recall vividly the sinking of the Morro Castle off Asbury Park, and the Lindbergh baby kidnapping registered deeply. My folks were so worried about an open well on our farm that they bought a concrete cover for it. During Franklin Roosevelt's presidency, he put men to work during the New Deal. Dad applied to terrace our hill, which was part of the CCC project to prevent erosion. I heard snide remarks like, "Look at those men leaning on their shovels," but that wasn't the case around here. Another F.D.R. project was a building of a town near Hightstown called the Jersey Homesteads. A part of that project was a coat factory. We would go there to buy our coats right from the factory. Now that town is called Roosevelt. Trips in the car were also big events. When the Holland Tunnel opened, we drove through it, as it was such an engineering marvel. There was a ferry which operated from Keansburg to New York, and that was a wonderful trip, too. In 1937 our relatives were visiting Lakehurst the day that the Hindenberg exploded. They came to our home from there to tell us about it. There was a lot of talk about the building of the Marlboro State Hospital. Even though we could not drive in there, we would drive by just to see those huge brick buildings. The Englishtown school had a ninth grade, but there was a time when Freehold High School was overcrowded and Freehold would no longer take outside pupils. Therefore we were bussed to Jamesburg, a small school of about seven hundred pupils. I believe that we were fortunate in attending that high school. But World War II was commencing, and many former advantages such as our trip to Washington, D.C. were discontinued. There was great patriotism at that time. It was felt by all, and many of our classmates enlisted. Two of them died in the war. My plans to enter Douglass College were changed, and instead I entered into the two-year Katherine Gibbs School. I close this episode of my life with the thoughts that growing up during those years gave me a sense of belonging to the farm. I am very thankful that after we married, and our lives continued to be in farming.      
MonmouthCounty;Louise Rosskam;1910;2000;Louise Rosskam, 1910, 2000        Remembering The 20th Century: An Oral History of Monmouth County      Louise Rosskam, April 2000 (photographed by Gary Saretzky)  Date of Interview: March 24, 2000  Name of Interviewer: Gary Saretzky  Premises of Interview: Mrs. Rosskam's home, Roosevelt, NJ  Birthdate of Subject: March 27, 1910  Deceased: April 1, 2003    Mr. Saretzky: Louise, it's a pleasure to be here and I am really looking forward to speaking with you. I know you have some wonderful stories that you are willing to share with me today, and for people in the future as well. You were born in Philadelphia?    Ms. Rosskam: Yes.    Mr. Saretzky: Can I ask you about your parents?    Ms. Rosskam: I was born in Philadelphia in a large family. By the time I was born, there were seven other children. My father had been an immigrant from Hungary, and he came to Philadelphia with two friends just after they were fourteen years old  boys were considered men at that time. And they all would have been put in the army if they hadn't left Europe. So they left and came to Philadelphia with absolutely nothing, no contacts or anything.    Mr. Saretzky: When was that? What was your father's name?    Ms. Rosskam: My father's name was Morris Rosenbaum. I am a bit hazy about what year that was, but it must have been around the 1850s or 1860s. When they arrived, there was no arrangement for receiving immigrants at all. They didn't land at Ellis Island  they landed in Boston. They didn't know anybody, but one of them decided that everybody should buy something, so he became a peddler. The other one had been a sort of a catered intellectual in Hungary, and he decided to sell books. And my father rolled cigars.    Mr. Saretzky: That was a big business in Philadelphia.    Ms. Rosskam: That's right. Eventually, the boy who was a peddler started a chain of department stores and became a millionaire. The one who liked books was named Charlie Sessler, who is well known in Philadelphia for collecting Dickens and Thackery originals, and he became very well known in the Philadelphia intellectual circles. My father gradually became a banker for immigrants who didn't know how to speak English or anything and didn't trust banks. He had sort of a safe deposit company, and he also represented the steamship companies which brought immigrants to the United States. If they landed in Philadelphia, they looked him up and he showed them how to get along and what to do.    Mr. Saretzky: Do you remember the name of this company?    Ms. Rosskam: M. Rosenbaum's. The office is still there in Philadelphia at 205 South Third Street. The building is there with an "M" carved on the top, but of course he had to sell it during the Depression. So our family doesn't own it anymore. He was very well known, and all of the three of them became very Americanized. They were all Jewish, but they didn't believe in carrying on their old Jewish background in an American country. My father was influential in forming a Reformed synagogue because he felt that if you were in American, you can't have all these prayers in Hebrew. Your children have to learn English, and even if they are going to be Jewish, they have to be American Jews.    Mr. Saretzky: And do you remember the name of the synagogue?    Ms. Rosskam: Yes, Rodev Shalom. It is still there, it's the big building on North Broad Street.    Mr. Saretzky: And how about your mother?    Ms. Rosskam: Well, her family had come to America before my father's family did. My mother's father had been a rabbi and was very intellectual. They had a stationery store in the Lower East Side of New York, where they settled. Her name was Hannah Rottenberg. But my father, who was rolling cigars and starting a business, really wanted to meet people he could talk to. So my mother's father and my father found each other and used to go to the stationery store, where they would sit in the back and would talk about religion, books, and things like that. But my mother was a pretty, young seventeen-year old girl, and my father had his eye on her. And one day he leaned across the counter and kissed her. She got mad and she slapped him, which is what you were supposed to do. She loved it, of course.    Mr. Saretzky: This was in New York?    Ms. Rosskam: In New York. So gradually he came to the store more often and then asked her father if he could marry his daughter, which was what you would do. She thought, "Oh that's great. I could get married, could get out of the store, and I could get all kinds of nice clothes and everything." So she said yes. And the first thing she did was to go out and buy all the non-Kosher food that she wanted. So she was a very gay young girl and she enjoyed life.    Mr. Saretzky: And so then they moved to Philadelphia?    Ms. Rosskam: They moved to Philadelphia after they got married, and he started his business. I have clippings, if I could ever find them, about his work with immigrants. He had two great friends in Philadelphia. One of them was Mark Blitzstein.  He worked for my father. There was a little group of people who had common interests. But my father was very active...he wanted to make Philadelphia a major port. He tried every which way to convince the powers that be to open the Delaware River enough to have steamships that would land in Philadelphia. But it didn't work very well. He was also on the Board of Education and he was very interested in the development of a good city and good family life. They still lived in the old Jewish neighborhood. His oldest son was very bright.    Mr. Saretzky: That is your brother?    Ms. Rosskam: He was my oldest brother. In the same neighborhood, a little bit north of South Philadelphia, where the Jewish neighborhood was, there was a very elegant neighborhood of very, very wealthy and important non-Jewish society people. My oldest brother was so bright that every once in awhile the school would send him to meet these people because they thought it would improve his understanding of American life. So he met all sorts of people...the Biddells and I forget all their names. When he got old enough, he didn't want to live at home with all the brothers and sisters because he couldn't study. So my father got him an apartment all by himself when he was about eighteen years old. When he went to college, he went to the University of Pennsylvania  he went through law school and became the top editor of Law Review and all that stuff. But I hardly knew him because I was very young and he was twenty-two when I was born.    Mr. Saretzky: Were you the youngest member of the family? How many children were there?    Ms. Rosskam: There were eight all together and I was the last one. The second youngest was my sister, who became a doctor. The one after that was a brother who never wanted to be anything but an actor, but he went into the travel business eventually. Two others were chemists. Another was a geologist, and then the oldest one became a real big shot in Philadelphia. He was a lawyer and assistant city...head of just about everything because his contacts were so great. But I never liked it very much because he was never home...he went off to England.    Mr. Saretzky: Could you just tell me the names of your brothers and sisters?    Ms. Rosskam: Which way do you want to go?    Mr. Saretzky: Start from the oldest.    Ms. Rosskam: The oldest one was Samuel R. Rosenbaum. The next one was a girl named Goldie Rosenbaum, and she married somebody named Lichten. The next one was a boy whose name was Ignatz Rosenbaum, which was Americanized as Archie. He was a bad boy, and my father made him join the army when he was just seventeen, and he became a Colonel. The next one was Eli, and he became a chemist. The next one was Robert, and he became a chemist as well. They were partners, those two boys. The next one was Paul, who wanted to be an actor and gradually went into the travel and real estate businesses. The next one was Katharine. She married three times. Her first marriage was to somebody named Guest. Then she was Katharine Boucout. Her last marriage was to Sam Sturgis, who was a doctor as well. And then came me. And my full maiden name is Leah Louise Rosenbaum. There was a twenty-two year spread between Sam and me.    Mr. Saretzky: So he was already out of the house by the time you were born?    Ms. Rosskam: Yes, he got a fellowship to England and he married an English woman. You know the old story about a father "reading you out" of a family? Well that's what happened. He married an Episcopalian. My father was a Reformed Jew, but he felt you had to keep your heritage. But my brother married an Episcopalian, and actually my father never spoke to her in her whole life. She died of cancer after they had two children. My father felt very badly about that. He didn't believe in private conveyances like cars. He thought you should take the trolley car and "be a part of the people." So anyway, he rented the first car he ever rented and got himself driven to my brother's house in Germantown. He sat outside of the house to talk to my brother and convey his condolences, and then he left. Isn't that horrible? I mean it's just unbelievable.    Mr. Saretzky: It's sad the way things can break up a family.    Ms. Rosskam: One of those children from his English wife is now very well known. Her name is Rosamund Bernier, and she gives lectures at The Metropolitan. I don't know if she would like all this stuff. My brother got to be very...in his final years he had so many "big shot" contacts that he sort of dropped his Jewish background. Since his wife was Episcopalian, she was buried in an Episcopalian church, and the children were brought up as Episcopalians. So, all this goes on in these families. It's unbelievable.    Mr. Saretzky: Well, it's very common in America for this to happen.    Ms. Rosskam: Yes. But you see I was the youngest, and I went to Jewish Sunday School. I learned a lot there, and it was great. Girls didn't have bar mitzvahs, but they had confirmations. I was supposed to give a speech at the confirmation. The rabbi was a friend of ours, naturally, or a friend of my father's. But I said, "I'm not going to belong to this Synagogue when I grow up, so I'm not going to make a speech." And the rabbi said, "You've got to make a speech. Your father organized this Synagogue." And I said, "Nope, I don't believe in it. Why should I be a hypocrite"? So he said, "All right. All you have to do to please me, and your father, is present this beautiful wreath of flowers to the congregation of the Synagogue as a thanks for your education." And I said, "That sounds okay, but I'm not coming back after that." And I never did go back until my father died. Of course I went back then. I don't know why I was like that...I have no idea.    Mr. Saretzky: Would you say that you had a happy childhood?    Ms. Rosskam: Yes. It was very, very happy. I had lots of friends. We lived in a house on the corner, and all the way down the street on one side were these porch houses. You could look all the way down the street. I had friends there, across the street, and around the corner. And my brothers and sisters were around, you know. My father used to bring in good people who used to be good influences on us...like a guest for dinner. It would be someone like Colonel Lipton of the Lipton Tea Company and people like that. There were musicians and philosophers, etc. So it was really great.    Mr. Saretzky: Now when you were a child, there was a large group of children sitting around a big dinner table. Were the children permitted to speak?    Ms. Rosskam: Oh, yes. Not only were they permitted to speak but.... We still had Friday night services. My mother really never gave up being an Orthodox Jew. She would pray over the candles, and we had a covered twist [a loaf of challah bread], and all that stuff. Then we would have this...well not much of a ceremony...but I always had to read Psalm 23 "The Lord is My Shepherd, I Shall Not Want..." I used to go through it in about a second. Then we all sat down, and we always had this wonderful dinner. There were all these people around the table, and my father would always try to be very "fatherly" and what not. But my brothers would be sitting there and taking spoons of water and flipping it at each other. (laughter) It was crazy...a lot of fun. But my brothers were really great. There are so many stories about that house, I don't know whether or not they would fit in this story.    Mr. Saretzky: Let me ask you one thing more about your brothers. Several of them went into science. You said they became chemists. Did that have something to do with you going into biology?    Ms. Rosskam: Oh, yes. Mostly my sister, because she always wanted to be a doctor. And she knew many, many doctors. But it was an accident, though, that I went into biology. I wanted to go to Wellesley College because my best friend went there, and I thought it was the height of intellectual elegance to go to Wellesley. I took the entrance exams, though, and I failed the math part. I didn't get in, and I was absolutely devastated. But I was very very close to the next one of my sisters. She wanted to be a doctor and go to medical school, but she eloped and got married, so she couldn't go to medical school. But she said to me, "Look, you don't have to go to Wellesley. It's just a waste of your time. There's lots to do right here in Philadelphia. You register at the University of Pennsylvania. They give you sort of a placement test, and you'll see, you'll be at the top of it." So I was! But girls were not admitted then in the regular University. They could only be in the pre-medical department or the architectural department, for some reason. So I went into pre-med. Then there is a really long story after that...because the Depression came. And my father lost everything, absolutely everything. I was a freshman in Cat Anatomy class, looking at the cat's circulatory system, when I got a call to go home immediately. So I rushed home and my father was home, which he never was. He used to leave at seven in the morning and come home at nine at night. And my father said we had lost everything and I would have to leave school.    Mr. Saretzky: How could he lose everything?    Ms. Rosskam: Well, all the banks closed. And his business was a bank. The money that he had for safe keeping was in the regular banks. He couldn't pay his customers any interest. So he was devastated. He had kept safe keeping accounts for all of us children for all of our lives. So he took all that money and paid off all his customers. We had zero.    Mr. Saretzky: So you lost your money, too.    Ms. Rosskam: Yes, even though I didn't know I had it until then. The oldest brother, the one who was a lawyer, was connected with a big bank in Philadelphia. I think he knew that the banks were going to close, because he came and told us we didn't have to leave our apartment...that he would take care of that. But I didn't know what to do, so I went back to school. The worst thing was that I was just seventeen years old. I said to my father, and this was horrible, "We can just sell apples." You know, that's what they did. And he cried...imagine my father who never cried in all of my memory. So I felt awful. I went back to college and I said, "I have to leave." And they said they'd work something out. So they gave me a job as the assistant to the guy who prepared all the material for the classes...the lobsters and the frogs, and all that stuff. So I had a job there.    Mr. Saretzky: So how old were you when you started college?    Ms. Rosskam: Eighteen. I had to go five years because I had a job all the way through. I made slides, did cell division, and I had all kinds of jobs, but always in that department. And I went to Woods Hole on a scholarship for a couple of years. I was really into biology until I met Edwin.    Mr. Saretzky: Tell me a little bit more about what you were trying to do in the field of biology.    Ms. Rosskam: Oh, I was trying to find out what was the origin of life...simple.    Mr. Saretzky: How far did you get?    Ms. Rosskam: Well I got as far as... I had a mouse cage on me in the basement of the lab building because they let me do my own research. I was studying genetics at that time. I was figuring out exactly how you inherited everything. That was in the air at that time. So all my mice had designs on their tails. They were little stripes. I baited these mice, and I carefully drew the design on their tail. They gave me these boxes because they didn't have enough cages for all my mice. So they gave me these square boxes, and I put chicken wire over the top. I put the mama and the daddy, with the marks on their tails, and I waited twenty-two days. Then they all had babies. I thought, "Oh great. Now they are a little too young to look at their tails. They're not really developed yet, so I better wait a week." So after a week I went down to my room in the biology department, and all the baby mice were out on top of the cages because they had gotten through the chicken wire. (Laughter) I couldn't take the measurements or anything. So that was a disaster, but that's how you learn things. Of course the department let me do whatever I wanted in my research. But I really wanted to find out exactly how things got started and how they developed. Of course nobody at that time knew the genetic symbols or anything.    Mr. Saretzky: That was before DNA was discovered.    Ms. Rosskam: Yes, it was before all of that.    Mr. Saretzky: Did you also have any teaching responsibilities?    Ms. Rosskam: No, just research. One of the professors there made all their slides, if you remember, that you had to use to look at cell division. Each box of slides had twenty slides in it. Each one had to be at a certain stage of cell division. She would get these cells that must have been from horses because they had very big chromosomes. She got these from the veterinary department. Then we had to slice all those up. First of all, we had to imbed them in wax. Then we had to slice them all up with a microtone and then spread them all out. Next we dyed them with this aniline dye, and then we looked at all of them to find all the stages. Then we would mount them on slides, put the cover-faces on, put the slides in a box, and so there were twenty, separate stages. And I had to do that for four years. My eyes were a wreck! But I got two dollars per slide, so I could pay my whole tuition.    Mr. Saretzky: That sounds like a pretty tough job.    Ms. Rosskam: Well, it was. I used to go early in the morning to find the right stages, and then the actual making of the slides got to be easy. The hardest thing was finding the stages. Of course you had to throw out half the stuff you had already sliced up and dyed because you had too many of one thing.    Mr. Saretzky: You had to catch it at the right moment.    Ms. Rosskam: Yes, that went on for five years. I had other jobs around and other interests while I was there. One professor gave me a job...well, it wasn't a job. He just showed me how protoplasm is elastic. You have to find out how elastic it really is because it will bear a certain amount of stretching. There is a big slime mold that grows on the bottom of tree trunks and all. He used to bring that in. I used to have to take two little wires and stretch it until it broke, and I had to record exactly how much...that was a stupid job. But the professor was very dramatic, so I stuck at it for about six months. Then I said, "The heck with this." But that was by the time I could graduate. I didn't bother going to my graduation because it was a year after my regular class, and I didn't even know anybody in that class. So I graduated in 1933.    Mr. Saretzky: And this was at Penn?    Ms. Rosskam: Yes, and I should have graduated in 1932.    Mr. Saretzky: So that's really at the height of the Depression and Roosevelt had just taken office at that point.    Ms. Rosskam: Yes.    Mr. Saretzky: And it was a very exciting time.    Ms. Rosskam: Yes, it was. As soon as I left Philadelphia and went to live in New York with Edwin, we really got into all sorts of things.    Mr. Saretzky: Why don't you tell me how you met your husband, Edwin Rosskam.    Ms. Rosskam: He had been a painter, and he had gone to art school in Philadelphia. He married a student, and they went off to Paris together. They were both painters, and then she walked off with his best friend. He got desperate and followed the trail of the painter Gaughin. He first went to Martinique, then to Tahiti, and then off to a little island called Raiatea. And he stayed there for three years. He got some kind of tropical disease, the woman with him got very sick, and left.    Mr. Saretzky: That was his first wife?    Ms. Rosskam: No, it wasn't his wife at all. This was just somebody that went with him on his trip. Anyway, he went into Tahiti and stayed there for about six months and recuperated. It's the story of this mural, actually. He met a lady there, an elderly lady, who had lived in China. This is all like a novel...but her husband had been a merchant of some sort in China. He traveled around all over, and she would often go with him. When they got up to north China, she came across an old barn with the roof gone. But the walls were intact, and they had these beautiful paintings on them. She got all excited and went back to Peking. She hired a group of workmen and drove all the way back up there. They cut this wall into twelve pieces, so she had twelve murals just like this one. She brought them back and sent them to the States to be kept for her upon her return. She put them in the charge of a guy who was the head of one of the arts projects in New York. Then the Depression came, and it really hit everybody. He lost his job then. But he had these murals he was storing, which he had put in a bank in San Francisco. He had been keeping them there for this lady, who would pay him for them upon her return. But she didn't know where he had gone or where the murals were. And he was very secret about where these murals were because they were his "lease on life." But he really couldn't sell them because they were very, very valuable and everyone would want to know where he got them. Then they would trace back to this lady. So while Edwin was still there, this lady asked him to see if he could find this guy when he got back to the States. She gave him his name, and he came back. He hung out at Romany's, which was a café for artists in the village at that time. The guy who he was looking for had been pretty well known...he was on the government payroll. Everyone said this guy was gone and that he probably was in some flophouse in New York. So Edwin toured all these flophouses and left a message with the desk clerks for this guy. The message was that Edwin needed to see him...that he had something for him. I don't remember this guy's name, but he was told that somebody had something for him. They gave this guy Edwin's address, and he went to Edwin's apartment. He was really ready to bash Edwin to pieces, you know. He just wanted to get the location of these things Edwin had. I'm a little mixed up about this...whether she had arranged to put them in the bank vault and this guy didn't know where they were or if it was the other way around. But anyway, he was threatening Edwin. And Edwin said, "You better not say another word, because I have a witness." And Edwin had somebody hidden in the bathroom who had heard all this stuff. So the guy left, and all Edwin found out was the name of the bank where the murals were, in San Francisco. So Edwin wrote or wired this lady, her name was Gray Worswick, that he had found the murals, they were in this bank, and she would have to get them out. It was very expensive because they had run up an enormous amount of storage. She told Edwin that if she got them, she would either give him $10,000 or one of the murals. And Edwin thought that would really solve all his problems! Then, about three, four, or five years later, when he was still living in the village, a great, big truck drove up with a mural. Not $10,000, but a mural.    Mr. Saretzky: The one in the brown frame there?    Ms. Rosskam: Yes, we've had it all those years. It's really fabulous if you look at it.    Mr. Saretzky: How did you meet him?    Ms. Rosskam: I was in Atlantic City. My mother was a diabetic, and I had to give her the insulin shots. So I had to go wherever she went, and I went down to Atlantic City with her. Edwin had come back from the South Seas, and he had had appendicitis. His mother was a friend of my mother, and they were staying in neighboring hotels. Edwin was bored to death in Atlantic City, you can imagine after a life like that. He said, "Aren't there any girls around here?" And his mother said, "Well there's Louise Rosenbaum, but she's a nice girl and I don't think you'd like her." But anyway, we did meet. I had a little, crummy camera, one of those little Kodak cameras. Edwin asked me what it was, and I told him it was my camera. He asked what I did with it, and I said, "What do you think? I take pictures." So he said he wanted to go and take a picture. We went down to the beach, and there was a boat. It was lying on its side on the beach, and it was a beautiful, sort of grayish day. Edwin said he wanted to take one of the pictures, so he took the camera. I mean I would have just taken the picture, but he walked all around until he got just the right shadow and everything and then took a picture. Then he said, "Let's go on the boardwalk and find a photography shop and get it printed." And I said, "Now"? And he said, "Sure." So we got it printed, and it was beautiful. It was absolutely a perfect little shot on a crummy, little camera. And I was really impressed.    Mr. Saretzky: Had you done much work with this camera before?    Ms. Rosskam: No, it was just a camera. I had no idea about photography. I had worked with a microscope a lot, but not photography.    Mr. Saretzky: Did you develop your own?    Ms. Rosskam: No, nothing like that. I didn't know anything. I did a lot of lab work, but not photography lab work. I made slides and things like that.    Mr. Saretzky: So he impressed you.    Ms. Rosskam: Oh yes. Not only that, it was very romantic. He had been in the South Sea Islands! Then when I got out of college, I decided to move to New York. Of course, it could have been because he was there! Anyway, I got a job with the Sheffield Farms company testing milk. And that was another sort of off-shoot of biology. I got paid, which was remarkable. I had an apartment with a cat. And Edwin had an apartment with a garden.    Mr. Saretzky: Nearby?    Ms. Rosskam: Across the street. Very strange that I rented an apartment across the street from him! (Laughter) Anyway, I used to have to go over to his apartment every day to get dirt for my cat's box. So we gradually got very friendly. He ran around with a lot of fascinating people who were artists, writers, etc. One of his friends had a marvelous shop where they serviced people's camera equipment. And that was interesting and part of science.    Mr. Saretzky: So did you make some good friends through him?    Ms. Rosskam: Oh, yes. First of all, we were together for about three or four years. It's hard to remember all the stuff, though. I feel like I'm writing a novel. But Edwin used to go up to Provincetown in the summer. And I had a job at a summer camp that wasn't too far away from Provincetown. Sometimes he would come to the camp. He liked the cook at the camp. She was a wonderful, wonderful black woman, and when Edwin came, she would make him some of her special fried chicken. So he came often. I don't know whether it was me or the fried chicken! (laughter) So we got more and more friendly. Finally I got a wire from him that said, "Come up to Provincetown. Get married." So I replied back, "No." I mean, why would you get married like that? But anyway, I did go up. There are so many of these crazy stories... When I arrived, he met me in Boston, and then we went back over to Provincetown on a boat that crosses over. We ended up in a bar, of course. I looked at the bar and all of a sudden there was a double-brandy in front of me. And I said, "I didn't order this." And the bartender said, "Oh, Rosskam's girls always get a double-brandy." Anyway, it was a lot of fun. It was a very loose time. After Provincetown, we both moved to Greenwich Village in New York. I had been in the Village before, but we moved into some other part of it. We were across from Bergdof Goodman's in an apartment that used to be the repair shop for that store. It had lights all over the ceiling. You know where the women used to sit at their sewing machines? So we had this wonderful apartment full of lamps, and we had a darkroom. Our friend, the one I told you about who did the repair of cameras, had a darkroom. And that's where I learned my darkroom technique. He was a marvelous teacher. I knew how to work in a lab already, but the only thing is that in a lab you have light, and in the darkroom you have dark. But I learned how to do the whole thing.    Mr. Saretzky: Did you and Edwin go over to the Photo League at all?    Ms. Rosskam: Yes we did, but we weren't active in the Photo League.    Mr. Saretzky: Well you had your own darkroom essentially, so that you didn't need their darkroom.    Ms. Rosskam: No, but we liked the people over there. We knew Sol Libsohn, one of the founders, and the other people that were in the Photo League at the time. Of course their work was really influential on Edwin. He had done photography in the South Seas, but it was very arty photography. I have some of it here. But it wasn't documentary in any way, and the Photo League was a very, very strong influence on Edwin.    Mr. Saretzky: In terms of doing more documentary-type work.    Ms. Rosskam: Yes. The thing about it is, I wasn't doing too much photography at the time. I was doing some because I had a better camera by that time, and I was a counselor at a camp up in New York State, right on the Hudson River. There was a brickyard there where they made the bricks that were sent down the river on barges, and I got fascinated with that. I did a whole, little story about that. I mean it wasn't very good because I didn't really know too much.    Mr. Saretzky: You started out as a biologist and eventually got more involved more in photography. Edwin started out as a painter and got more involved in writing and photography. Can I just ask you a little bit about him and how he made that transition?    Ms. Rosskam: In Paris, when he was a painter, he was a friend of Man Ray. He was one of the group that hung out at Le Dome. He used to go over to Man Ray's darkroom and see what kind of thing he was doing. He got interested in photography that way. When he wanted to go off to the South Sea Islands, he was going to have to support himself somehow. So he went to the Trocadero Museum. It is now called the Museo del Homme. He went there and said he was going to Tahiti. He asked if they would be interested in anything. They said they would be very much interested, and they asked him to do whatever he could. They especially wanted him to try to translate the local language into English...or French maybe. But I have this little dictionary that he put together. They also gave him the equipment to do whatever photography he could. And so he did do very beautiful photography, but some of it was.... There was one photograph of a woman with that disease that makes your legs all big...elephantiasis. He later made a painting of that, much later. But anyway, he photographed some beautiful things like palm trees with a beautiful design, etc. There was a leper colony near there. He got interested in what kind of life a leper lived, and he went and stayed with them for awhile. He actually took some photographs of them, and that's when he first started to write. He wrote a novel about this leper colony.    Mr. Saretzky: Was it ever published?    Ms. Rosskam: No, none of that was ever published. It was pretty corny, actually, but it was beautifully written. I have it. He threw it all away, and I rescued it out of the garbage. (Laughter) So that's where he started both photography and writing. When I first lived with him in New York, he was writing a book about the day in the life of an unemployed man. I think I showed it to you, didn't I? He had a friend of his who was an unemployed actor. They both decided they were going to publish a book. But the actor was unemployed, so Edwin thought they should do a book about one day in the life of an unemployed man in New York City. So they did. They did just about every darned thing you can imagine, you know. There were windows with the menus on them, etc. Of course his friend was the hero of it, and Edwin was the photographer. They put it all together in a book, but of course, it never was published. I do have the copies of all those photographs from that book.    Mr. Saretzky: I think you told me once that you heard something about it years later on the radio.    Ms. Rosskam: Yes, that's the story.    Mr. Saretzky: And you contacted the daughter of the unemployed man?    Ms. Rosskam: Her name was Zebisky. She was a well known actress...Grace Zebisky. (?)    Mr. Saretzky: Not Zebriski?    Ms. Rosskam: I don't know. I'm not sure. I think I have it written down.    Mr. Saretzky: So were you interested in the work that he was doing?    Ms. Rosskam: Because of my father bringing in all of these famous people, I became a hero-worshipper. This was even when I was little. So I had found a whole bunch of new heroes to worship, and Edwin was one of them! Of course he wasn't as famous as some of the others, but a lot of the people I knew were really "up at the top." So what did you ask me?    Mr. Saretzky: Did you get involved in the work that he was doing?    Ms. Rosskam: Yes. I was involved in a way. I wasn't writing, because I always had another job. I felt that his writing was absolutely wonderful, and I met all the people that one would meet when you were in that circle.    Mr. Saretzky: Was Ben Shahn one of those people?    Ms. Rosskam: No, not yet. We knew him a lot later. But there were a whole lot of famous names, but I can't recall them now.    Mr. Saretzky: Now at some point, Edwin began working on this series of books called The Face of America....    Ms. Rosskam: Yes. He had been born in Germany and lived in Germany as a child. Some of the people that he knew when he was little had come to America. There was a young woman whom his mother had known, and she had married a fellow named Gunter Koppel. He was a German from Munich. They had come over as refugees. He lived up in Croton-on-Hudson. When Edwin found that his old neighbor lived up there, we went up to visit them. Gunter said to Edwin, "Look, I'm here in America. I don't know how to get started. I don't have any ideas." Edwin knew he had been in a book publishing company in Germany, so he told him to start a publishing company. Gunter wondered how he was supposed to do that, and Edwin told him to think of something that hasn't been done and try it out. Gunter asked what hadn't been done yet, and Edwin said he didn't think there was a book on every big city in the United States. Gunter asked if he thought anybody would buy a book like that, and Edwin said they would if he made it so they couldn't read it in the bookstore. So Gunter told him ok. He told Edwin to pick two cities, that Gunter would finance the book, and they would see what happened. So Edwin picked San Francisco and Washington D.C. So we got started. We left and went to Washington, with this advance of money.    Mr. Saretzky: Was this about 1938, or 1937?    Ms. Rosskam: Well, I'd have to look in the books. I think it's around that time. Now when we were doing that book on Washington D.C., Edwin decided to do a chapter on each of the agencies, but to make it exciting and interesting. In the process, he did one on the Department of Agriculture. That's when Roy Stryker had started the photography project at the Resettlement Administration.    Mr. Saretzky: Stryker directed the Historical Section of the RA, later the Farm Security Administration.    Ms. Rosskam: Yes. So we had to go there and see what was there. Now all this time, you might ask what I was doing. Well I was sort of helping out. (I think I left a whole chapter out - we worked for a year on the Philadelphia Record before we started the Face of America series.) I mean I did all the darkroom work, the organizing of stuff, and the discussing of everything. But I didn't actually, at first, do the actual photography. That came gradually. I first learned the lab work. I was a really good printer. That was what I was used to anyway. So to get the nerve enough to hold the camera took a little while, but I kept watching how things were being done. When I finally did get a decent camera, it was a Rolleiflex, which was a wonderful camera to start out with. You can see exactly what you are doing. The only trouble is that you get belly shots of everybody because you hold the camera down here. So I had to learn to stand on chairs all the time. But that camera was a marvelous, learning camera. I still have that very same camera.    Mr. Saretzky: I want to come back to Stryker in a few minutes, but I'd like to ask you a question before we get to that. Did the first two books in the series, San Francisco: West Coast Metropolis and Washington: Nerve Center, both published in 1939, come before you got involved with Stryker?    Ms. Rosskam: The Washington book got us involved with Stryker, because we had to go there to look at the photographs for the book that he had.    Mr. Saretzky: That he had in his file.    Ms. Rosskam: Yes. There we saw the marvelous things that were going on there. After the book was out and Edwin had kept in contact with Stryker, Stryker needed an editor for the file. So Stryker told Edwin that he thought he really was a photo editor from all his experience with the books, and he asked Edwin to take the job. And that's how it all got started.    Mr. Saretzky: When the Washington book was put together, Eleanor Roosevelt wrote the introduction. Did he just go knock on the door of the White House? How did he get Eleanor Roosevelt's cooperation?    Ms. Rosskam: No. The time is all mixed up in my mind, but we had been on the Philadelphia Record when we first got officially married. We lived in Philadelphia.    Mr. Saretzky: That was a newspaper.    Ms. Rosskam: That was a newspaper. Edwin was the only person that anybody in the whole newspaper business had ever seen with a mini-camera.    Mr. Saretzky: A 35 mm camera?    Ms. Rosskam: Yes. And they thought he was crazy. They wondered how he got a shot with that little thing. But he got the idea, while he was on that paper, to do a thing called "Talks of the Town." It was once a week, and it was a consecutive story about something like the Philadelphia Orchestra or the Museum or the Zoo, etc. The editors gave Edwin three assignments, to try him out. And we were living in a hotel in Philadelphia then. We didn't have much money, but we did have a hotel room. I used to see people with their little boxes outside their window where they would keep their leftovers. We did three jobs, Edwin and I, always together. Either I was holding a light or an extra camera, or I was telling him what was happening, but we were always together. One of the assignments was the Philadelphia Bridge, and he was way up on top of the tower that holds the cable. I looked up and saw a plane coming, and I screamed...so he got that shot. That's how we worked together all the time.    Mr. Saretzky: And those stories have photographs and text together.    Ms. Rosskam: They had photographs and text, and he did both. The Philadelphia Record, though, didn't think that photographers should write their own text. So Edwin told him he had an assistant, which was me, and he said I would write the text and he would take the pictures. So Edwin said I would have to be paid also. And they told him they could only pay me with gas and oil. So that's how I got my first job.(Laughter)    Mr. Saretzky: That must have been very good experience that helped him when the time came to do a whole book.    Ms. Rosskam: Yes, we worked together on that all the time. On a book there were all these features that needed to be fixed like the layout, the printing, etc. Of course I was a good printer and so was he, but we worked together in the darkroom all the time. When we did the San Francisco book, there was an interview in which they asked how I met Mr. Rosskam. I told them in the darkroom! Of course they quoted that all over the place. But that's how we always were, so it's hard to say. My daughter Ani thinks it's terrible that I didn't get the credit all the time.    Mr. Saretzky: Yes, your name isn't on the title page in some of these books.    Ms. Rosskam: No, only the Towboat River.    Mr. Saretzky: We'll come to that. So how did you two get Eleanor Roosevelt to write the introduction?    Ms. Rosskam: To explain, I've got to go back to our work for the Philadelphia Record. There was a fellow named Roger Butterfield, who was one of the editors. Edwin had said that if ever took a job like that on a newspaper in Philadelphia, it would be for one year and that would be it. He didn't want to stay there long because he had too many relatives in the Philadelphia area! So he went to Roger Butterfield and told him he'd really like to get out of the country. He asked him if he could have an assignment somewhere else. Roger told him they really did need someone in Puerto Rico. They were having some sort of a revolution there, and there was a fellow named Pedro Albizu Compos, who is leading the revolution. He told Edwin he could go down there, photograph him with his cohorts, and get it back as soon as he could. The intended publication for the photos was LIFE magazine.    We didn't know anything about Puerto Rico, but Edwin had this way about him to "find a lead" always. We found that Mark Antonio, a politician in the Upper East Side of New York, was connected with Italians and Puerto Ricans. So we went and got acquainted with him. We just called him up and told him we had to go to Puerto Rico, and we asked if he could give us some information. So went up there, never having met him before or anything, and he was a delight. He bought us cannoli, do you know what cannoli is?    Mr. Saretzky: Yes.    Ms. Rosskam: Oh, boy, they were wonderful. He told us that if we went down to Puerto Rico to photograph the nationalists, of course we wouldn't meet their leader. But he said that other people were there, and if we really were sympathetic and wanted to know what was going on, then he would give us the names of some people to contact. So we went down to Puerto Rico. Of course, we felt that we couldn't get in touch with the nationalists if we were on an assignment for LIFE magazine, because we felt they would just tell us to go home. So we met the Governor and told him we wanted to take a little vacation for three weeks, because the United States already had a program going, and that's what we were going to photograph. We met these friends of Mark Antonio, and they were nationalists. See that picture there on the wall? That is when he got so sick later, and he painted his memories. Those were Puerto Ricans in the plaza in the southern part of San Juan, Puerto Rico. There had been a demonstration. The leader of the revolution and his followers wanted to have a demonstration, and they got permission from the Governor. They went to this plaza, and the Governor rescinded his permission. So the army was called out, and they shot at these kids, who were only seventeen or eighteen years old. They were very enthusiastic and they wanted independence for Puerto Rico. So a bunch of them were killed. And the worst of it is that the army came in from two sides, so some of the army people were shot as well.    Mr. Saretzky: So they were shooting at each other.    Ms. Rosskam: So the other young nationalists were put on trial, and they were convicted. These people in the painting were the parents of the nationalists' kids who had been shot.    Mr. Saretzky: I can see in the painting that there are bullet marks on the wall.    Ms. Rosskam: Yes, Edwin took a photograph of them. I didn't take that, but he did. So it was pretty hectic.    Mr. Saretzky: Where does Eleanor Roosevelt fit in?    Ms. Rosskam: Oh, I forgot. We both started to do a lot of photography in Puerto Rico. We had a lot of pictures of the conditions there. The reason the nationalists wanted to get rid of the United States was because the United States was being impossible. Horrible things were going on. So we had a very interesting collection of photographs. The man who became the Governor of Puerto Rico later, who at that time was a politician, saw the pictures and helped us a lot. He got to be very friendly with both of us. His future wife and I got to be very close. We also became friends with Ruby Black, who was a friend of the Governor's. She was a newspaper woman. Later she became Mrs. Roosevelt's secretary (or she had been before, I don't remember which way that went). But she told Mrs. Roosevelt about these wonderful photographs and the terrible conditions. So Mrs. Roosevelt saw our photographs. When the book was to come out, Edwin said to this publisher, "You know my name is nothing, and the book is going to be interesting. But it won't sell without some name, and you have to get at least a preface by somebody." And the guy said,, "Well, who do you think you're going to get, the President?" And Edwin said, "No, but maybe the wife of the President." So Ruby made a date for us, and we went to see her. And that's another whole story. The night before, we printed a dummy that we were going to show her. We used a kind of developer that makes your hands all black, and both of us had black hands. Marion Post, the photographer whom we had met through Roy Stryker, came to see the dummy. And the night before we were to show it to Mrs. Roosevelt, she dropped a cup of coffee on it.    Mr. Saretzky: Oh no!    Ms. Rosskam: So the three of us were up all night long, printing the new dummy, which was about twenty pages long. The next morning we arrived at the White House with black hands. (Laughter) But Mrs. Roosevelt was lovely, she really was. She invited us up to her sitting room. She asked Edwin if he'd like a cup of tea and...[transcriber unclear about what was said here] then she said, "I think the young man would like a table." Anyway, she looked at the dummy. There was one picture in the book of the Washington Monument, and way down at the bottom of it there is a little couple hugging each other. She said, "Isn't that charming?" And Edwin asked if she'd consider doing a preface for us, and she said, "Of course. I think I would love to do it." And Edwin said to her, "Mrs. Roosevelt, I've never hired anybody in my life. This is a professional job, and I don't know how to approach you." And she said, "I'll do it for love." So she did, and she wouldn't take any money. So that's how we got that preface.    Mr. Saretzky: In Jack Hurley's book, Portrait of a Decade, he wrote that Sherwood Anderson did the Face of America series. Now that isn't untrue, is it?    Ms. Rosskam: No, that's not true. He just wrote the text for Home Town, one of the books in the series. I don't remember Jack Hurley.    Mr. Saretzky: So it was Edwin who really did the Face of America series.    Ms. Rosskam: Oh, yes. Edwin's name was on it as editor, on all of those books. But anyway, Sherwood Anderson was another nice story. Of course, by that time, Edwin had been editor for Farm Security and worked with the photography file. It was the real face of America, it had all sorts of... He liked the name, Home Town, but then again, he had to have somebody launch it...somebody who was well respected. Obviously, it was Sherwood Anderson, because he had written Winesburg, Ohio and all sorts of other things. I have his biography, by the way. It was interesting.    Mr. Saretzky: So first there was San Francisco and Washington. They came out about the same time?    Ms. Rosskam: Yes. And in the meantime, the publisher went broke.    Mr. Saretzky: And was the next one Home Town? Or was it As Long As the Grass Shall Grow?    Ms. Rosskam: As Long As the Grass Shall Grow came out in the spring of 1940 and Home Town, which was about a small, midwestern town, in the fall. After he decided that he wasn't going to be able to do a book on every city because the publisher went broke, Edwin decided to do a book on every minority. As Long as the Grass Shall Grow was about Native Americans. The last one in the series was Twelve Million Black Voices, published in 1941.    Mr. Saretzky: For Twelve Million Black Voices, Richard Wright wrote the text. Oliver La Farge did the text for As Long As the Grass Shall Grow.    Ms. Rosskam: And Helen Post did the photography on that. You know, later we went back to Puerto Rico and lived there for eleven years. Both of our children were born there. And we had to leave and go to the States because Edwin had been working for the government of Puerto Rico for a long time. Luis Muñoz Marin was then running for Governor...or maybe he was already the Governor...I forget what the politics were. But Edwin had been in an outfit which was interested in native Puerto Rican culture. One of the things that they did there was to make little statues. They are little things that Puerto Ricans would put up on a little altar and pray to. They were all hand-carved and wonderful examples of local craft. Edwin had a friend who collected them. By that time Edwin was the head of an organization called Community Education, which tried to get each community to try to work out its own problems instead of depending on the government. And they made movies and little booklets and so on.    Mr. Saretzky: Let's just try and get the chronology down a little bit. That long period that you spent in Puerto Rico, that was after Edwin worked for Stryker at FSA?    Ms. Rosskam: Yes. After Stryker had already gone into Standard Oil.    Mr. Saretzky: Let's go back to the earlier period when Edwin joined the Farm Security Administration staff as an editor.    Ms. Rosskam: At that time, Edwin really couldn't get out to take photographs much. Both John Vachon, who was the other editor of the File, and Edwin wanted to be photographers. But Roy said they couldn't go out taking pictures because he needed them in the File. I had a job then. I really was a photographer then by that time.    Mr. Saretzky: And who were you working for?    Ms. Rosskam: When we first got started, I set up a darkroom. I was trying to just take some picture because I was always interested in kids. I had taught at a progressive school and so forth. I found an old friend who had a toy shop in Washington, who needed some photographs of his little girl. So I did a whole little study of his little girl. He put it up in the shop to show how nice it looked. And then I began to get requests to do this one, and that one, and this one, etc. So I did about fifteen or so of those. I always had the family give me a week's access to the house so I could come back and forth at any time such as in the morning, or when they went to bed. So I had a little study of each child. Then I would bound them and give them the extra prints. I charged $100 for each book, but I hated to have all these extra prints when they would like them, you know. So instead of charging for them, I would just give them the extra prints.    Mr. Saretzky: And these were all Washington families?    Ms. Rosskam: Yes. They were all very interesting people. But Edwin said my profession was costing him a fortune! (Laughter) So one day I got a call from somebody on Collier's, that there was an old sea captain coming in, and they couldn't find a photographer. I told them I couldn't photograph sea captains, and the lady told me to just bring my equipment and they would work it out. So I went. By that time I was using a speed graphic with a (4 by 5?) back and a lot of lights. Every shot had three lights because I wanted a back light, a highlight, and a fill-in light like this. Anyway, I had all this wire and junk. I got up to Washington with all this stuff, and here was this delightful old sea captain. I got all set up, you know. And he said to me, "Young lady, I think you should take the slide out of the back of your camera." (Laughter)    Mr. Saretzky: He was right!    Ms. Rosskam: But I did get the picture, and that was the first really professional thing I did. Another time General Stillwell came to Washington, and all the press was there. They were all doing black-and-whites and Collier's wanted a color cover. So here I come after all these "hot shots" with my little Nikon, and I had a way of holding the flash way off so it wasn't flat light. So I came last because they were all finished, and he was still standing there. I mean I was terrified, really terrified because this was a color shot. I had to dream up a colored background, and I didn't want to have a flag, you know. I forget what I did, but I had something in the background. He was very tired and annoyed, and he didn't like the press at all, so I thought I had better say something to him. So I said, "General, when you were out there, did you ever think of a big, fat juicy steak"? He said, "What?" And it was awful, but when you are getting started you make mistakes. I mean I really was not a real honest-to-goodness photographer. Kids were fine because you could play around with them and all that, but generals? So afterward, I did a lot of work on my own without Edwin, because he was busy over at FSA.    Mr. Saretzky: You said that he had some frustrations working with Roy Stryker because he wanted to go out and take some pictures.    Ms. Rosskam: That's right.    Mr. Saretzky: If I might ask, didn't he also want to give directions to the photographers?    Ms. Rosskam: Oh yes, he wanted the photographers to take shooting scripts. They didn't like that.    Mr. Saretzky: But Roy wanted to do his own directions.    Ms. Rosskam: Well, Roy had a different idea. He didn't believe in shooting scripts for people to follow. He thought that might frustrate them when they saw things on their own. They wanted to get the "feel" for things and didn't want to have to go back and ask permission to get the shot. Roy didn't think that was a good thing to do.    Mr. Saretzky: Did Edwin ever actually prepare shooting scripts?    Ms. Rosskam: He did, but they got to be sort of... I think they all exist somewhere... but Roy had another way of influencing people completely. He would just talk. He had them read stuff, like this book called Storm. Everybody had to read Storm. He was really amazing. But Edwin was very much more organized. How Roy ever got anything done, I don't know, because he was totally unorganized. Edwin was used to discipline, but they got along well. Some of the photographers didn't like it if Edwin wrote a shooting script, so they just didn't follow it.    Mr. Saretzky: Do you think Edwin would have liked to have had Roy's job?    Ms. Rosskam: Oh no, never. Never in the world...absolutely not. When Roy worked for Standard Oil later, we were in Pittsburgh. We were in a very fancy hotel because the Standard Oil people thought you had to live well. It looked like the wood was black. They hadn't taken all the soot out of the steel works yet. Even the cats on the street were black, whether they were white cats or gray cats. And the phone rang. We were sitting by the window feeling kind of gloomy, and it was Roy. And he asked Edwin if he wanted to go to Puerto Rico because his friend Rex Tugwell was Governor down there, and he wanted to start a File like theirs. He said Edwin was the only one that could do it. So Edwin asked when we would go...he didn't ask what we'd get paid or anything.    Mr. Saretzky: This was when Roy Stryker headed up a documentary photography project for Standard Oil of New Jersey, which I think is now Exxon. But at that time it was Standard Oil. Just to review a little bit about the sequence here, Roy Stryker had been the Director of the Historical Section of the Farm Security Administration. There he had engaged in a documentary photography project for the federal government. Then he, along with the FSA photo file, was transferred to the Office of War Information. And then after a relatively brief period, he left the federal government and got another position working for Standard Oil, where again he had the opportunity to hire photographers, some of whom were the same photographers he had worked with before at the FSA.    Ms. Rosskam: That's also when I was hired as a photographer.    Mr. Saretzky: After Edwin left the Farm Security Administration, you two went off and did something else for awhile. As I understand it, Edwin came back and worked with Roy at FSA, then at OWI. Roy went to Standard Oil and asked if both you would like to work for him at Standard Oil.    Ms. Rosskam: At Standard Oil, we worked for over a year. We really traveled together, and I did a lot of photography.    Mr. Saretzky: In his interview with Richard K. Doud, about thirty-five years ago, Roy Stryker said that you and Edwin worked marvelously together as a team.    Ms. Rosskam: We really did. We were always a team. Edwin was basically the idea man. He had been a painter and knew how to look at things, and I was sort of into the analysis because I had done that kind of thing at work. So when we went on a story, we were like one person, like a team. I don't know how to explain it. For example, if Edwin was doing something that needed three flashes, I would hold one and he would hold another, and we had a signal system worked out. Everything was coordinated in our lives. The same thing was true even when we traveled. When we were out in San Francisco, for instance, I know we had a darkroom and a Murphy bed. You would open the Murphy bed in the closet, you know, and it made a perfect darkroom. And I could set up a darkroom in half-an-hour. I kept justifying this to my daughter all the time. She said Pop was always the big shot and I just followed along, but that isn't the way it worked.    Mr. Saretzky: Now the largest project that you did for Standard Oil resulted in the book Towboat River, which really is a classic photodocumentary book.    Ms. Rosskam: Well, what happened was the Standard Oil Company had a magazine called The Lamp. And every issue of The Lamp had some photographs in it. We had some photographs  all the photographers did. Once we happened to be in Memphis and we saw these towboats using a lot of oil. And Standard Oil shipped oil. The towboats weren't really towing anything, they were little stern-wheeled boats, and they actually pushed a bunch of barges. And the barges had to be all connected so that they could be dropped off along the way down south. And that was all together a very complicated operation. It was absolutely fascinating! So we got on one of those boats, I think it was in Memphis or somewhere along there, and we went all the way down to New Orleans. Edwin, who was a really good writer, wrote the story. And it was published in The Lamp, and it got such a reaction that we thought it really could be a whole book. So Edwin made a dummy...did you see that dummy?    Mr. Saretzky: Yes.    Ms. Rosskam: And he took it to a publisher, and they took one look at it and thought it was great. They gave us a big advance, but we were no longer working for Standard Oil at that time. We were both off the payroll at that point, so Standard Oil had nothing to do with the publication of this book. There is one picture in it that shows "S.O." but other than that, there is no reference to the company. We went over to Pittsburgh where they were building these towboats, and I think there are some pictures of those. Then we went back up the Ohio River for awhile and then up the Monongahela River, where the big iron and steel companies are. And then...I'm trying to think how the oil got into the barges. What the barges did was to deliver the oil to various places all along the Mississippi and Ohio. But how did the oil get in the barges? There is a picture of it in there.    Mr. Saretzky: How long did you spend working on this?    Ms. Rosskam: Two years. Two full years.    Mr. Saretzky: And during a lot of that time, you were riding on these towboats?    Ms. Rosskam: Yes. We would get on a towboat in Pittsburgh, for instance. Then we'd go down maybe to...I'd have to look at a map. Then we'd get off that towboat and get on another towboat, until we got all the way.    Mr. Saretzky: How did you persuade the captains of these boats to take you on board, host you and feed you, and let you live on them for such a long time?    Ms. Rosskam: The captain of the boat was always getting paid for his work by the Standard Oil Company, because they contracted with these barges to be delivered. So we always had an introduction from them. I think...I don't know.    Mr. Saretzky: It sounds like, "Well, let's go to work on this boat for a couple of years, and it's like a free hotel room, and we'll see the world from this boat." And you said the food was marvelous and the people were great.    Ms. Rosskam: You know, I honestly don't know how we did it! But obviously they gave us introductions because when we started in Pittsburgh, our introduction was to the shipbuilders who were building boats. Now the Standard Oil Company didn't own those boats, but they did own the barges.    Mr. Saretzky: So you had that helpful connection.    Ms. Rosskam: Yes, that must have been the connection.    Mr. Saretzky: Now one of the aspects of this project that I find really fascinating is that you also recorded their voices. You and Edwin really were pioneering oral historians.    Ms. Rosskam: Well Edwin was, because he drew that up. He had worked with Roy Stryker on the Historical Section, which had similar objectives. When we worked for Standard Oil, everywhere we went, we really tried to get the feel of what the people were talking about and how they were living. But we never recorded anything then. When we started Towboat River, Edwin thought we really never got to remember everything the captain said. So he went to some sort of business company, and he asked how their stenographers recorded what they said. Of course by that time, they weren't taking shorthand anymore. There were these round discs called "Soundscribers." He asked if they were really reliable, if you could really transcribe them on a typewriter. They asked him if he wanted to hear it, and they demonstrated it for him. And then he told them he needed three microphones, and they told him that would require an awful lot of wire. And Edwin didn't care, so he got them to make a setup where there was a recorder with three microphones. He had one, I had another, and the captain had the third. This way three people were always recording. Sometimes it was just the captain, or maybe it was just Edwin, and sometimes I just said what I was going to have to do. But it worked out fine. We had all these discs and soon as we got to a place where we could hire a stenographer, we had them transcribed. By the way, I don't remember how we got paid for all that time. At Standard Oil we got so much money that we didn't know what to do with it all. So I guess we used that money to do this book, because each of us got a hundred and fifty dollars week, and at that time it was just a fortune. We didn't use it because we didn't really need it, so we probably put it in the bank or something.    Mr. Saretzky: So in a way, Standard Oil indirectly funded this book.    Ms. Rosskam: Yes, that's right. But I don't ever remember getting paid while we were doing it. I know we got a big advance, and then we got royalties. So that's how it must have been, now that I think about it.    Mr. Saretzky: When this book came out, the reviews were marvelous. You shared some of those with me, and I was so impressed by reading the reviews. They just raved about this book! It was interesting to me to see that at the same time another photography book came out by Clarence John Laughlin, Ghosts on the Mississippi, which was about the old mansions. And they compared your book to his book, and they said your book was a superior book. And that book has been reprinted a number of times and is well known today. Why did your book never get reprinted?    Ms. Rosskam: I don't know, it would be great. Of course, it's way out of date now. We never even thought about it, we just loved the whole two years. It was marvelous. We didn't have any children then, so we could do it. Life on the boats was absolutely incredible. Sometimes you could walk all the way out on the tow to the very end, and I used to love to do that at dusk. You'd hear the boilers swishing and the lights along the shore...it was like another country.    Mr. Saretzky: Looking at those books, this one being really the last in a series starting with San Francisco and Washington then the one about the Native Americans and then Home Town and Twelve Million Black Voices, and then this one, they are all wonderful books. But to me, this one is kind of a peak. You spent two years working on this book, and it shows. It is a wonderful book. Why wasn't there another one after this?    Ms. Rosskam: By us you mean?    Mr. Saretzky: Yes.    Ms. Rosskam: Because you couldn't find another one like that, that would be in any way like it.    Mr. Saretzky: Wasn't there ever another topic about which you got enthusiastic and wanted to do a book about?    Ms. Rosskam: Well, let me try to think where we were. I'm trying to think why there wasn't another topic.    Mr. Saretzky: This book was published in 1948.    Ms. Rosskam: Then we went back to Puerto Rico, that's why. We got totally involved in life there, not only the life but the politics there. See we had met Luis Muñoz Marin before when we left the Philadelphia Record. We had met him and he and Edwin hit it off right away. Once we got into Puerto Rico, it was such a totally different life. We also got involved in the politics there.    Mr. Saretzky: You didn't first go there as a result of Roy Stryker?    Ms. Rosskam: No, not at all. We went there from the Philadelphia Record, we were there just for two months.    Mr. Saretzky: That was a short time.    Ms. Rosskam: Yes.    Mr. Saretzky: But then you went back.    Ms. Rosskam: Yes. The reason we went back was not because of Roy but because of Rex Tugwell. You see Roy and Tugwell were professors together.    Mr. Saretzky: Roy reported to Rex in Washington. Rex was the head of the FSA.    Ms. Rosskam: Yes. That's right. Tugwell got down there on this own. He had been in politics in Washington. When he went to Puerto Rico, first he was Dean of the University. Then he was appointed Governor. He wasn't elected, he was appointed. And he was the first decent Governor they ever had. He and Muñoz Marin got along very well, but they were on two totally different levels. There are stories about that that are just fascinating. Anyway, Tugwell was a very pompous kind of guy. He was brilliant, and handsome, and all of that, and he was super organized. He instituted the Planning Board, which they had never had before. Before, somebody would say to the Governor that they wanted to be the head of this department, and that was it. But Tugwell really organized their economics, which was a disaster. Muñoz tried to keep people happy. So I remember one night, Tugwell made a speech and he was picketed. Muñoz made a speech the next day, and they loved him. There was a story about that...I wish I could remember the wording. Muñoz said, "Why are you picketed and I'm not?" But anyway, I forget how the rest went, but that was the difference between the two men. Everybody loved Muñoz and adored him, and people resented Tugwell, although he made their life possible.    Mr. Saretzky: Maybe he was cooler?    Ms. Rosskam: He was organized and used to government organization where you have a....    Mr. Saretzky: Bureaucracy.    Ms. Rosskam: Yes, a bureaucracy that works a certain way, and that was the way it had to be. The Planning Board was what he organized there, which was wonderful. But the people hated it.    Mr. Saretzky: So when was it that you came to Roosevelt, New Jersey, here in Monmouth County?    Ms. Rosskam: Well, after we had gone down there and gotten so involved because Edwin had started that whole government photography file there, he and Jack Delano worked together. Jack's wife, Irene, worked with them too. They started this sort of a propaganda outfit, really. It was not supposed to be run by the popular party  it was supposed to be run by the government. They set up an organization which was called Community Education. The idea was, and they sold this idea to Muñoz because he hadn't thought of it yet, to get the people not to be dependent on the government for everything. Jack, Irene and Edwin thought of this. They wanted the people to be able to organize themselves and get things going for themselves. The problem was, they didn't know enough to do that. There would be people who had never left their little town to go the neighboring town in their lives. So the idea was to show the people a bigger picture of their lives, really...not just their tiny, little town or home. They set up little organizations in the little towns all over the island, and somebody was the, well not the mayor because that would have been too official, but perhaps would be a local teacher. They would produce material for that person to use. They made these little booklets, and they made movies, and they made posters. They would go around with an electric generator, and Jack was the one who made all the movies. Edwin tried to hire local writers, but he never could find any writers so he had to do most of the writing himself. The photography was done by all of us. They would take a generator and go up to a little town. First they would put the posters up that there was a movie coming. Then they distributed these little books, because the kids could read them to their parents. Then the night came when they were going to show the movie, and they came with their generators and screen and everything, and all the people would be coming from all around.    One of the first ones they did was on boiling your water because there was so much dysentery around. So they showed this water in a big can being boiled, and then they showed these big flies which carried germs. The very first one that they showed, the people said, "We don't have to worry about that. We don't have big flies like that." (Laughter) So they had to learn a lot about making movies for so-called "primitive" people. Anyway, they worked on that for ten years. And all that time Muñoz was the elected Governor. The first elected governor there was Jesus Pinero. Then Muñoz was elected. Community Education was getting a little worried because in order for them to get funding, Muñoz had to put them into the sports and recreation department. They should have probably been in the university, but the university didn't want them. The university wanted their own funding. For about five, six or maybe seven years they were in the sports and recreation department. Then they decided that, since they were an education organization, they really ought to get an educator because none of us were educators. We didn't really know what we were doing. We just did it. So Jack, Edwin and Irene decided they should bring in an educator. They found this guy named Fred Wale, whom I think was at Columbia. They invited him down and showed him what they were doing and all, and he got fascinated and accepted the job. But sooner or later, he took over. And he ousted Jack, Edwin and Irene. And that was a disaster. I mean it was a disaster for Jack, Edwin and Irene.    Mr. Saretzky: And then you came back?    Ms. Rosskam: No, we didn't come back right away. Muñoz got very sore about the whole thing, and he insisted that Edwin move into the Governor's Palace and run his publicity. So we stayed for a few more years. Jack became head of the Puerto Rican National Television Station, and Irene started the Tourist Guide. It was beautiful...you never saw one like that before. I have lots of copies of it. And I had two children.    Mr. Saretzky: Were your children born in Puerto Rico?    Ms. Rosskam: Yes.    Mr. Saretzky: What are their names?    Ms. Rosskam: We didn't want them to have names that didn't work in both Spanish and English. The first one was called Susan Emma Rosskam, and Emma was her grandmother's name. Everybody there called her Susa, which is bad because it means "dirty" there. But we didn't realize that. And Anni's name was Anita Louise Rosskam. "Anni" is the way you would say her name in Spanish.    Mr. Saretzky: So after a few more years working Muñoz, then you came to New Jersey?    Ms. Rosskam: Well, what happened was, things began to get very politically hot. Edwin's organization was really trying to show people their own work, See those little statues over there? They are called "Santos," and the people would make a little altar and that's where they would pray. And they would make these statues themselves, and it's a real art form. Now they are collector's items. One of the people who was a very good friend of Jack, Irene, Edwin and myself, made a collection of these statues. So we all thought that this would be a very good thing to show in the art museum. It would show that the people could produce things themselves. They didn't have to go to the store and buy them. So they had a wonderful exhibit but unfortunately, at the entrance of this exhibit was a large "Santo" of Jesus, and he had a very big penis! (Laughter) So there was a Catholic guy there who was violently anti- Muñoz. He absolutely hated Muñoz. He came down to this show, and he published a big article in the paper that Muñoz was sponsoring pornographic images was against the Catholic Church. Oh, I tell you, it was a disaster! They accused Edwin of being a Communist, and the whole thing kind of broke loose. So by that time this new head had come in, and Edwin was really working for Muñoz. Muñoz was running for Governor on the third or fourth term, or something like that. We thought we were really standing in his way. We were very, very, very close friends. Edwin decided we better think of going. There were other reasons too, including our daughters. Life for girls there was very formal. You have to move with important people, you know, and all their girls "come out" at the age of fifteen. They have to have gowns that cost $500, and we didn't think that was going to be good for our girls to grow up that way. So that was another reason that we wanted to come back. We wrote to everybody that we knew in San Francisco, and we wrote to Ben Shahn, who was a friend of ours by that time. And his wife Bernarda answered immediately. She told us to come to Roosevelt, that it was a wonderful place in New Jersey. She said there was beautiful scenery and we wouldn't have to worry about our children if they got lost in town, somebody would bring them back. She also said that down the road there was a pre-fab factory, so they could build us a studio. We considered all the other ideas, and we felt that this sounded the best. So we came here, and it was really complicated. The house they had found for us wasn't for sale, and we had to park our children in Atlantic City at my sister's house while we hung around here to try to find another house. And that's how we got involved in Monmouth County.    Mr. Saretzky: And this was in the 1950s?    Ms. Rosskam: This was in 1952. By the way, at first we thought the scenery was horrible. It was all flat and we couldn't find any ocean, so we went swimming in a big lake down the road. But anyway, we did begin to get adjusted to it, and people here were so friendly. After we had lived here quite awhile, Muñoz' older daughter married somebody who was working in New York City in the slums. It was very bad for those children because they weren't allowed out on the street, so they decided to move here near us. This would mean their children could be free. And that was funny because the children had never actually played with other children before. They used to have to sit in the window and watch everything going on like sniffing gasoline out of the tanks of cars, swiping stuff, and all that type of thing. So the first thing they did when they came here was to decide since all these cars were sitting around with the keys in them, they could get stolen. In New York, you didn't leave your key in your car. So they took all the keys out of the cars up and down the whole street, and they threw all the keys away. (Laughter)    Mr. Saretzky: They threw all the keys away and nobody could go anywhere?    Ms. Rosskam: That's right. It was awful. They had been caged up there on the fourth floor where they lived, and the children across the street were allowed to go out. They had a bird, which was in a cage, and when everybody was out one day, they decided to release this bird. They thought it was mean to keep something in a cage. They felt they had been in a cage for some time, so they released it. Of course, there was all heck to pay, and luckily the bird didn't fly away. He flew up into a curtain rod, so they got him back. Our friends, the Muñoz family, would come to visit all the time.    Mr. Saretzky: Their parents.    Ms. Rosskam: Yes, and they came with their bodyguards. They had a car in front and one in back. He liked to drink a lot, too. One night he was sitting right here, and he drank a whole bottle of Irish whiskey. But he wasn't an alcoholic, he just liked drinking, I guess.    Mr. Saretzky: Did you have a very active social life here in Roosevelt?    Ms. Rosskam: Oh, yes.    Mr. Saretzky: Was everybody going to everyone else's house?    Ms. Rosskam: Yes, absolutely. It was very open. As a matter of fact when we moved into this house, it had venetian blinds that I didn't like. So I asked a neighbor, who was helping us, how I could get other blinds. So she said to me, "What do you like, privacy?" So we never did get any other blinds. So that's the way it was. People were very friendly. The whole town was friendly. Of course, now it's different, because it's a whole new generation. At that time, there were only about three or four non-Jewish families in the whole town. It was the only town where there was no church but there was a synagogue. And that was active. We had never been very religious. I hadn't been as a child and Edwin had been in Germany and wanted to forget the whole thing if he could. It was a very traumatic thing, you know. I suppose that should have made us want to be more Jewish, but we had lived a very free life of artists, writers, painters and so on. And we never really thought about being Jewish, although we didn't say that we weren't or anything like that, like my older brother did, whom I resent to this day. Down in Puerto Rico, the big holiday is Three Kings Day. The children put something under their bed with some water, and the Three Kings come and eat the treat, drink the water, and leave a gift. It's like Santa Claus, except it's the Three Kings. Then when the Americans came down, Santa Claus started coming around, so they started to have Christmas trees. Then came Hanukkah, for everyone who was Jewish. So there were three holidays. When we came here, we had a Christmas tree the first year. Ani had a little friend that lived up the street. She came into the house and said, "I didn't know you had a Christmas tree. I thought you were Jewish." So Ani told her she was half Jewish and half Christmas! (Laughter) So that's the way it's been really.    Mr. Saretzky: Did you and Edwin get at all involved in the government of the town?    Ms. Rosskam: Oh, yes, sure. I was on the Board of Education, but Edwin never ran for anything here. The first year when we first came up, he really went into a decline...a real decline. He just could not adjust to leaving Puerto Rico, with the situation and the politics there. He just couldn't seem to do anything. It was very serious. But luckily he had a wonderful, old friend we had known for years and years in New York. He was a doctor, but he was also a psychiatrist. Finally, I told Edwin he had to talk to Frank, that it was getting ridiculous. So Edwin went in and started to have talks with him. His name was Frank Safford. Frank told Ed that he was a writer and shouldn't be sitting around. He asked him if he had a typewriter, and Edwin told him yes. So Frank told him to go home and write. This was a year after we got back from Puerto Rico, and so then Edwin started to really write. He wrote Alien, a novel about Puerto Rico.    By that time he was fine, and I was working at the school. And he was still doing jobs for Puerto Rico. More and more Puerto Ricans were coming up to the States. The first thing he did was a movie on how to prepare people to and what you would need when you got here, like having to need a coat and all the ways to adjust to being up North. So that took quite awhile. Then we went back to Puerto Rico for a whole year, because Muñoz wanted Edwin to do something for the party. I think it was a movie they were going to make. So we stayed there for a whole year. The kids went to school there. We traveled back and forth.    Mr. Saretzky: And you kept the house?    Ms. Rosskam: Yes. We had a friend who used it as his studio. He was writing a book. It was such a close community here. Dave Martin lived across the street, we'd go back and forth, and it was like one family. Maybe it was mostly the writers and artists, but the other people were just as friendly. By the way, since we're here in Monmouth County, Ben Shahn had told me how beautiful it was around here. I used to go driving around and think it was beautiful, but it was so flat. But then I began to notice the farming, and it was really an eye opener. In Puerto Rico there is just a burst of color all the time, and the farming is mostly growing sugar cane and tobacco, but nothing that you could eat. Driving around here, it took me about three years to be able to really see Monmouth County. Gradually it got to be so interesting that I began to photograph vegetables, farms, and things like that. And then the real turnabout was...well I guess I didn't tell you about when Ben died. That was just horrible for everybody. He used to like to stay up late at night. He would come and sit here, and he liked some of the things I used to make like little fruit tarts. He and Edwin would just talk and talk, and they got to be so close. It was almost like one family. Their daughter babysat for my kids, and Bernarda and I got to be very close friends. We had our own little group. And then Ben got cancer, and it was a very long illness. First his liver went on the blink and he was in the hospital in New York. Anni used to work for him in his library. He liked Anni a lot. She used to draw, and he let her sit in the studio and draw for him. He asked Anni one summer what she was going to do, and she told him nothing. So he told her he'd give her a job. He told her to come to the house every morning at ten o'clock, start at one end of the bookcase and go all the way down to the other end, and put a little mark on the outside what it is. But he told her that she had to look at all the pictures first. That was pretty decent of him. That was when she wasn't even in high school. So she went over every day and looked at every book, and she put a little mark on the outside. Of course Bernarda had a fit about it, because she felt it spoiled the cover. But that's the way it was, and then he died. It was just awful. Anni was at Solebury School at that time, and I thought she would have a nervous breakdown. She was so fond of him. And Edwin was devastated. And that's when Edwin got the idea to write the Roosevelt book. First he wanted to write a book about Ben. He went to the publisher he was dealing with and suggested the idea. That was Dick Grossman of Grossman Publishing. But Dick thought it was too soon, that he shouldn't think about it yet. He told him to think about something else about Ben to write about, so that's when Edwin decided to do the Roosevelt book, where he taped all the people's conversation.    Mr. Saretzky: Tell me about Roosevelt, New Jersey: Big Dreams in a Small Town & What Time Did to Them.    Ms. Rosskam: He wanted to do a book really as a tribute to Ben. Ben was like the king around here. But he didn't want to make the book just about Ben, so he decided to think about the town itself because Ben had introduced us to everything about the way the town started, etc. Edwin thought there were a bunch of people around there he didn't even know. So he got a tape recorder and started asking people if he could tape their stories about how they got here and how they felt about it and so on. I've got a great bunch of tapes in here that he did. Sometimes they would come over and sit here, and sometimes he would go there. He taped about seventy people at least, including Bernarda and other good friends of Ben's that had ideas about him. By that time, I was teaching in the school, so I didn't have much to do with all of this. I didn't even always read everything because if I had, I would have cut out one sentence -- one woman got so mad that she never spoke to him again.    Mr. Saretzky: Was it true what he said in that sentence?    Ms. Rosskam: It was absolutely true, but it was very derogatory. Then he had a neighbor of Ben's transcribe the whole thing. She wrote down everything, and then out of that he made the book. He had to work from that. We had gone to Venice. I had gotten sick and thought I would have to have an operation, but it ended up I didn't have to. So Edwin asked me what I wanted to do to celebrate, where I would like to go. And I told him to Venice, never giving it a second thought. He went and bought the tickets, and we went to Venice. We stayed there for a few months, and in that few months this book came out. And our name was mud. The residents of Roosevelt got angry if they weren't in the book, and they got angry if they were in the book because they felt they were misquoted. Sometimes they weren't even quoted and they said they were misquoted! In the book, all the names were changed. And when we got back, we found out that they were circulating a dictionary that told who the names really were. So it was a little difficult.    Mr. Saretzky: Why was it decided not to use the real names of people? Was it because it was too frank?    Ms. Rosskam: Yes, it was too frank, and it was almost like fiction. I don't think he could've used their real names. He would have had to get releases, of course. Actually one person came to me and said Edwin had done this whole tape on her, and she wanted to destroy it. She wanted me to get it for her. I did and took it over to her. She was the mother of four girls and evidently, she didn't want the girls to read what she had said. So I destroyed it right in front of her...tore it up and threw it away. That was the only one that had an objection.    Mr. Saretzky: But Ben Shahn's name was used.    Ms. Rosskam: Oh, yes. He had died but Bernarda talked a great deal about him, and so did a fellow named Ed Schlintsky. Did you ever know him?    Mr. Saretzky: No.    Ms. Rosskam: Well he was a big character...a fascinating character. He also has died, but his former wife still lives here. He was a marvelous, unusual artist. He did papier-mâché caricatures. They were big ones, and they were wonderful. And he also painted and drew, and Ben influenced him a great deal. He loved Ben, and Ben was very fond of him. So Edwin interviewed him a long time about Ben...the two of them talked about Ben. That was really the high point of the book, I think.    Mr. Saretzky: Let's go back to the pictures that you were making of Monmouth County. You did some barns.    Ms. Rosskam: It was after Edwin died, which to me was like the end of the world because we had never, ever been apart. All those years we were always together and always doing something together. Even if we weren't doing something, we were together. I mean we had one little "up and down" point, but everyone has that. Sherwood Anderson solved that problem. I was getting very dependent on Edwin when we were first together in New York. I was just following him around. Edwin just moved up to a hotel, so I decided I had better start doing things on my own. It was a wonderful chance because PAC, the Political Action Committee, was very active. And that's where I really got to know Ben and David Stone Martin and all. I started photographing these lines of people waiting to vote, and one of them is now in the Library of Congress. They bought it. So I really got out on my own then. That's when I took the picture of the man in the zoot suit, later used in Twelve Million Black Voices. But one night, Sherwood Anderson came over and asked me to go to dinner with him. I said fine, and we went to Charles...that fancy restaurant. Did you ever know that restaurant in New York?    Mr. Saretzky: No.    Ms. Rosskam: Anyway, we spent a nice time talking. And then we went the five flights up, and he took me all the way home. As we got to the door, he told me he thought I should call Ed. And then he walked down the stairs and said goodbye. So I wondered why he said that...he saw Edwin every day. I thought maybe he knew something, and so I did call Edwin. And he was back at the apartment in about fifteen minutes. That was the end of that problem. But really the thing was, it had gotten me out on my own. I went out with a camera without Edwin, and I found out I could do it. That was really the beginning of my getting up the nerve to really do photography.    Mr. Saretzky: What happened when Edwin passed away?    Ms. Rosskam: He had been sick for six years, and I just never left the hospital. I was there all the time. Before that, though, he had started to paint. He painted his memories, and he hadn't touched a canvas from the time he got divorced. It wasn't the kind of painting that goes on these days, but to me they were wonderful. Every one is somebody I know and that he knew. Finally he had lung cancer, and I was at the hospital all the time. And Anni was there most of the time, too. One day the doctor told me he didn't think Edwin had a chance, so I said we were going to take him home then. They told me I couldn't handle that, but Anni and I got in the car with Edwin and came home. Luckily we were involved in a thing they call hospice care, so the nurses came. This one particular nurse told me that whatever happens, day or night, just get on the phone and call me, and I'll be right over. She lived in Monmouth County somewhere. And really they are angels! They are wonderful. So really I couldn't handle it anymore. He had been in bed all afternoon, but a whole bunch of people came over because they knew how sick he was. And we had an intercom system set up. And all of a sudden we hear, "Hey, what the heck is going on in there"? So one by one everybody went in and talked to him. I didn't even know that he could even say anything at that point. But anyway, that night he died at about four in the morning. That nurse stayed. The Monmouth County nurses are unbelievable. We could be right with him, Anni and I, and the nurse. So it was very hard.    After that, I just couldn't function, you know, for quite a while. So finally I decided I had to do something. I decided I would take a camera and go ride around and see what happened. So I began to see water, and it looked so calm. And I thought I'd just photograph water, wherever I found it. So that picture right behind you was the first one I took. It's of a little lake up above Roosevelt, and you can even see little fish down at the bottom. That started the whole business of going all over photographing water. My grandchildren lived in Virginia, and they went to stay in a motel, where I stayed with them. There was a swimming pool, and I tried photographing that. That makes fabulous water pictures, and then the beach and everywhere. So that got my cameras going again.    Mr. Saretzky: How about the barns?    Ms. Rosskam: Bernarda and I went to Spain together on a trip. We stayed in the little town of Denia, in the south of Spain. The government had taken over all the farms, you know. So there were no farmers left. But they had made these stone farmhouses there, and they were all dilapidated and falling in. I had rented a car there. Bernarda was writing a book, so I would drive around with my camera. I kept seeing these dilapidated barns and finally I stopped at one of them. There was an old lady there and I asked her to tell me something about it...if it was a barn or what it used to be. She said it had been...they grew oranges there, but there was something else... Anyway, she said that she didn't want to leave. I asked her if that meant she lived in it, and she said she did, and her son would give her food every day. I thought, "My golly, she's that emotional about this old barn." And so I started photographing them there, and I photographed four or five not-great photographs. But I had gotten into the idea of barns. And then when I came back here, I started looking around. There are all these barns falling down right here, and I didn't have to go to Spain to find them! So I started right down the road with the first one I came to. Then I got fascinated with them...they are so different, especially when you get over to Route 522 in Monmouth County. You go along there, between Freehold and Englishtown. I could see them way over in the background. Some had a "no trespassing" sign, but I'd just walk around the sign. I figured I wasn't "trespassing" but was just "walking around." I don't know if you saw any of those pictures, but there is one of a dairy farm. That's on Route 522, and that was particularly interesting because it had a big opening. I just got fascinated with the way they were built.    Once a lady cop came along with a gun. She asked what I was doing there when there was a sign up, and I told her I hadn't noticed the sign. I told her I was doing this project, and I had gotten a state grant to do this project. I showed her my credentials, and she told me it was all very nice but asked what would happen if I fell there. Who would come to rescue me? She told me I should let them know where I was going. So she was really very nice, and it was true that I could have fallen down or tripped or something. But anyway, along Route 522 there were three or four wonderful, old barns. And then I started branching out, but they're all within about fifty miles of Roosevelt. Some of them are in Ocean County, it's possible. Some of them are on the road to Route 537, which goes to Mount Holly. So along that road there are some. And then all along the road that goes to Freehold...well I have maps of every county. There is a map store on the other side of Princeton, and they have all the county maps. So I got a bunch of those maps and followed them.    Mr. Saretzky: These barn photographs are now at the New Jersey Museum of Agriculture.    Ms. Rosskam: Yes. The first time they were shown was in Philadelphia. It was a combination show of Edwin's and mine. They had one whole room of just the barns. Then they were shown somewhere near Mount Holly and in a bank. Then they were shown here in Roosevelt. They were shown quite a bit, and they were shown at the Peddie School. They have a very nice gallery there, and a lot of people came who lived around here. I got a phone call from these people that I never heard of. They said they had seen the pictures and wished I would come to their house. I asked where it was, and it was on a back road. They told me the name of the road but that the house was quite far back, and it was on the historical register. So I went back and met the old couple, and there they are in this wonderful old house with an old barn and everything. They were really a little bit upset. They didn't know what to do because they weren't allowed to change anything, and they couldn't take care of the whole house. They wanted to build a cottage at the back, and they couldn't because they weren't allowed. I was very sympathetic, but I didn't know what to say. I was glad to be able to photograph what they had, but they weren't glad about it. And they rented out their land to one of the Chinese farmers, so I felt really weird. I thought all this historical stuff was well and good, but what if somebody needed to change it. We ran into that in Venice. You can't change the outside of anything and they didn't want to stay in the house the way it was.    Mr. Saretzky: You can change the inside, but local laws often make you get approval to change the outside.    Ms. Rosskam: So that's the story of how I got involved in it. I got so involved in it, that I went barn crazy. I would just drive around and see sometimes just an old, wooden wall. And then I wanted to make it a campaign, to stop using up the agricultural land. And that's why I gave the photographs to the agriculture museum at Cook College. I thought they'd make a campaign, but they didn't.    Mr. Saretzky: It sounds like it was something that helped you deal with your grief.    Ms. Rosskam: Yes, it definitely was. By the time I started working on those barns, I was all ready to go. I did a lot of driving around. It was a lot of work. I wasn't doing my own printing then. We had a darkroom for awhile across the street, but I didn't have a darkroom anymore. So I got them printed, and that's not exactly "kosher." You really should be printing your own stuff.    Mr. Saretzky: You're excused.    Ms. Rosskam: I got some beautiful prints. Right now there are so many campaigns not to use the agricultural land, and it seems to me that they ought to set them up somewhere to get people to see what they're missing. Anyway, it doesn't matter. It's done. And then I started a whole new project after the barns went off to Cook College. I started photographing trees, which are fascinating because they are only good photographically when there are no leaves on them. So I have a whole set of those.    Mr. Saretzky: Louise, we've covered a lot of territory.    Ms. Rosskam: I know, too much.    Mr. Saretzky: No, it's been great. Is there anything that you would like me to ask you that I haven't asked you?    Ms. Rosskam: Let me see, I'm trying to think. The thing about it is, when you have kids you want to pass on something to them. Our older daughter studied photography for awhile in New York, but she had a very bad marriage and it broke up. She had to earn a living and he was an alcoholic. So she started to work on alcoholics' programs, and now she is head of a big organization down there. So she gave up doing photography, but she is always still doing it. See that picture there? She did a whole bunch of things like that.    Mr. Saretzky: That's your daughter in Virginia?    Ms. Rosskam: Yes. And then Anni, of course, she got the other side of Edwin. And that's why she gets so irritated because she thinks Edwin took over my life. And I never can convince her that that's not what happened. And she's a duplicate of her father...exactly. And her little boy...do you see the picture of him and Edwin? They are duplicates of each other. The only trouble is, the little boy is so involved in possessions. He watches that show "Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?" He called me up at ten o'clock last night and asked me if I saw it.    You know, Andre Kertesz was a friend of Edwin's. He took some photographs of Edwin and his first wife. They have been reproduced here and there, but we happen to have one that he took in Paris when Edwin had a studio there. It's just a small print and for awhile, Anni and her family were kind of up against it. They just won't let me give them money most of the time, unless I somehow or other get it to them without too much fuss. But they had this photograph, and it was reproduced in a magazine. Anni wondered what it was worth, and she took it into Sotheby's, and they said it was worth something like $14,000. Anni couldn't believe it was worth that much, so she left it there to be auctioned, but it didn't sell. So she has it back, and she said she is never leaving it out of her sight again! So things like that happen. It's interesting to see how these two girls develop in such opposite ways.    Mr. Saretzky: Louise, thank you very much for sharing all these memories with me and others in the future who will read your oral history.      
MonmouthCounty;Lorraine Ayres;1923;2000;Lorraine Ayres, 1923, 2000    Shrewsbury River, 1945  Date of Interview: March 20, 2000 Name of Interviewer: Flora Higgins Premises of Interview: Little Silver Public Library, Little Silver, NJ Birthdate of Subject: February 17, 1923  Ms. Higgins: Mrs. Ayres has been affiliated with the Little Silver Public Library since April 1961 and with the Holy Trinity Lutheran Church in Red Bank since 1945. Good afternoon, Lorraine.  Ms. Ayres: Hello.  Ms. Higgins: It is nice to be doing this at last!  Ms. Ayres: Yes. I'm not too familiar with life in Monmouth County before 1945, but I came to Monmouth County because of my husband. I met my husband-to-be in the Navy. We were stationed in Gainesville, Georgia. He proposed to me and I said, "Well, I won't say yes or no until I see where you live." So I came up to Red Bank on the train. I changed the trains in New York to come down to the Jersey Shore. Coming through what I saw made me think, "I don't want to spend the rest of my life here." But when we got to Red Bank, Bob took me around and took me to the ocean, which did not impress me because I had seen the Pacific Ocean, and when I saw the Atlantic Ocean with its rocks at Sea Bright, I was not interested. But we went out into the country, and it was lovely, and I decided maybe I could spend the rest of my life here. Before coming to be in the Navy, I was born and raised in Northern Minnesota on a farm. I taught school for a year in a country one-room school, and decided that was not my life. Actually my mother had said to me, when I taught school for a year, I could save my money and do whatever I wanted after that. I decided to join the Navy and become a WAVE, which is what I did.  Ms. Higgins: Was that unusual? Not many women were in the service at that time, isn't that true?  Ms. Ayres: It was getting to be more common, and I decided to join this one summer I was spending in Minneapolis. Over the Fourth of July there were parades and I saw women in uniform, I saw women who were WACs, but I did not like the brown uniform. When I saw WAVES, I thought that was much nicer, so I thought I would try to join the WAVES. Luckily, I did finally make it, even though my parents were not happy about it. But they did not stand in my way, so I came to New York to Hunter College, and from there to Georgia, and from there to Minneapolis, and from there back to Georgia and then finally to Red Bank. Red Bank in 1945 was very different than it is today. I can remember going into Red Bank to do some shopping and there was a store called Yankos, which had one of these contraptions with a person up on a second story who would send the money that you were purchasing something with in a little metal container. It would go up, and they'd get the change to come back to you. And the only food stores, of course, were different. There was an A & P on Broad Street in Red Bank and it was the kind that they wrapped the meat up in brown paper and used one of these long hooks to take things off the shelves. I was staying with my future in-laws and everybody had things delivered  the laundry man came, the bread man came, the milkman came. And during the summer, there would be a truck coming by with produce. And I even remember knife sharpeners would go up and down and call out to see if you needed your knives or scissors sharpened. I think the first year I was here my next-door neighbor, who had a friend was on the school board of Red Bank, asked if I would be a substitute teacher, so I did that. It was hard to get a substitute teacher then.  Ms. Higgins: What differences did you see between your teaching out West and your teaching in Red Bank?  Ms. Ayres: They were very much different. I think they needed substitute teachers over in West Red Bank, River Street, which even back then was predominately Black, and the grade that I remembered the most vividly was a sixth grade. The very first thing, when I was a substitute teacher there the first day, they said to me was, "Miss Bvelland, you have to read the Bible." I'd never heard of that in Minnesota. We never had any reading of the Bible. So they showed me the Bible in the teacher's desk and I read a psalm. I decided to read First Corinthian Thirteen because it has to do with charity, or love, and after that I found out that you should have only read from the Old Testament. That was something that was very different. The children were quite well behaved  I didn't have any problems, and it was a different kind of atmosphere. Back in Minnesota they were all farm children, but these were all city/town kids.  Ms. Higgins: But they're all the same age. Didn't you teach different ages all in one classroom?  Ms. Ayres: Yes. These were just all in one. During the summer, my husband played a lot of baseball and softball, and if I went to any of the games some of the children would come up and talk. They were friendly. But I decided that I wasn't going to become a substitute teacher. After we were married, we lived with my in-laws for four years because my mother-in-law told me that there was no housing available. There was nothing built during the War, and it had just started up maybe a couple of years after the War ended. The developers started buying up property and building houses.  Ms. Higgins: What year did you get married?  Ms. Ayres:1946.  Ms. Higgins: And so the Levittowns were just beginning then, probably?   Ms. Ayres: This Little Silver was practically all nurseries. And several of the developers bought up the land and started building houses. We were married in May of 1946. In May of 1947 our oldest son was born, and that was a different kind of lifestyle for me because my mother-in-law did all the cooking, and we sent the laundry out, and had a cleaning lady come in - so I mainly had just to take care of the baby and to go out with the girls.  Ms. Higgins: Did you know how lucky you were?  Ms. Ayres: Probably. But in those days, nobody worked. My husband had always lived in Red Bank in the house where we were living, and he had always been an athlete and had lots of friends, and so I was introduced to his friends and it became a cliquey kind of life. We all went out to the baseball games, and during the winter or whenever, we girls did something called the Hen Club - we got together. Everybody had children, except one girl, but the rest of us all had children, and we were all in the same category. I was not happy living with my mother-in-law, but she had said to me that there is nothing available, and Bob has always had a nice house, and it wouldn't be fair for him to live in some shack, so you better just be satisfied. However, when I became pregnant with the second child, she decided that maybe it would be time that we looked for something. I remember going one Sunday after church, driving around. My father-in-law was born and raised in Little Silver, so they knew what Little Silver was like. He said, "Don't buy any houses over in this section of town because the land is very low, and there'll be septic tanks, and it's not a good place to look for houses." At that time when Malmone was starting to build over in Queens drive and over in that section. But this one Sunday, we came through Rumson Road, and we found this new road that had just been cut through, and there were houses being built. So we came down this road, and there was this house, and there were workmen there, and we stopped, and I went in and I said, "Is this house for sale?" And Mr. Grandinetti said, "No, it isn't, but I'll build you one just like it across the street." He said that the lot had been sold earlier because it had a lovely huge tulip tree, but the people couldn't get a mortgage, so that lot was for sale again. We were pretty ignorant  we looked at the house that he was building and said, "Oh, that's nice, and we'll take one just like it."  Ms. Higgins: Is that North Lovett?  Ms. Ayres: Yes. My mother-in-law said, "Oh, okay, this is high ground, this is fine." He was a builder, an excellent builder, I don't think you could find many good houses like that built today. So we waited until Linda was born in June and we moved in June of 1950.  Ms. Higgins: That must have been very satisfying, having your own home.  Ms. Ayres: Yes, it was. In fact, my parents, who had moved to Oregon, had said to me, "We will never come and visit you unless you have your own home." So I had been married four years and had two children before they even met my husband. So then they came as soon as we had moved into our new house. Then life was good with two little children, with all the neighbors on the streets. Everybody had the children go outside. My kids still remember my saying to them, "Go outside and play." Three years old  "go outside and play." And they did.    Birthday party at 148 North Lovett Street, 1953  Ms. Higgins: Where did your children go to school?  Ms. Ayres: There was just the one, Markham Place School. When our oldest son started school, it was starting to get crowded because there were houses being built all around and they bought property, I guess, where the Point Road School is, and they tried to get a referendum to build, but it failed by eleven votes. That meant the children had to go on double sessions. So there was a year or two that our children went on double session. There were kids all over, and it was not a very good situation. Then finally the referendum passed, and Point Road School was built. During that time I was active in the PTA and did the usual thing that mothers do.   Ms. Higgins: Did you keep up with the Hen Club?  Ms. Ayres: Oh, yes. That kept up forever.  Ms. Higgins: You know there was a man I interviewed at the beginning of this project who was an old time Red Bank person and he also played a lot of softball. His name is George Jones  he'd be about the age of your husband, I think. But before the kids went to school, did you take up with any activities then? Were you still active in the church?  Ms. Ayres: Yes, I taught Sunday school, and I was active in women's groups in the church and that was about it. The Friends of the Library was formed here in Little Silver. I was active in that, because after we moved to Little Silver in 1950, right away I was looking for a library. Of course, at that time, the old Borough Hall had the library on the second floor. It consisted of, I think, entirely donated books. I don't think there was any budget to buy new books, or anything like that. It was adequate  I guess we didn't know any better. But there were new people coming in to Little Silver who wanted to have a better library and formed the Friends of the Library, and that became the impetus to start really getting a good library. I think that group was formed in 1959. So by 1960 they had hired Harriet Balkan as librarian. Then in 1961, they decided they needed an assistant and put an ad in the paper and I guess the newsletter, or something, and I decided that it might be a good job. Our oldest son was, I think, going to be in eighth grade, and I got thinking, "How are we going to afford college?" Our insurance man came over and he looked at our finances and he said, "There's one way that you will be able to afford college for your son." We said, "What is that?" He said, "You have to get a job." I thought, "Oh, no, I don't want to be a secretary, and I don't want to work in a store, and I don't want to work in a hospital or anything like that." So I think it was providence that put this ad in the paper for a librarian. I went over and I think there were about twenty or thirty applicants. The committee reviewed the applications and then they called two of us in for a final interview and Mrs. Balkan called and said that I had the job. The salary started at two dollars an hour, it was part-time, like nine hours a week. She said with my qualifications they were going to pay two seventy-five an hour. So that was fine. At that time my youngest was in kindergarten, and he was very good. After kindergarten he would come into the library to check in and see that everything was all right, and then he would go outside and play. So I started my career with nine hours.  Ms. Higgins: What did you do when you were in the Navy?  Ms. Ayres: It's rather interesting how I got in. I had applied during the school year, and I sent in my application, and they called me and said, "Go to Fargo, North Dakota for the physical." And my students were all excited about this, and then I got the letter saying that because of my eyesight and my height that I was rejected, and my students were very disappointed because they thought it would be wonderful to have their teacher in the Navy. So I decided I wasn't going to teach again. I gave my notice and at that time they had NYA in Duluth, Minnesota, and -  Ms. Higgins: What's NYA?  Ms. Ayres: It's National Youth Association, or something like that. It was one of those left over from the Depression. So I went to Duluth, and I took radio courses, but I came home for the Fourth of July, and was just going to be home for the weekend and go back, and then they announced that the government seized all funding for the NYA so the school was closed. I said, "Oh, what am I going to do?" I wasn't going to go teach, but this was 1943, the War was on, and I thought, "Oh, I can get a job somewhere." And then, I don't know how I found out, but my mother had gone to the mailbox and taken a letter I had gotten from the Navy saying that they really had changed their mind, that I could be accepted. She had burned the letter.  Ms. Higgins: On purpose?  Ms. Ayres: Yes, on purpose. And so when I was home, the second letter came and I got the mail and I said, "What?" And she admitted that the first letter did come and that she had burned it. So I took the letter. I had a cousin who lived in Minneapolis, and I decided I would go there and look for a job. So I got on the bus, and went to Minneapolis where my cousin picked me up. She was working for Pillsbury at the time, and had to go to work at eight o'clock in the morning, and I walked with her. I was going to buy a newspaper and look at the want ads. I said goodbye to her at the corner, and looked up, and there was the Navy recruiting station--right there! I walked in with my letter and went through the physical, and walked out, sworn in. I really had never had a train ride before, but they gave me money to go back, this was in July, and I think my day to go to Hunter College was the sixteenth of August. On the train I sat with a lady who said that her cousin was in the WAVES, and she was a link trainer instructor. And I said, "What is that?" She said, "Well, she has something to do with airplanes and she teaches pilots how to fly by instrument." And I thought, "That sounds wonderful, I like that!" So I got to Hunter College and we had to pass all of these tests to find out what you would be qualified for, and it seemed like most of the girls who had been secretaries or who had been working in the hospital or something, got those kind of jobs. What you did was what you were qualified for. But a couple of us, a good friend of mine and I decided that we would apply to be link trainer instructors. And we were called in by an officer for the interview. The two things that really got us into that field was we were farm girls and we knew how to work with machines, and both of us had been teachers in a country school. You had to know how to teach to be an instructor, so of course we impressed upon the officer that we were very good at that. We were picked. There were twelve of us, we went down to Atlanta, Georgia, to school, and that was the hardest I think I've ever worked. There were civilian men who were taking the course to be a flight simulation trainer instructor and they were very good with the written tests, but there were quite a few of them who flunked out on the mechanical. We had to take a link trainer apart and put it together, and some of the men could not do that. Anyway, we could and that was what I did. I spent all my Navy time - twenty-eight months...  Ms. Higgins: Training Navy fliers?  Ms. Ayres: Um hmm.   Ms. Higgins: Now, when you came to Little Silver, did you look back on those days and think that you were now working in a library and it was pretty quiet? Of course, that's a common question of all veterans. After the War, did life seem more tame, or were you glad it was over?  Ms. Ayres: No, I didn't have any bad experiences, and my husband-to-be got sent up to Cape Cod and never went overseas, so we didn't have any horrible experiences. It seemed to me glamorous. Actually we all keep in touch, those of us who are still living. These twelve girls, and some of the fellows that we met, are sort of a cliquey bunch. Of course, my husband was always involved in sports and I guess that's -  Ms. Higgins: Did your boys play Little League?  Ms. Ayres: Yes.  Ms. Higgins: Back in the 1950s was that a pretty new thing?  Ms. Ayres: Yes.  Ms. Higgins: So, did they go out and practice all the time? Did you feel it was too much, or not enough?  Ms. Ayres: It was one of those really, I would work until five o'clock, come home, and it would have to be a quick supper, and there'd be practice or a game at six o'clock and away everybody went. And that was the life style.  Ms. Higgins: Soccer mom! I'm trying to think back to Middletown, where I lived then, because the library experience was so much the same. The library was in the police department, in the basement, and I don't know if Middletown organized the 'Friends' the way Little Silver did. But the 'Friends' are still active in Little Silver and continue to work for the library.  Ms. Ayres: Well actually we always used to say  we should have called it the Ruth Branch library because there was a very active person in the 'Friends' whose name was Ruth Branch. She came from New York, and she was a New Yorker who had lots of get up and go, and then it was, I think, during the Johnson years, when there was money around and she'd get through all of this red tape, to get all the money, because as you know, this part was the first library after the old Borough Hall was demolished. This was the garage for the old Borough Hall and they spent about twenty five thousand dollars to make it into a library. It wasn't enough. The space became inadequate almost immediately.  Ms. Higgins: Was the first library about half this size?  Ms. Ayres: It was up until where you can see the first divider. And we had a lot of books and the circulation was fantastic. Nobody had television, what else was there to do?  Ms. Higgins: But Little Silver has always had the reputation of having a lot of very well educated people, and I think that was true back then.  Ms. Ayres: So, they decided that the library was too small, and there was this federal money out there, and Ruth Branch did all of this work. She got the money to build the extension, to buy the furniture, to buy the drapes, the shelving, and all of that.  Ms. Higgins: Was Ruth Branch ever the librarian here? Did she have any input into your affiliation with the County library system, was that always the arrangement?  Ms. Ayres: Yes, we were always affiliated with the County, and after we really got started in this first part of the library, the bookmobile came. I don't know how often, but that was a big to do when the bookmobile came, because usually Harriett would send me out and say, "Pick out the books that you want." And you'd pick out everything and put them in boxes and whoever was driving the bookmobile would bring them in and these would be our books for the next go around. Sometimes we would go into Freehold where they had this old building for more books. Then, after we got the big addition, we had all of these shelves and we didn't have enough books to fill them, so some of us went to the big green building and we just picked out a lot of books and started to fill our shelves.  Ms. Higgins: How did you know what to choose?  Ms. Ayres: Mainly by what the people in Little Silver liked. I mean, it was mysteries, fiction, history, and whatever else, cookbooks.  Ms. Higgins: Knitting books.  Ms. Ayres: Not so much now, maybe then.  Ms. Higgins: And how often did you rotate these books?  Ms. Ayres: I think we kept a lot of them for a long time.  Ms. Higgins: Okay, so they were old, right?  Ms. Ayres: Yes.  Ms. Higgins: I'm scheduled to interview the man who was one of the first bookmobile drivers for the system.  I'm eager to talk to him, because he went all over. He was saying that when he came around, it created a lot of excitement for the community. Little Silver was one of the first libraries in the system, wasn't it?  Ms. Ayres: Oh yes. And we did have some very interested, intelligent people who worked very hard to get the library.  Ms. Higgins: Who else were some of these people who were active?   Ms. Ayres: There was Patsy Ingram, there was Myrtle Borgeson, Alice Correa, Elise Jacobi, who is still living. In fact, her daughter-in-law is president of the Board of Trustees at the moment.  Ms. Higgins: The organization of the Little Silver library differs slightly from most libraries in the system. There are volunteer groups in some libraries, but I think Little Silver has maintained the most active volunteer group consistently over the years. Would you tell us a little bit about how that got formed and organized?  Ms. Ayres: Lynn Mack was another person who was very active, and even when we were upstairs in the old Borough Hall, somehow the 'Friends' decided that they wanted to become more involved than just coming to a meeting, so we had people who came in to jacket books, to do typing, to shelve books, and we had a very interesting woman who did story time for the children. Today, there's a children's librarian from the County who comes and does children's programs, but then it was a volunteer.  Ms. Higgins: Lorraine, who taught the people how to do these things with the books?  Ms. Ayres: What do you mean?  Ms. Higgins: Who taught them how to cover the books and organize and shelve them? Did you?  Ms. Ayres: Yes.  Ms. Higgins: Seems you haven't gotten far from being a teacher! What with the Navy experience and then teaching library volunteers here.  Ms. Ayres: That is still my job, to deal with the volunteers.  Ms. Higgins: And scheduling?  Ms. Ayres: Um hmm.  Ms. Higgins: They are an active part of the library.  Ms. Ayres: Very much. They are very, very active, and very necessary.  Ms. Higgins: I think that's a singular achievement, I really do. How do you see Little Silver being different in the year 2000 and from 1950? What are the major differences that come to mind?  Ms. Ayres: When we moved here in 1950, there were no supermarkets. There was a barber shop and there was something called a Sugar Bar which sold newspapers and ice cream, and things like that. There was a butcher shop, and I think there was a hardware store, but I'm not positive. And there was a river running through, which is now all covered up, but it used to have a little bridge and the children used to go and watch the fish swim. You can still see portions of it.  Ms. Higgins: Now of course you have stores.  Ms. Ayres: Stores and traffic. Unbelievable, terrible. And everything is built up  there are no vacant lots.  Ms. Higgins: That's too bad. Lots of senior housing in Little Silver, or -  Ms. Ayres: Um, yes, there's Cheshire Square, which is senior, and Alder Brook, which, I guess that could be senior -  Ms. Higgins: Is that down by the old Ski Haus?  Ms. Ayres: No, Alder Brook is over by Sickles. That's high class, three hundred seventy, three hundred eighty thousand dollar condos. And then there are other developments that are not senior.  Ms. Higgins: Can you think of any famous people from Little Silver that you might have known, or may know? Tell us about Sickles.  Ms. Ayres: Sickles?  Ms. Higgins: Yes, I used to buy at Sickles, and then I was convinced to buy at Laurino. And there seems to be a singular rivalry between Laurino and Sickles. Why is Sickles corn the best?  Ms. Ayres: Well, Sickles has been here as long as I can remember and they have become high class, high priced, I suppose and have everything because it started out as just a little farm market and then it became bigger, and when this Parker died, and they were relatives, and the land is now gone.  Ms. Higgins: It's no longer being farmed?  Ms. Ayres: There's nothing. There are maybe a few fruit trees, but everything that they get comes from other places.  Ms. Higgins: Then he's not selling his own produce as he did.  Ms. Ayres: Maybe some fruit, but nothing - they may rent or do something out into other fields, but not here. So that's all. And there were a few other places in the beginning that people had gardened and sold stuff, but not anymore.  Ms. Higgins: Were the Ayres some of the original settlers in Little Silver?  Ms. Ayres: My husband's father, yes. They lived in a house on Prospect Avenue and they are buried in Embury Methodist Cemetery. My father-in-law married Hazel Rogers, and that was how he came from Little Silver to Red Bank.  Ms. Higgins: I see. Was there much interaction between Little Silver and Fair Haven and Rumson?  Ms. Ayres: No. I think a reason could be that Red Bank had a high school from way, way back. In fact my mother-in-law and my father-in-law both graduated from Red Bank High School. That was a long time ago. And Rumson and Fair Haven did not have a high school. I don't know where they went. Holmdel children came to Red Bank until Holmdel built their own high school.  Ms. Higgins: Where did Little Silver students go?  Ms. Ayres: They always went to Red Bank. Well, way back, way, way back, some of them could go to Long Branch High School. In fact my father-in-law went one or two years to Long Branch High School and then transferred to Red Bank.  Ms. Higgins: What were some of the ways you as a family would amuse yourselves during the 1940s and 1950s?  Ms. Ayres: When our first child was born, the trains came through Red Bank and they were the old fashioned locomotives. He loved the train, so every night he and his father would go to watch the train come in. And there was a newsstand right by the train station, and Bobby used to get a comic book, or a Golden Book almost every night after watching these trains. We went to movies -  Ms. Higgins: Where?  Ms. Ayres: Carlton Theater.  Ms. Higgins: Which is now the Count Basie.  Ms. Ayres: Right. And there was the other one, on Broad Street, the Strand, which had second-class films.  Ms. Higgins: I never heard of the Strand in Red Bank, that's something. And did you go out to dinner?  Ms. Ayres: There was a restaurant in Little Silver, The Farmhouse Restaurant, only it wasn't called that then, it was called The Roosevelt Tea Room.  Ms. Higgins: Why Roosevelt?  Ms. Ayres: I think because that was the name of the women who ran it. I'm not sure, I'd have to look in the book of Little Silver history. They made very good homemade cakes. To go out to eat was not a very common thing.  Ms. Higgins: Several people in the County have commented on the change in the weather  do you notice the change in the weather?  Ms. Ayres: Yes. Much more snow back then, blizzards, and I think the year 1946 was supposed to be a really bad year.  Ms. Higgins: Also a lot more ice-skating.  Ms. Ayres: Yes.  Ms. Higgins: Did your boys have to clear off the pond and all with their shovels before they skated?  Ms. Ayres: They were not skaters.  Ms. Higgins: There's water around here, but of course a lot of it is salt water, which doesn't freeze.  Ms. Ayres: Right. My husband had a sailboat when he was a teenager, but my boys never got that interested.  Ms. Higgins: Was that at the Monmouth Boat Club, that old one in Red Bank?  Ms. Ayres: Yes.  Ms. Higgins: Sailing is big on the river. Lorraine, were you content with the education your children received? Did they go on to college?  Ms. Ayres: Yes. Actually, as the insurance man said, I had to pay for their education, and all three of them graduated from college and all three have Masters degrees, and one has a PhD. They all did very well.  Ms. Higgins: And all on two seventy-five an hour.  Ms. Ayres: That's right. And the interesting thing was that when my husband retired from the government in 1973, he was making the most money he ever did, that was twelve thousand dollars a year.  Ms. Higgins: He worked for the government? Where?  Ms. Ayres: He was a machinist at Fort Monmouth.  Ms. Higgins: Oh, Fort Monmouth, yes. Was he at Fort Monmouth during the troubles in the fifties?  Ms. Ayres: Yes.  Ms. Higgins: Would you care to venture an opinion on that?  Ms. Ayres: Well, to go back to when my husband graduated from high school, he was not academically interested. In fact, he tried to flunk out so he could go another year so he could play basketball, but that didn't work. He got a job driving a truck for a dry cleaners, and my mother-in-law was not very happy, so she met somebody who worked at Fort Monmouth and somehow she got my husband into the machine shop at Fort Monmouth. He seemed to like that pretty much, and in fact he was one of the last ones to be drafted, because they did not want to let go of what he was doing. They thought it was necessary for the War effort. But he did finally say, "I'm finally going to go, everybody else is going, so I'm going." So he did. But his job was waiting for him when he got back, when he got out of the service. So he worked all the time, and it was a bad thing that he didn't have a degree, because he did all of the work and those who had the degree got the honors and the salary.  Ms. Higgins: But he must have been there during the McCarthy era.  Ms. Ayres: Yes. You couldn't go and visit, and he never said anything about what he was working on. One of our neighbors also worked there, and he had to be demoted or whatever. He didn't work for the government anymore.  Ms. Higgins: The more I'm talking to people, the more I realize what an economic factor Fort Monmouth has been in Monmouth County.  Ms. Ayres: Well it was very much. I just wonder now how people make seventy to eighty thousand dollars a year and can't make it  how did we ever manage?  Ms. Higgins: If you had several things you could be empowered to say to people in this new century, as Little Silver, and, in fact Monmouth County and the world grows and develops, what would you like to say to them, the people who will be reading this archive? Any advice?  Ms. Ayres: No. I was fortunate I could stay home with my children until the youngest was five, when I went to work. I can see how hard it is, because my daughter has had to go back to work since her child was a baby, and it's just the difference in lifestyle or whatever.  Ms. Higgins: The times. In remarks to your whole life, Lorraine, what would you say about that, your life here?  Ms. Ayres: I am very happy that I've been here, I have lots of friends, and a very good church relationship. We did a lot of traveling, so I've never felt cut off from my family who was out West.  Ms. Higgins: And you and your husband continue to enjoy good health.  Ms. Ayres: He's still working every day. He carried over with his talents as a machinist and he works for antique dealers, doing repairs on all kinds of things that nobody else can do. And he likes it very much.  Ms. Higgins: And two of your children are both here, and one is out West. Is that correct?  Ms. Ayres: Yes.  Ms. Higgins: But you do go back and forth?  Ms. Ayres: Yes.  Ms. Higgins: Your ethnic heritage is -  Ms. Ayres: Norwegian.  Ms. Higgins: And have you been to Norway?  Ms. Ayres: Yes.  Ms. Higgins: Do you want to talk about that?  Ms. Ayres: I went in 1990 and liked it very much. I did go with a group of Lutherans and we toured from Bergen to Oslo, and then we went to Sweden and to Denmark, and then we went to Germany. I would like to go again.  Ms. Higgins: That sounds like a nice trip  I would like to go myself. Lorraine, please comment on the reading tastes of the public. Do you see any changes in literature in the thirty years you've been working here?  Ms. Ayres: Not really. The people are looking for pleasure reading, mainly. The children are looking for pleasure reading, except for when they have reports to do. I have noticed that there are still a number of young mothers who are home with their little toddlers, and they come in and take out lots of library books. I would say the majority are not young teenage mothers, these are more mature mothers. Of course, now that we have videos, too.   Ms. Higgins: We circulate a lot of videos, too. A lot. Can you recall what you were doing when you heard when Franklin Roosevelt had died, or when President Kennedy had been shot?  Ms. Ayres: It was very interesting when President Roosevelt died. He died in Georgia, and I was stationed in Georgia then, and the train went right by the Naval Air Station, and we stood by and watched the train go by, and I think many of us were crying. We felt very sad and the train went very slowly through the town. When President Kennedy died, I was doing dishes. It was a Friday, and I heard it on the radio, and for some reason, I went to work, which seemed like sort of a strange thing, and nobody came in the library except for this one woman who was very sharp spoken. She said, "How come there's nobody here?" and I said, "President Kennedy died." And she said, "Don't tell me that blankety-blank Johnson is going to be our president now."  Ms. Higgins: What do feel you still want to accomplish? You've accomplished a lot.  Ms. Ayres: I have no idea.  Ms. Higgins: Have you ever thought of publishing your journals?  Ms. Ayres: I would like to, probably in the future, be able to talk into something and have a vocal record. Because the one journal I would really like to have done is the one I started when I was in high school.  Ms. Higgins: Lorraine, we'd be most pleased to lend you this equipment, and you could talk into that. That would be something we could talk about later. I am going to conclude this interview for now  unless you have any other things you'd like to say. Are there any locations in Monmouth County, Little Silver or wherever, that have any particular significance for you.  Ms. Ayres: Yes, the old Tennent cemetery. My mother-in-law's family has a plot there, and it was bought in perpetuity, and she was telling us when her mother died, during the flu epidemic in World War I, they went to the cemetery with a horse, and taking the casket. She said it was quite a drive from Red Bank to Tennent, and she said that they went to the cemetery and her mother was buried there. Then afterwards they stopped at the American Hotel in Freehold and got a meal.  Ms. Higgins: Have you been to Freehold lately?  Ms. Ayres: Yes.  Ms. Higgins: Lovely town, isn't it? Coming right along. Some people think that what's happening in Red Bank is wonderful, and some people think it's terrible. What's your opinion?  Ms. Ayres: I think it's good.  Ms. Higgins: I do, too. And Prown's is always there, and you can always get what you want at Prown's. Woolworth is gone.  Ms. Ayres: I miss some of the things that were here when I first came here. There was something called Lerner's that sold cheaper clothes, and Newberry's, and Woolworths. All of those stores had everything.  Ms. Higgins: Well, Lorraine, thank you very much.  Ms. Ayres: You're welcome.      
MonmouthCounty;Lew Williams;1927;2000;Lew Williams, 1927, 2000        Remembering The 20th Century: An Oral History of Monmouth County    Date of Interview:  January 13, 2000  Name of Interviewer: Connie Paul  Premises of Interview: Lew's home in Kerrville, Texas  Birth date of subject:  March 31, 1927      Ms. Paul: Ms. Williams, you really were born and raised in Texas. How does it happen that you came to Monmouth County, and when was that?  Williams4.jpg (47504 bytes)	  In 1994 Bill and Lew Williams moved from Freehold Township back to Texas.  They are shown the day before leaving at the site of the tie capsule buried as part of the Tricentennial celebration.  The capsule is buried adjacent to the fountain, in back of the Freehold Township Municipal Building.        Ms. Williams: We came to Monmouth County in 1970. Bill changed jobs and became associated with Triangle Publications. And we were part of that group of people moving into the developments being made around Freehold Township. Eventually, we surrounded Freehold Borough. We moved into an area called Stonehurst West, an area that had been potato farms, we were told.  The farmers were from Long Island.  We lived in Freehold Township until 1994.  We were there to see lots of changes and to see the difference that those of us, moving from other parts of the country, some from states far away, and some very close to New Jersey, made in the lives of those who had always lived in Monmouth.    Ms. Paul: What had the two of you done before that brought you there?    Ms. Williams: We had both worked on newspapers.  We met and married while working on The Waco Tribune Herald, a daily newspaper in Waco, Texas.  I was the night news editor, and Bill was the composing room foreman. Our son, William, was born there, and was three and a half when we moved to New Jersey.  Before moving to New Jersey, we had a slight stop over in Colorado and could see Pike's Peak through our living room window.  The land in New Jersey was flat and our house wasn't completely built.  I thought it was a disaster.  But it turned out to be a good move.    Ms. Paul: What did you do when you moved to Freehold?    Ms. Williams: Well, the very first thing we did was go to the First United Methodist Church because we were Methodists and that's what you did. So, the first Sunday, we went to church. One of the first things I said was, "If you're going to live in a place, you better know something about it."  So, when I saw in the paper a notice about the Battleground Historical Society meeting.  I took William in the car, and we went out to find a place called Tennent Church, where they were going to have their meeting.  I wanted to be able to find it at night by locating it in the daytime first.  I had heard a member of the Society talk at a small group who said, "Come to this meeting if you can," so I did, and remained with that group for many, many years.  I became the secretary, which was the first elected position I had in Monmouth County.    Ms. Paul:   Was that organization the first organized for the preservation of the Battle of Monmouth?    Ms. Williams: That was the thrust of it -- the reason it was started. It was all of Manalapan and Freehold Township in that area. But the thrust of it was to save the Battlefield, and to publicize the Battlefield.  It was an interesting group, and I met many people. And, that is where I began to meet some of the finest ladies in New Jersey.    Ms. Paul: Who are some of the people you met there?    Ms. Williams: Lydia Wikoff, Lattia Burke, Mary Kyle, Edna Netter, Evelyn Harrod, and I remember Jane and Henry Zdancewic -- she was the treasurer forever.  There was also Mary Evans, Ed King Jr., Fred Sanders, Helen Scofidi, and don't forget Charlie Wikoff and Fred Gray      Ms. Paul: So the group started out to protect the Battlefield.  Was it going into private hands?    Ms. Williams: It could have gone into development of more housing, and our group was instrumental in getting the legislature to save the land, and then after it was designated park land, we took a further interest in it. You know there's a visitor's center in the area.  I don't know how much of influence we had on getting it there, but a lot of time was given to it.    Ms. Paul: Did that become a federal park or a state park?    Ms. Williams: A state park.    Ms. Paul: And very popular to this day.    Ms. Williams: Yes.  The Battle of Monmouth reenactment had nothing directly tied to The Battleground Historical Society other than the fact that if the park hadn't been saved, they wouldn't have that popular event.  Remember in 1978, the 200th anniversary of the Battle of Monmouth?  I was so excited when I learned that we lived only a few miles from where this battle was fought, a battle I had never heard about, growing up in Texas.    Ms. Paul: Had you heard of Molly Pitcher? Or had you heard about General Washington on his white horse? So that was one of your first activities. And from that group, where did you branch into from there?    Ms. Williams: In 1973, I was appointed to the Freehold Township Board of Education, and served on that school board for about eleven years.    Ms. Paul: How did you get appointed to that?  WilliamsC.jpg (62622 bytes)	  Photograph taken in 1971 when Lew Williams returned home after being a hostess at a Battleground Historical Society tour of homes.  Lew joined the Historical Society shortly after moving to Freehold Township in 1970 and early on had a colonial dress and bonnet made.  The dress was loaned to a participant in a Battle of Monmouth parade and it never reappeared!  Husband William H. (Bill) Williams doesn't seem very impressed and his clothing certainly does not speak of colonial times.         Ms. Williams: Another woman who was on the school board moved. Marshall Erickson, who was the school superintendent, attended the Methodist Church.    Ms. Paul: And he knew you from there?    Ms. Williams: Yes.  And the school board president also went to the Methodist Church.  This is one of the funniest stories that ever happened to me.  One night I said to a friend, Carol Deneck, "Guess who is going to be appointed to the school board?" And she said, "Who?  Who's going to be the token woman?"  And I pointed to myself and said, "Guess who?"  And she fell over with laughter, and so did I. Because this was probably one of the reasons I was appointed.    Ms. Paul: Was there a history of having one woman on the Township Board?    Ms. Williams: Well, she had been the first one.    Ms. Paul: I see.    Ms. Williams: I stayed on the board long enough to become vice president and the first woman president of The Township Board of Education.    Ms. Paul: What were some of the most important things that happened during that time?    Ms. Williams: Well, building schools to keep up with the growing population.  The school boards which came before me and those who came after, particularly those who came before, built enough schools so that there were never double sessions in Freehold Township.  There was always a school ready when that extra group of children arrived.  We had to do some redistricting, but we were never without a school to put children in.  I came on when the schools were in good shape. We only built one school after I was on the board.    Ms. Paul: Which school was that?    Ms. Williams: The Applegate School. The most important thing the board did while I was there was hiring a successor to Marshall Erickson.  Marshall had been there many years and was well respected in the community and school.  We hired David Cole to be the Superintendent.  The process of searching and selecting was the most important thing ever done by that board, in my opinion.  We had to pick a person who could follow a long-timer and who would fit in with the Assistant Superintendent.  The succession did run smoothly because of their compatible personalities. But we could have hired the wrong person, then they could have been at cross purposes and we would have had a whole different system.    Ms. Paul: How long did Dr. Cole remain as Superintendent in Freehold Township?    Ms. Williams: Until his retirement two or three years ago.    Ms. Paul: Who were some of the other people who served with you on the board?    Ms. Williams: Harry Post, Carol Deneck, Jeannine Willis, John McCullough, Walter Cable, Dr. Lou Barth, Jane Bentley, and Lou Goselin.    Ms. Paul: I met you when you joined Hope Lutheran Church a number of years ago, but I had already known your name from the Freehold Area American Association of University Women, which you were involved in. Tell me about your involvement in that organization.    Ms. Williams: I joined the AAUW about 1972, at the urging of Jean Carlson, who also went to the Methodist Church.  She talked about what a good group it was.  I thought it sounded like it would be interesting.  I went to a meeting at the Donovan School and met some really neat people.  One of them being Carol Deneck, and some other nice people.  I joined and before I ever went to a real meeting, Carol Deneck, who was going to be the president, called and asked me if I would do public relations.  If you've ever worked on a newspaper, when you join a group, they automatically think you will do the public relations -- the news releases and all that stuff.  She called and asked me if I would come to a board meeting at her house.  I became a board member as Public Relations Chair.  When we moved in 1994, I was still doing the publicity for the branch, although I had also served as vice president and as president.    Ms. Paul: AAUW is a 100 year old organization meant to develop further educational opportunities for women.  What are some of the things you are proudest of in your association with that group?    Ms. Williams: Being able to raise enough money to give scholarships to women returning to college seeking a higher degree or seeking a degree. We started a used book sale and my husband, Bill, had access to a lot of books. And, we inundated the place with those books year after year. We moved the book sale around because it was hard to find it a house.  We went from the racetrack, to a storefront, to a church, to a school. We just had to move it around as we didn't have a permanent place, but we always had a lot of books.  People began to look forward to it and we made a good bit of money. And some of us who were involved with it from the very beginning had such a good time and worked so hard. One night we had sorted books until we were dead. And this truck came up with a load of books and just dumped them out.  They were from the penitentiary in northern New Jersey.  We could never bring ourselves to say no to a load of books, but there were times we really wished we had.  I was really proud of the book sale and the proudest moment in my AAUW life was the night they announced that the scholarship would be named for Lew Williams.  I think that was probably more because of Bill than me, but I'll take the credit.    Ms. Paul: Why not? I know you worked long and hard for that organization as well as so many others.    Ms. Williams: There are people still there working on the book sale who were working on it in the beginning.  Leila Sulkes and Joan Odud might have been there the first year if not, very close to that. They are younger than I am, but they're still around, still in New Jersey, still doing the book sale. And it's probably easier than it was then. Lila used to let us store all those books in her garage. We stored a lot in my basement.  It was really tough to take them up and down. And then we stored a lot at Bill's newspaper, The Daily Racing Form.  And then we brought them over to Freehold just before the sale.    Ms. Paul: What was Stonehurst West like when you moved in? You said it was one of the first developments, or maybe it was the first development in Freehold Township.    Ms. Williams: There were still lots and lots of trees around our house and the whole row of houses between our street and the next street had a real stand of trees between us.  During the time we were there, we lost a lot of trees in storms and things like that, but when we left there were still lots of trees.  As we moved in all the houses weren't finished, even on Kettle Creek Road, which was our street. But, the developer of Stonehurst West sold the property behind us to Levitt, and Levitt came in and leveled trees to put up his houses.  He planted new trees, but it wasn't the same. I can remember how quickly those houses went up.  Of course, when we first got there, the house was barely finished, and the yard wasn't finished, and there were piles of debris in the front yard. And I thought, "And to think I exchanged Pike's Peak for this."  Mounds of building junk and stuff, but it got moved, and we put down some sod that happened to be given to us.  So we had grass pretty soon.  People were all from "somewhere else" -- many from apartments in the city.  The area was not overly friendly and Oldimeds thought it was a "ritz" area -- it wasn't really.    Ms. Paul: After William went to Freehold Township Schools, where did he go?    Ms. Williams: The Peddie School in Hightstown.    Ms. Paul: Was Bill active in Freehold Township politics during most of that time?    Ms. Williams: During a lot of that time. Most of Bill's community involvement was with Freehold Area Hospital.  One day, he came home from the office early.  I was reading the local newspaper, The Colonial News, and it said, "There is going to be a meeting of people who are trying to build a hospital on Thursday night at the First Presbyterian Church."  My comment to him was, "Do you mean we have moved to a place where there is no hospital and we have a three and a half year old child?"  And he said, "Well, I guess so."  So, Bill went to that meeting.  They were trying to raise money, and he agreed to canvas our immediate neighborhood, and then he asked his boss, Walter Annenberg, for a donation.  When Bill went to the next meeting, he had quite a sizable donation for the hospital.  Those people who had been working for years raising money welcomed him with open arms and he was involved with the hospital from that night until the day we left.  He went all the way through all the offices, to president of the hospital board and the president of other boards that had formed in the hospital family.  It was really a labor of love for him.  He spent a lot of hours out there, went to a lot of hospital events, and did a lot of fundraising for the hospital.  He was the first non-Freehold native or long-time resident to be chairman of the Charity Ball -- he was chairman in 1973.  We hadn't been there very long, and I was down in Texas during the summer with our son visiting our parents.  I came home and Bill had been to the Charity Ball and said they were going to make him vice-vhair. They were going to put him on the learning curve to be the chairman. Then, I found out the learning curve was very sharp, because he was the president the next year.  We took the theme of, "It's your hospital, Charlie Brown."  You know how Charlie Brown always hears, "It's your dog, Charlie Brown"?  All his friends said to him, "It's your dog, Charlie Brown." Well, we took that theme and said, "It's your hospital, Manalapan.  It's your hospital, Englishtown.  It's your hospital, Freehold. It's your hospital to all the places around."  Friends and I cut out a jillion Snoopy and other Peanuts characters, like Charlie Brown, Lucy, Linus, and hung them on fishing lines across the Freehold Raceway.  The Raceway donated the building for the ball.  The Charity Ball was the biggest money maker for the hospital at that time, but the place where you did the betting was like a long alley.  In fact, when Davis and the Nashville Brass came to play, he said, "It's the only time I can remember playing in a tunnel."  We had a great turnout the night of Bill's ball, and it raised more money than it had up until that time for quite a few years. Since then, it has become a much more elegant fancy affair. But then, it was a ball and an auction and maybe pretty rustic, but the Charity Balls made the money that bought the land where the hospital sits today.  WilliamsB.jpg (75179 bytes)	  From 1970 until 1994 William H. (Bill) Williams was involved in Freehold Area CentraState Hospital work.  His first major involvement was taking on the chairmanship of the 1973 annual Charity Ball.  Adopting the theme from the "Charlie Brown" of the Peanuts cartoon strip, the ball told the entire Freehold area it was their hospital with signs of It's Your Hospital, Freehold  It's Your Hospital, Manalapan  It's Your Hospital Marlboro etc.  With Williams in front of a monstrous Snoopy is his wife, Lew (far right) and Marie Rodriquez of Manalapan, who earned the title of Charity Ball Queen by raising the most money in the Queen contest.         Ms. Paul: It was called Freehold Area Hospital in the beginning wasn't it, and then it became CentraState Medical Center?    Ms. Williams: Right.  It was Freehold Area Hospital for a lot of years. And then, I guess as a kind of continuation of the theme "It's your hospital," it was a hospital for more people than just the Freehold area.  I was really involved in that name change.  More people buy into CentraState.  At the time, you think they won't, but they do if you change the name of the building.    Ms. Paul:   How did you get involved in the Freehold Tricentennial Celebration?    Ms. Williams: Bill was mayor, and the city manager, Fred Young, was a good friend of ours.  He heard me talking about a job I was doing for another organization. And, he said, "Why don't you do this?"  So, between the two of them, they kind of talked me into being the coordinator for the Tricentennial Celebration.  The Committee and the City Manager were all very supportive, and they let us do some interesting things.    Ms. Paul: Tell me about Freehold Township being 300 years old before we talk about the interesting things that you did. I think most people think of the township as the johnny-come-lately around Freehold Borough.  And yet it wasn't really like that, was it?  WilliamsDa.jpg (12823 bytes)	Freehold Township celebrated its 300th birthday in 1993.  This was the logo for the year-long celebration.      Ms. Williams: No, it wasn't.  Freehold Township was developed. Farmers moved there or settlers moved to the area that is Freehold Township and were living there before the town or the borough was established. At the time of the Battle of Monmouth, there were about forty houses in Englishtown and about forty houses in Freehold. But that included those that were out in farm sites too. It was a prosperous area, I'm told.  The land was good. They could grow things.    Ms. Paul: And so, what kinds of things did you decide would be fitting to celebrate a 300 year old history?    Ms. Williams: The very first thing we did in January when the township committee took office, as it always does in January.  I had colonial clothes made for them, including the tri-cornered hats.  I even managed to scrounge up two of the long white wigs, and when the township committee and the township officials came into the room that night for the meeting, they were all dressed in their vests, their pants, their knee stockings, their tri-cornered hats, and it kind of set the tone for the year. The next month, we had them dress up in those outfits again and go down to the Covenhoven House, which is on the edge of the borough.  (Laughs)  And they cooked some stuff because the lady down there leads cooking demonstrations for school kids.  She showed our mayor and committeemen how food was prepared 300 years ago, and they all fooled around with the cooking. It made a good picture and good TV spots.  So, we did various things all year, and then on October 31, 1993, which was our actual birth date, the actual date on the charter, we had a parade.  And we had worked so hard on that parade, and we had so much in it. And, it was a cold, wet, terrible day.  Those of us who were there saw a great parade led by the Old Guard from Washington, D.C.  We had first seen the Old Guard in the Bicentennial Parade in downtown Freehold in 1976.  We called that The Battle of Monmouth Parade every year. And mercy, it was a good parade, and that was such an effective Fife and Drum Corps.  So, we invited them back, and I thought we had no chance to get them, but we did. We got them for our Tricentennial Parade, and we had bands, we had floats, and marchers from everywhere. Too bad it rained on our parade.  EllenWilliams.jpg (90691 bytes)	  Photograph taken during the Tricentennial birthday party in September, 1993, in Turkey Swamp Park.  At left is Lew Williams, Tricentennial Coordinator.  In Center is Barbara Fatovic, a member of the planning committee.         Ms. Paul: You had a big party out at Liberty Oak too, didn't you?    Ms. Williams: We had a late summer birthday party, so big it took two days.  We had the fair with activities and games and regular fair type events, with food and stuff. And the day ended with a performance of the New Jersey Symphony,  along with fireworks, and then we repeated it on Sunday night with the New Jersey Pops and fireworks that closed out that night.  It was fun. I remember it because I had a broken ankle that I didn't tell anybody about, that I was walking on during those days. Went to get the cast on it the Monday after the party.    Ms. Paul:   You and Bill decided to come back to your roots, and you bought a newspaper in Kerrville, Texas and moved.  What year was that?    Ms. Williams: 1994.  Bill came in late 1993, and I stayed in New Jersey and got the house ready to sell, and said some long good-byes and left in mid 1994.  We had bought a weekly paper in Kerrville, and we were really fortunate.  The place is pretty, and it is a small town, and we like it.  But we also found that it is actually harder to run a weekly paper than it is a daily. Now, we had lots of experience with daily papers.  But after about three weeks, we said "To heck with this. Let's really retire."  So we did, to an extent. We sold the paper.    Ms. Paul: And now the two of you seem to be as involved in Kerrville activities and politics as you were in Freehold, but looking back on those years in Freehold Township, what changes stand out in your mind?    Ms. Williams: The growth, and the covering up of the beautiful land with houses.  They're needed, obviously for the economy, but it is so sad to see productive land covered up with houses. I have this theory that the good Lord is going to look down some day and say, "Well, they've covered all the land that will grow anything with houses and pavement," and he is going to say, "That's it."  It's the growth that I remember, and Freehold Township changed from a place with a small town feeling.  Freehold Township was never very united as a town, because there is no central town place.  The Borough, of course, feels like a town, but not the Township.  So you made your family-type feelings with the church, or like us, with the hospital, and then with the Township Committee and the things we were doing with it and the other groups you belonged to.  But, even the feeling that was the beginning began to go away because it was very hard to meld all those people who came from so many different areas because there was never one place for them all to get together. And in the Township, you have seven schools, and not everybody is at the same place every time, and it was the change and the feeling of it just being a busy place.    Ms. Paul: You said that you were asked to run the Tricentennial because you were doing another project at that time that Fred Young had heard about. What was that?    Ms. Williams: I had been working for the Battleground Arts Center, an organization that was designed to bring performances to Freehold both for adults and for youngsters. In our program, we didn't have a theatre. We used Freehold Township High School. We used it for children's performances, and we used any place we could find, most often the Reform Church, for sometimes excellent programs that we got from all sorts of places: New York, and Philadelphia, and the audience came mostly from the retirement villages around. But, I worked for that for two or three years, and felt like it was a tremendous ideal, but it was an uphill battle to get funding.  But I had a good time doing it, and learned about and met a whole new group of people, and that was nice.    Ms. Paul: When was that organization started?    Ms. Williams: It must have started in the mid 1980s.  Carroll Dicker had been the first executive director.  I also knew her in AAUW.  You run into the same people.  And, when Carroll left to take another job, two of my friends from the AAUW, Jean Carlson and Sue Craig, talked me into taking that job.  There were a lot of times when I didn't know where the paycheck for the help was coming from that week, and I thought, "Why did I say yes?"    Ms. Paul: Where was your office then?    Ms. Williams: The office then was above Ben Alfred's Corner on Main and South Street. We had the upstairs office there. And then they were going to raise the rent, and goodness we couldn't afford that, so we went across and then we were above that shoe store on Main Street, not Al's Bootery, but a children's shoe store. It became many other things, but you entered right next to the café on the corner.    Ms. Paul: This is in Freehold Borough?    Ms. Williams: In Freehold Borough. Both places were in the Borough. That was a soft spot in the heart for the Borough. It was a neat place.    Ms. Paul: You were also involved in the Freehold Area Habitat for Humanity in the Borough as well, right?    Ms. Williams: Yes.  One more "You do the public relations."  But I also went to a lot of the board meetings. And I went to that first board meeting because I wanted to go somewhere where I could do something and see the results, like driving a nail and seeing a house.  I went to an organizational meeting and left there to do the publicity, and never got a hammer in my hands.  I always regretted that.  But, I took a lot of pictures and wrote stories.    Ms. Paul: And you were on the board for a number of years, right?    Ms. Williams: Right.  I had been working before that volunteering at the Open Door. And I was the Monday lady along with Anne Smith for a lot of years. She and I kept it open when it was on Throckmorton, and again when we moved around on South Street.    Ms. Paul: What is Open Door?    Ms. Williams: Open Door was an organization founded and sponsored by the churches. Many of the churches in town provided assistance to people who needed it, and we started to help people find out where to go to get help. That was the purpose. It evolved into a place where we gave away clothing, food, arranged some transportation, and occasionally, we could arrange emergency shelter in hotels, along with utilities, rent, and stuff.  We never had a lot of cash, but the churches donated to us.  There were times of the year when we had plenty of food to give away. There were other times when the cupboard was almost bare.  But we always had plenty of clothes, because as the minister of the Lutheran Church in the borough once said, "People clean out their closets, and give away their clothes, and they think they've done something.  Clothes they're not going to wear anymore, and they think they've done something."  I can't count the number of hours and the effort put into sorting clothes and throwing away stuff people give you  they think the poor will wear anything. That's not true. They won't.    Ms. Paul: I know that clothing storage became a big problem, and Open Door eventually went out of the clothing part of it, but it maintains an active food pantry, and also an active school tutoring program that's gone on there for a number of years.    Ms. Williams: That's marvelous. We talked about stopping doing the clothing, and then we would look at the number of people who would come in, particularly for children's clothing. And then we had people who came year after year because I was there long enough to see children of people that I had helped before come in. But then, there were people who came because it was a place where they could go and feel like they could look around  and because it was a place where they could go. So then, you would run into people saying, "Well, we've helped this many people this week, do we dare shut it down?" And if you reject somebody's offer of clothing, what does that make you look like? So, we would accept anything, and then spend hours going through it. Many times we were brought the estate -- whatever was left in somebody's home, they dumped in boxes and brought to us.  My sister and I give joke gifts at Christmas, and I have found her many presents at Open Door, including one of those fur pieces that had the nose and the little feet all left on it. That was a real treasure we could give away  and I did give it away to my sister.    Ms. Paul: Some poor person really did not need a fox to wear around the neck.    Ms. Williams: That's right.    Ms. Paul: So in all of those organizations, the only paid position you held was for Battleground Arts Center?  Was everything else volunteer?    Ms. Williams: Well, when William was a senior, that would have been in 1984, Art Schreiber had the paper -- he had made a great success out of The Colonial News and then he sold it -- and he had in his contract a non-compete clause.  As soon as it ended, he asked if I would help him start a weekly newspaper, and I remember saying, "Art, do you have enough money to do this?" And he said yes. Well, the advertisers you had before don't come back just because you say you are starting a newspaper. We had a good time, and all of a sudden, it was interesting that I could -- I'd been writing news stories all the years, but I could write a headline and lay out a page now. And it was nice to know that you could still do that.    Ms. Paul: What was the name of that paper?    Ms. Williams: The Colonial Free Press.  It had news in it, but it didn't last very long. And then I went from that paper to the Battleground Arts Center. I had stayed at home with Will until he was a senior, and made him do a lot of volunteer things with me.  We took food to the crotchety little lady toward Lakewood, who, when we got there would say "There's somebody under my house," or "They threw rocks at my house and broke my windows."    Ms. Paul: Was this for Meals on Wheels?    Ms. Williams: No, that was for Open Door when she called and she needed help.     Ms. Paul: Oh, I see.    Ms. Williams: So, I'd make him go with me, and we'd take food to her.  That's not a bad idea. Kids need to know there's more than one way to live, and not everyone lives in a house on Kettle Creek Rd. Some need food somewhere.    Ms. Paul: We've covered a lot of the organizations you were involved with.  Talk about Hope Lutheran Church, that you and Bill had joined.    Ms. Williams: We came in about 1976. We went to the Methodist Church about five years and one Sunday five families of us showed up at Hope Lutheran Church. We had known the pastor, Al Gibson, socially, and we also felt like it was the most alive church in Freehold. And I can now understand, much better than I did then, that the mainstream churches along Main Street were overwhelmed with newcomers from everywhere. And if newcomers come in, they want changes, and we were dangerous to them. We could do the work, but don't step on how we do things. Bill was named lay leader there, and I was president of Methodist Women, and then all of a sudden, it got to the point where we needed to do something else, and Al Gibson's church sure looked alive, so we all went out there. And then Al had a meeting with us at our house, about "What are they doing to me?" And we told him how we felt and then he went to see the minister and said, "I didn't ask them to come! They came on their own!" But we never went back, all of us. And the interesting thing to me is that some person, sometimes both persons, out of those families, wound up serving on the Church Council, and had big roles in what happened at Hope Lutheran Church, during the time we were there.    Ms. Paul:  You also got involved in public relations, and publicity, and writing the history of Hope Lutheran Church for the twenty-fifth anniversary and a number of other things.    Ms. Williams: A funny, funny thing happened.  Margaret Rosen asked me to be on the Altar Committee. In the Methodist Church there's no such thing as an Altar Committee. I said okay, so I went one time with her at the church to do what you do to take care of the altar. Then she left, or something, and Sandy Sproat who was also the committee, announced that I was the vice-chair because I was so well trained! And I had been there once! It was interesting and we were never sorry for a minute for having left and come out there.  It was an interesting move and a good move for us.    Ms. Paul: When you think of Monmouth County in general, what do you think of now from the perspective of living in Texas?    Ms. Williams: Well, it's really sad to say, but when I think about our last trip there which was last December, 1998, the traffic was overwhelming. And they didn't seem to be doing anything to alleviate it. There was still no train. There was still no decision to get a train. They had been talking about that when we lived there. Nobody is finding an answer to the traffic and it's just getting worse. And when I think about Monmouth, I loved where we lived in the Township, and it's still a pretty street, but I really think about that road to Colts Neck, in the beginning when it was just horse farms.    Ms. Paul: Highway 537?    Ms. Williams: Yes. Horse farms and land, and to drive over there, which we did in 1998, and saw much of that land covered up was sad. I tell people here "New Jersey's prettier than you think. You just think about the Turnpike. And that's not true. It's really pretty." But I have to gulp a little now, when I tell them, "And it's more rural than you think," because I think it's losing the rural feeling. And I'm sure that people would look at me right now and say, "But there's still a lot of land down here," and there may be, but it sure is getting crowded and full of traffic.    Ms. Paul: And so here you are in less crowded, more rural, Kerrville, Texas.    Ms. Williams: Right. If anybody has to wait through a light twice here, the next time you see them, they say, "Did you see that traffic jam today? I had to wait through that light twice!" We're growing too, and I already see changes here. There are enough houses on the building plan out in the surrounding area that will be covering up our land and our rural feeling. It's just that thus far, we have so much more of it. But Monmouth County was stable. I always felt like it had a stable government. Freehold Township had excellent leadership with the city manager. It had good people elected to the township committee, too, but the city manager led it on a nice path and kept the growth. You can't stop growth, but you can control it.    Ms. Paul: That was Fred Jahn.    Ms. Williams: Yes, Fred Jahn.    Ms. Paul: There are a great many people in Freehold Township and Monmouth County who remember with gratitude all the contributions you made to life there. This has been delightful, and thank you very much.    Ms. Williams: Thank you.  
MonmouthCounty;Lawrence M. Lawson;1947;2000;Lawrence M. Lawson, 1947, 2000        Remembering the 20th Century: An Oral History of Monmouth County      The Honorable Lawrence M. Lawson  Date of Interview: January 9, 1999  Name of Interviewer: June West  Premises of Interview:  Birthdate of Subject: April 17, 1947    Ms. West:  Judge Lawson, thank you for becoming a participant in out project.  Where and when were you born?    Judge Lawson: I was born in Neptune Township on April 17, 1947.    Ms. West: What made you decide to study law?    Judge Lawson: In my senior year at Bowie State University, I had an art professor, Dr. Stallins, who  worked with the Fraternity of which I was a member. He was the liaison between the Administration and the Omega Psi Phi Fraternity.  There were a number of law school recruits who came to Bowie State University and he asked me to go over and speak to them. I didn't want to go, but he really impressed upon me that I should go and take a look. So I went to talk with them, and I became interested. As a result of that conversation, I filed the application, took the law school aptitude exam, and was accepted into "Council in Legal Education Program," (CLEO). The CLEO Program was a program for minority students to prepare them for law school. I went out to the University  of Iowa after graduating from Bowie State  College (now Bowie State University) for six weeks. As a result of successfully completing the program, I entered Catholic University, Columbus School of Law with a three-year scholarship.    Ms. West: And where was Catholic University located?    Judge Lawson: In Washington, DC.    Ms. West: Besides this man, are there any other persons who have been a great influence upon your life?    Judge Lawson: My father. My uncle. Mr. Keith DeLuca who was my biology teacher in high school who later became the principal in Neptune High School for several years. They all inspired me to stay in school and get an education. And it was Mr. DeLuca who advised me to, "get something between my earlobes," because there's going to come a time when people are going to stop cheering and I should have something to fall back on.    Ms. West: Is there any comment that you would like to make to them today that you might have left unsaid?    Judge Lawson: I can not say enough to my father for everything that he did for me. My father had a third grade education but he was going to make sure that his son went farther than he did. My father would always tell me to reach for the moon and if I grabbed a star along the way then I would be a success. My uncle was also very strong in my life. He started me working at the age of thirteen. In the summertime, he never let me sleep until eleven and twelve o'clock, he had me out doing things. I can't thank him enough for all that he has done. Mr. DeLuca is still a friend. He still inspires me and gives me words of encouragement.  I would say "thank you" again to Mr. Stallins for inspiring me to sit there and talk to those law school recruits, but he has since died.     Ms. West: After you graduated from law school, what happened next?    Judge Lawson: I returned to Monmouth County. There was one other person who was a great inspiration in my life. That was the late Honorable Thomas L. Yaccarino. When I was growing up--and this story has appeared in various newspapers so it is true--when I was  three years old my mother would go to George's Market on Springwood Avenue in Asbury Park  Judge Yaccarino was working there while he was preparing for the bar exam. When my mother asked him what it was he was doing, he said, "I am preparing for the bar exam." My mother said, "I hope my son can grow up to be a lawyer," and he made the statement then, that if he could ever be in the position to help me that he would. Well, lo and behold, when I returned from law school my mother asked me what was I going to do, I told her I didn't know. She told me to go down and see Judge Yaccarino, who was then a District Court Judge. I knocked on the door and went in  I asked him did he remember me, and he replied, yes, I was little Larry, Alice's son. He told me he was going to be elevated shortly, and he had not selected a law clerk, but if he became County Court Judge he could have a law clerk. So, when he was elevated to a County Court Judgeship that August, he called me and asked me if I had a job. I told him no  I started working for him as a law clerk in September of 1972. I did not know it at that time, but later I found out that I was the first African-American law clerk to ever work in the court house in Freehold.    Ms. West: So that was the first job that you had after graduating?    Judge Lawson: Yes, ma'am.    Ms. West: Tell us something about your judiciary experience from there.    Judge Lawson: Well, after clerking for one year for Judge Yaccarino, I went to work for the State for a year. I worked for the Department of Community Affairs, State Office of Legal Services and worked my way up to becoming the Acting Director. After working for the State for one year, I opened my law office in the City at Asbury Park, in September of 1974 for the general practice of law. I practiced in the City of Asbury Park for twelve years. I was primarily known as a criminal defense attorney, but I did a little bit of everything, except for bankruptcies. I became involved in politics, and in 1980 I went to the Democratic Convention in New York as a delegate for Ted Kennedy. Then, in 1984 I went to the Democratic Convention in San Francisco as a Walter Mondale delegate. I was the Municipal Prosecutor for the City of Asbury Park and the Board of Adjustment Attorney for the Township of Neptune. I became involved in politics locally. In January of 1983, I ran for a committee seat and won. In January of 1984, I became the Mayor of Neptune Township.    Ms. West: Why did you become involved in politics?    Judge Lawson: I always had a knack for interacting with people and an interest in becoming involved in politics. I admired the late John F. Kennedy.  I was a junior in high school when he was assassinated. Judge Yaccarino had been involved in Neptune politics for many years before becoming a judge, so the year that I was with him, I heard all about the politics of Neptune. During that time I also wanted to become a judge. I realized in 1972, when I worked for Judge Yaccarino, that there had never been a Black judge in Monmouth County, and I was told then that the only way that I could become a judge was to become involved in politics. After my clerkship, I became an active member, working in the Democratic party. I worked my way up through the ranks of the party.     Ms. West: Who appointed you or nominated you to be a judge in Monmouth County?    Judge Lawson: It was Governor Tom Kean, a Republican. There is an unwritten rule in this state that there is an equal number of Republican and Democratic judges sitting. .    Ms. West: Before becoming an Assignment Judge, what other courts or divisions did you work in?    Judge Lawson: I was assigned first to the Civil Division because the late Chief Justice Robert N. Wilentz felt that minorities never get a chance to sit in the Civil Division. For some reason, the few minority judges (seventeen to be exact, including myself) always were assigned to criminal or family, so I was assigned to civil. However, after spending six weeks in the Civil Division, Judge Milberg, the then Assignment Judge, asked me would I be willing to go to criminal. And of course, I said yes, because that was my forte. So I was assigned to the Criminal Division as a trial judge. I was a trial judge in criminal from March until September, and on September 1, became the Presiding Judge of the Criminal Division. I became the first African American to become a presiding judge of a division in the court system. I served as Presiding Judge of the Criminal Division for three years, and then I was assigned to the Civil Division. I sat in civil for a year doing medical malpractice cases, and then I was reassigned back to the Criminal Division where I was a criminal trial judge for two years. I was then appointed as Assignment Judge by the late Chief Justice Robert N. Wilentz.     Ms. West: What year were you appointed to the Assignment Judge?    Judge Lawson: April 15, 1993. I remember because it was tax day.    Ms. West: Okay, that's a good reason to remember. Let's get back to being mayor of Neptune. What aspirations did you have when you assumed the office?    Judge Lawson: I wanted to be one of the best mayors that Neptune had ever had. I did not want a mayorship that would be tainted with any corruption. There were a number of minority mayors being elected in the country. I wanted to distinguish myself as being a great mayor.     Ms. West: You were the first and, to date, the only Black mayor of Neptune Township?    Judge Lawson: Yes, ma'am.    Ms. West: Well, now being the first Black mayor of Neptune Township, the first Black judge to the Superior Court, and the first Black assignment judge, what significance does this hold with you?    Judge Lawson: It makes me very humble. A lot of people laid down their lives in the struggle and the battle for me to be where I am.     Ms. West: How did your parents feel, noting the success that you have attained and were attaining?    Judge Lawson: My parents were overjoyed. My father was worried the night that I ran for township committee.  I had never lost at anything other than not passing the bar exam the first time around. But everything else that I had attempted to attain I was successful, so he was very concerned as to how I would take defeat, if I was defeated that night. Luckily I wasn't defeated. He was elated. I'll never forget it. I was thinking of my father because the anniversary of his death was Sunday, November 7. I was thinking, how he wouldn't call me Larry. When I was the mayor, he called me "Mr. Mayor " as a judge, he would call me "Judge." He was just delighted at my success in those positions. My mother is my biggest cheerleader now. I don't have to worry about anyone not knowing who I am, because whenever I am with her, she says, "My son the Judge." She is very delighted and happy about my achievements.    Ms. West: Did you ever have any siblings?    Judge Lawson: No, I am the only child.    Ms. West: You're married?    Judge Lawson: Yes I'm married and have a twenty-one year old daughter. Our daughter wants to be a lawyer, also.    Ms. West: She's going to follow in her daddy's footsteps. That must make you feel very good.    Judge Lawson: Yes, it does. As a matter of fact, I was talking to her Sunday night about doing her applications and sending them off to the various law schools that she is looking at for next year.    Ms. West: Aside from your job with the judiciary and all, what other things have you done for the community or communities?    Judge Lawson: A judge's life is somewhat limited because we can't be involved in a lot of activities. But I participated in midnight basketball  two years ago. I was coaching a basketball team from eleven o'clock at night to about three o'clock in the morning hoping to keep young people off the street. I mentored students at Second Baptist Church when Reverend Vernon Matthews had a mentoring program. We had a men's program at United Fellowship that I worked with and I speak at various organizations around the county wherever I am asked to address young people, trying to get them active and motivated to further their education and stay in school.    Ms. West: Could you tell me what newspaper headlines might have had the most profound effect upon you?    Judge Lawson: The death of Martin Luther King.    Ms. West: How did that affect you?    Judge Lawson: Knowing what the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King was trying to do for all mankind, not just for Black people, but for our entire society. And to see that he was stricken by an assassin's bullet, that we have such people in this country that are still so caught up in violence and negativism. It really made me aware of what this country was all about at the young age of twenty-one. I was in my junior year of college at Bowie State University. Dr. King's assassination made me realize how important his movement was, and what we, as the Black people, had to do to forge ahead in this country.    Ms. West: What was the climate in Neptune at that time?    Judge Lawson: The climate in Neptune, I believe, was very passive. In 1970, though, we had the riots.    Ms. West: Well then, with all that behind you, when you became the Mayor of Neptune, did you feel that maybe somehow you could make a difference with the attitudes and the way people were thinking? Making them more aware of a community, not just for Blacks but for all?    Judge Lawson: I tried to bring everyone together  to make it clear that it wasn't a Black Neptune or a White Neptune. I didn't want anyone to look at me as being a Black mayor but a Mayor who happened to be Black for all people. I tried to bring cohesiveness, and bring Blacks and Whites together in Neptune. However, there is a soft spot for minority children, and I've tried to convince them that they have to get an education.     Ms. West: Do you notice a difference between then and now?    Judge Lawson: Unfortunately, no. In fact, I think we have taken a step back. I think Neptune and I think all the communities around here have regressed. I think things are worse than what they had been back in the 1980s. And I think that has happened because we have become complacent.     Ms. West: What about the county?    Judge Lawson: The county is growing. Monmouth County is the fastest growing county in this state. We have over 600,000 citizens in Monmouth County, but as far as minorities going forward in this county, there's a lot more that needs to be done.     Ms. West: Cosmetically speaking, or visually speaking, has there been much of a change in Monmouth County since you were a youngster?    Judge Lawson: Oh, yes. There is much change. It's built up, the housing populations have increased, but for some reason, it seems as though when I was a kid, there was more of a "neighborhood" atmosphere among the people. I can remember block parties. I can remember mixed neighborhoods. Now you look around and you can spot the Black neighborhood, you can spot the Italian neighborhood. I think we're becoming a lot more independent in this county. There is a lot more that can be done.    Ms. West: So you're saying everybody seems to be so polarized now?    Judge Lawson: Yes, that's the right word. There is polarization in this county.    Ms. West: Well, as the busy person that you are, do you have any hobbies, or anything that you do for recreation?    Judge Lawson:  I'm an avid Giants football fan. I've had season tickets since 1972. I play golf, and I attend athletic functions.    Ms. West: Tiger Woods fan?    Judge Lawson: Tiger Woods fan.    Ms. West: Other than going to sporting events, do you have a specific hobby or anything?    Judge Lawson: Yes. Miniature trains.    Ms. West: What gauge is that?    Judge Lawson: Lionel.    Ms. West: Oh, twenty-seven gauge.    Judge Lawson: Twenty-seven gauge! You got it!    Ms. West: What would you say is your greatest achievement?    Judge Lawson: My greatest achievement is becoming the Assignment Judge in Monmouth County.    Ms. West: What is the most unusual thing about yourself?    Judge Lawson: When they hear that I'm the Assignment Judge, a lot of people always look for someone older. I guess the unusual fact of the matter about me is that I'm fifty-two years old. When someone says he's the Assignment Judge, people look for someone in his sixties. People always say, "You're not the Assignment Judge." So I would say that's one of the unique things about me. And I still like to have fun. I enjoy my job. Everyday, I get up I look forward to going to work, and I have a smile on my face. I always want to see what I can tackle that day. I enjoy my work and I enjoy what I do. So I guess that's probably another one of the unique things about me. However, once I get into that courtroom I'm a different person. People say that's not the same Larry Lawson that's in chambers, or maybe at home. When you're in the courtroom, you're very conservative, you're old-fashioned, you're very solemn, and you're a no-nonsense person. But once you come off the bench and take that robe off, then hey, you're just a regular everyday person, and I try to be that way. When someone comes to me and asks me who I am, or is what my name, I say, "My name is Larry Lawson," and they'll say, "Oh you're the Judge." I was Larry Lawson first and Judge second, so that's the way I always like to look at myself.    Ms. West: You're so content with your employment and everything. Is there anything you can think of that you would like to do next? Anything else that you would like to accomplish?    Judge Lawson: No, I have no other aspirations. I have been fortunate that everything that I have sought to achieve I have. I am fortunate to have a good wife and a great daughter. I have achieved success in my profession, so I've been very blessed, and there's nothing else that I desire.    Ms. West: So you're satisfied with your life as it is right now.     Judge Lawson: Yes, I am.    Ms. West: Is being a Judge the epitome of all your youthful aspirations?    Judge Lawson: Yes.    Ms. West: What advice would you give young people today?      Judge Lawrence M. Lawson speaks with Ayanya Snelling, a senior at Asbury Park High School, February 2000  Judge Lawson: I would tell young people to get an education, stay in school, listen to your teachers, definitely learn how to use a computer, and be humble. Read a lot, and learn as much as you can. A "Michael Jordan," a "Walter Payton," a "Jim Brown" are born every three seconds. You have to be very fortunate and in the right place to become a star, or an athlete, or a singer, or a movie star, but once you get that education no one can take that from you.    Ms. West: What troubles you about the state of the world today?    Judge Lawson: All of the crime and use of guns by young people, drugs, and racism have me deeply disturbed. I'm glad I grew up when I did. I'm glad that my daughter is grown. I really feel sorry for young people and I worry about my daughter when she has a family. What type of world are they going to grow up in? The world as I knew it as a child is no longer there and those things bother me. Every time you pick up the newspaper, someone has shot someone, someone has killed someone, kids are taking guns to school, bombs, threats, school closings.     Ms. West: What are your deepest values?    Judge Lawson:  God, my family, and my church are my deepest values.    Ms. West: And what are your strengths?    Judge Lawson: Someone said it to me yesterday that my strength is in communication. Talking to people, being a good listener, and trying to make sure everyone is treated with civility, dignity, and with respect, and trying to treat them with the same.    Ms. West: Now everybody's talking about the Millennium. What are your milestones or do you have any as far as the Millennium is concerned?    Judge Lawson: My only milestone is to see that my daughter graduates from college and hopefully graduates from law school. That's my biggest goal right now, my number one goal.    Ms. West: How would you describe your life if it was a road map: how would it be-- straight, zig zag, up and down?    Judge Lawson: I would say it would be up and down. I've had adversities. I try to relate to defendants that everyone will make a mistake. But, you have to benefit by your mistakes and make your life better.     Ms. West: This may not be a fair question, but I'm just going to ask you anyway. As you were born and raised here in the township, many people have known you all of your life. How do you feel they perceive you?    Judge Lawson: I think they perceive me as being one of them. They don't think that I've gotten too big for myself. They know that I'm reachable. They come to my door, they call me on the telephone, they see me at church. They ask me about their cases. They call me in chambers and I talk to them on the telephone. They see me at the mall, and they stop and talk to me, they see me at the restaurant.  I never look at myself as being above them. I always want them to remember me and I always try to remember from whence I came, because it's very easy to be knocked down. It's very hard to get to the top. And I could not be where I am if it wasn't for people in the community to support me. A number of times when I'm riding down the street, someone will blow a horn at me, and my wife asks me, "Do you know who that is?" I say, "No." "Well, why'd you blow back?" Well, it could be somebody that I know, and I don't want anybody to say, "Oh, look at him, he can't answer me back or blow back because he thinks he's all that." I don't want anybody to ever think that.    Ms. West: Well, see then again, there are a lot of people who will know a person in your position and know who you are, so it's just the matter of courtesy.    Judge Lawson: Matter of courtesy. It's amazing how people will stop by my house and say, "I've got jury duty, can you get me out of it?"  or ask me questions about the law, or tell me their problems or something going on in their family. But I never try to put myself above them. I always remember from whence I came.    Ms. West: Well now speaking of people wanting to get out of jury duty, do you ever try to explain to them that it's a privilege to serve on the jury?    Judge Lawson: I do. I tell them that if you have a criminal record you can't, and it's one of your obligations as a citizen to sit on the jury. A lot of people have died fighting for the right to have Blacks sit on a jury. If there is a minority who has been selected for the grand jury, I try to make them the fore person or the deputy fore person so they would feel a part of the system in the process. When I was trying cases, it used to really bother me the number of times I would try cases and I wouldn't see any minorities on the jury. You hope that you get the right group of individuals.  But you don't see that many jurors now. In the past, we took jurors from voter registration lists and from driver licenses. Now we take jurors if they apply for a home state rebate, if they apply for an income tax return, or if they get a interest statement. Now there's three more areas for us to poll them from, so I do see more Blacks coming in, but it's still not enough. The jurors answer a questionnaire. I get a questionnaire every week from all the jurors because I want to know exactly how were doing. I'll usually see a couple of them asking how come there aren't more minorities participating in the jury process? We have whites who are concerned that there aren't more minorities in the process.    Ms. West: Do your peers feel the same way?    Judge Lawson: Yes. They feel the same way.     Ms. West: Is there anything else you would want to say?    Judge Lawson: I feel very blessed and fortunate to have had parents who were very supportive and to have a wife and daughter who are supportive of me. But I'm also grateful for the people from the community who have been very supportive. Even on my ups and on my downs, they have been there. They have never abandoned me.  I feel very proud that I don't have to go any place where I feel worried that something is going to happen to me. If my wife or my daughter or my mother goes some place, someone will always know them, and know who they are, and they'll look out for them. So I feel very blessed about that and very happy.    Ms. West: Well, I thank you for talking to me this evening. It's really been my pleasure. You don't know how much.    Judge Lawson: My pleasure. Well thank you.    Ms. West: It's been a while since I've seen you. I wouldn't even say how many years, I can't even count them, but when I was invited to be on the Planning Committee the Remembering the 20th Century project, you and Tommy Smith were the first people who popped into my mind. I said, "I'm going to grab them before anybody else does!" So again, I thank you for letting me talk with you.    Judge Lawson:  Assemblyman Smith was another person who was very influential. We talked about how cohesive the community was when I grew up. When I was a young boy, Assemblyman Smith was a police office in Asbury Park. I lived in Neptune, but my father and my mother knew the Smiths and if he saw me in the street, he would chastise me if I was doing something wrong, and he would tell me to get on my way, and when he saw my father, he told him also!  I knew if I went home and told my father that Officer Smith had to say something to me I'd be in real big trouble, and I'm going to get a beating at home.    Ms. West: Well, I guess that's sad, but true.    
MonmouthCounty;Kenneth Mount;1935;1999;Kenneth Mount, 1935, 1999        Remembering The 20th Century: An Oral History of Monmouth County    Date of Interview:  July 22, 1999  Name of Interviewer:  Emily Bershad  Premises of Interview:  Mr. Mount's home, Freehold, NJ  Birth date of subject:  October 12, 1935       Ms. Bershad:  How long have you lived in Monmouth County, and what do you know about your ancestors?    Mr. Mount: Well, I have lived in Monmouth for sixty-three years, and my ancestors,...strange, I never saw but one of my grandparents. Two were in an automobile accident where Van's is now, and they both died as a result of that accident. My grandfather on my father's side owned a bakery on Throckmorton Street, which was Mount's Bakery. Now, I never saw this man  then Carl Steinburg came across all these old movies of Freehold borough, and the surrounding area township and all that.    Ms. Bershad When was that old movie found?    Mr. Mount:  I guess about three or four years now.  I watched that film, and that was the first time I ever saw my grandfather. He was  at the bakery.    Ms. Bershad: Is the film available, I mean, do you know where it would be?    Mr. Mount: I would imagine if you went to Carl Steinburg you could get a copy of it. They were selling them at the American Hotel when they first came out for I think fifteen dollars or something I like that. Somewhere around the house I had one.  If I had it available, I would just give it to you.  You're talking about a lot of back history.  That would be a film to watch.    Ms. Bershad: I will tell them at the Library, the people who are doing this history of Monmouth County, they probably would be interested. So, if they went to the American Hotel they could find it?  Is Carl Steinberg in the phone book?    Mr. Mount: Yes, he owns the furniture store on Throckmorton Street.    Ms. Bershad: Oh, yes, okay, yes I know. Okay, so you were saying that your grandfather had a store and sold what?    Mr. Mount: It was a bakery.    Ms. Bershad: And where was it?    Mr. Mount: On Throckmorton Street, back where the Conley's Lodge, that is an Elks Club now. That used to be the bakery.  On my mother's side of the family, most of them were employed by the Rug Mill. One uncle was a manager over there, and then I had another uncle, Ralph, who was in the dye room. He would make dye for the rugs. I had an opportunity to work there for one year when I was fifteen years old. Not too much more about the family, except like I said, I have just seen one grandparent, and that was my father's mother, Annie.    Ms. Bershad:  What places in Monmouth County have personal significance for you other than Freehold and why?     Mr. Mount: I always liked Asbury Park. When I was young, my parents would take me  there and that was a real treat. And it is a shame to see how the businesses are going down and all that, right now. It was too bad the economy went the way it did.  I have been here all my life and seen a lot of changes, but one that sticks out is Asbury Park.  It went from really being something to just a dreary place, you know?    Ms. Bershad: How is your life different now than you thought it would be, when you graduated from high school? Is it different than you thought it would be? Have you gone a different way than you really intended to originally?    Mr. Mount: Yes.  I didn't actually have that opportunity to graduate from high school.  I wound up getting a general GED.  But, when I was in high school, my plans were that I was going to be a priest.  And, actually my whole life changed when my father died at a young age.  I was the only one home and I actually took care of the family.  In fact, back then we had the draft, and I had gone for my physical and I was going to be drafted before they found out that I was the head of the family, I went to 3A they called it. It was exempt, you know.      We did not hear of air conditioning. TV was almost unknown. A lot of changes in my lifetime  I never expected to be married and have five children. And it seems just like yesterday when I was in school.    Ms. Bershad:  When did you first go into law enforcement?    Mr. Mount: Back in 1970, I took the police test with my brother. And at that time, I really wasn't that interested. I had always wanted to get into police enforcement, but it was with the State Police, and I took the test, I believe three times, and I finally passed it and went for my physical, and I was turned down because I didn't have enough teeth. Back then, you had to have a certain number of teeth. I had a molar pulled out the day before, and you had to have two molars. They were strict back then for the qualifications. That was back, when I was around twenty-one, twenty-two.  Then when I hit the thirties, I took the Freehold Borough's test, I had a choice: I could go into the Township or with the Borough. But being I was Borough boy, I went with the Borough. And I have been in it every since.    Ms. Bershad:  How long has Freehold Township had their own Police Department?     Mr. Mount: When I first started back in 1970, I believe they had about four police officers. The chief was Chief Narozick. His family lives here in the township over off Robertsville Road. At that time, we had State Police up in Tennent.  There was a barracks up there. There was a barracks in Wall Township, and the State Police would work with the Township with whatever they had, and if they needed something, the  Borough would always help them. I remember the Chief Wills, he was just a patrolman when I started, and there were a couple of others. They were full-time, but it wasn't a big police department you know the way it is today. Everybody assisted each other back in those days. But we mostly depended on the State Police in this area.    Ms. Bershad:  Have there been any major changes in the Borough's Police Department since you have been working there?    Mr. Mount: Back in 1970, The Borough's Police Department was over the top of the Fire House, and we moved from there over to Hudson Street into the school. There is going to be another change coming up pretty soon. I think that is going to be when they move from there over to the Rug Mill, because it seems like that might happen. When I first went on, I believe there were maybe fifteen police officers, and it has doubled since then. It is roughly about twenty-seven or twenty-eight now.  It is better training. When I went to Police School, we had our training  at the County Jail.  Now I have to say, police officers today seem to know more than what we knew when we went out.  When I first started, I was given a uniform and a gun, and I carried that. I started in March of 1970, and graduated from Police School in November, so you figure for three or four months, I didn't have any training at all. But today that is unheard of. Today, before you put your uniform on, you have to go to school. There is better training, and I feel, more equipment today.    Ms. Bershad: Yes, I agree. I would like to contrast the way medicine is practiced today in this area, and they way it was when you were growing up. I know that we did not have Freehold Area Hospital out on Route 537, of course, in those days. Could you tell me a little about it?    Mr. Mount:  There was no hospital. It was unheard of. And I don't even remember when Jersey Shore or Long Branch came into being where they are now. My family for some reason, I don't know, would deal with Trenton, Saint Francis Hospital. That is where I was born. And as far as medicine goes, I know two brothers that were born right in the house on Court Street. There was no hospital to go to. I remember Dr. Lewlis coming to the house. In fact, I can remember when one of my brothers had whooping cough. He almost died on account of that  it was a bad disease.  A lot of drug stores are now like CVS and Revco, which was here for awhile.  The big change I have seen is the drug stores. Lenny Barbish, Abe Elin, he used to have Wood's Pharmacy. When I was a child, once a month we would all go down and get Castor's Oil.  Have you ever had any?    Ms. Bershad: Oh, sure!    Mr. Mount: And that was given to us by the pharmacist. As far as medicine goes, you just went to the doctor when you were sick, and there was no six months checkup, or anything like that. And I believe even the women when they were pregnant, just stayed until they had to go and have the child, you know? Compared to today, I wouldn't want to go back to where I was in those days. I would take the medicine in the medical field that they have today. It is a big success around here. It is a big town now, and look at the size of the CentraState. It's nice to have that close by and plus, First Aid. They were around but not, I mean they just had a couple of members then. I can remember the time whenever there was a First Aid call, you'd hear a siren go off, that is how they were notified. Because there were no pagers back then. Everything is new today. So, the changes are good changes.    Ms. Bershad: Yes, I agree. There is much more availability for medicine and the medical practice than there used to be.  I wanted to ask you a few things about restaurants, of course, they have changed a great deal.  When I was a kid I used to be able to bring my dog into a restaurant.  But now, of course, you cannot do it, everything is changed.  How about the restaurants in Freehold Borough?  Were there many, and what were they?    Mr. Mount: The biggest restaurant was the American Hotel  it was operated by Mr. Datener. It was a family restaurant  you could go in there and you had a big menu to choose from.  You had the small restaurants. There used to be on where Stefanos Pizza Restaurant is. There used to be a bar and a restaurant inside.  That was the fast food in those days. You could go in there and get a sandwich and food like that.  Conway's Bar was over by Sagarretson's.  I don't think they served food in there.  And Van's, as far as I can remember, has always been there. That is always an excellent restaurant. I can remember some years ago, you could get a double lobster dinner for something like six or seven dollars.  Today,  they're worth thirty-five dollars.  Then, Max's, Route 9, is a boarded up building now.  That was a big hamburger place.  It was like a McDonald's back then. And right where the Ford place is, there's a gas station just before it.  That used to be a big road stand  McCormick, I believe owned it, and you could go in there and get hamburgers, hot dogs, and buy the fresh fruit and all the things they had there.  They were the big places back then.  Moore's was always there, but that wasn't a restaurant.  And that was the end of it,  because Route 9 wasn't built up.  There were no such things as Hardee's, McDonald's, or any of those restaurants.    Ms. Bershad: I understand that during Prohibition, Van's was a speakeasy.    Mr. Mount: I went in there a few times with my father. They had a bar right downstairs. I believe they still have it. I don't know if they took it away. And, I remember they used to have horses in the back of Van's. James Cartwright owned it. Always had the peacocks on the side of the house. I am trying to think. I couldn't have been more than maybe eight or nine years old. But, I do remember going in there, and it should still be in the cellar.    Ms. Bershad: I would think so. Prohibition was in the 1930s. What major changes have you seen in this area of Monmouth County in your lifetime?    Mr. Mount: When I was young, living on Court Street, we lived across the street from what is now the County Courthouse. I have seen a big change there. It used to be Sinclair's Estate. They moved the Sinclair house over on Schanck Street. It is a big white house with pillars on it.  That used to be right where the courthouse is. And, that was the wealth that that family had.  But, I could go from Court Street toward Monument Street, and there was nothing but woods, fields, and all that, no houses in sight. I think the first development over there was Home Terrace. That is down by the Monmouth County Correctional Center.  Another big change that I saw was African Americans. They used to go to the Court Street School. I would pass them on my way to Saint Rose, and I never paid any attention to it.  And now, you know how desegregation came in, and everybody goes to school together.  We have seen a big change in the school system. And, the town changed a lot today.  Back then there were no traffic lights. There was no school crossing guard.  Everything is safety towards the children today.  You have the police patrolling the streets where children walk. Everything works out for the better.  There are a lot of changes in electricity, cars, a lot of change.    Ms. Bershad: Would you say the police department changes have been mainly in the size of the department or are there are any other big changes you can think of in the Freehold Borough Police Department?    Mr. Mount: Well, we did double our size, and I feel that there is better training than what it was back in the 1970s. Everything today is education now, which is good. And, I have seen a big change in the salaries. Now, police officers are making half way decent money.    Ms. Bershad: Of course, the cost of living is much higher too, you know, so you have to think of that.     Mr. Mount: Right. I moved here twenty-six years ago. My light bill was twenty-five dollars.  Today, it is ten times that.    Ms. Bershad:  Salaries have to go up to keep up with it.  Was there a change in Freehold Borough when the Rug Mill closed down?    Mr. Mount: As far as I can remember, there was a big change. The streets changed. The people sold their homes, and a lot of people were out of work.  The economy in this town just fell right through, you know. Nestle didn't come in till maybe1940, maybe 1950, or something or that. And, I have seen a lot of my parents' friends. They moved from this town to South Carolina. That is where the Rug Mill moved to.  There was a big change in the economy. Yes, that really hurt the town when they moved out.    Ms. Bershad: Nestle helped it a little bit.  It was another employer. But now what is happening in that area where the Rug Mill once was?     Mr. Mount:  They've got a nice big park over there, Liberty Street Park. We used to go over there to the softball games.  That was fun for the children.  Now, some of the homes, the landlords weren't keeping them up, but now there are tougher laws to enforce all that.  If you go over there now, you will begin to see it is beginning to be a nice area. Where before, the landlords didn't care about painting the homes or all that. There was a lot of crime. We had to go over there a lot of times.  Drugs were the biggest problems.  In fact, drugs are the biggest problem in Freehold today.  And, of course, everybody has that problem.    Ms. Bershad:  I understand you have an interesting story about your brother and the Lindbergh kidnapping back in the 1930s.  That would be when Charles Lindbergh's son was kidnapped wasn't it?  Would you care to talk a little about that?    Mr. Mount:  My mother and father told me that they were out for a drive, and at that time they had one child, which would be my oldest brother, Charles. He resembled this Lindbergh baby. My father stopped at the checkpoint on the road. The State Police saw this young baby.  They actually took by parents back to the barracks and they took my brother, Charles with them to make sure he wasn't the baby. My father laughed about it. That was a shame about the baby.    Ms. Bershad: Was this in Flemington?    Mr. Mount: No, I believe this was in or around Lakehurst. My father used to like to go down there and watch, at that time, they had the gates open. In fact, my father was there when The Hindenburg went down. He witnessed that.  Yes, they had a little scare that day. Charles did look like the Lindbergh baby.    Ms. Bershad: Well, Kenny, I want to thank you very much for this interview. It has been very interesting, and I look forward to seeing it when they have it all typed up. I will give you a copy.    Mr. Mount: Thank you, and it has been a pleasure.  
MonmouthCounty;Karen Slobodin;1933;2000;Karen Slobodin, 1933, 2000              Remembering The 20th Century: An Oral History of Monmouth County      Karen Slobodin (left) and her Aunt Edie, present day  Date of Interview: May 19, 2000  Name of Interviewer: Alison Lenox  Premises of Interview: Ms. Slobodin's home, Holmdel, NJ  Birthdate of Subject: December 20, 1933    Ms. Lenox: Thank you so much for meeting with me today. I really appreciate it.    Ms. Slobodin: It's my pleasure to do it.    Ms. Lenox: Even though it's all rainy and everything, I feel nice and warm and toasty in your house. So why don't you start at the beginning. You were born in Hightstown, but when did you move to Monmouth County?    Ms.  Slobodin: When I was four years old. My parents had lived in Hightstown. They were killed in an automobile accident, so I went to live with my aunt and uncle in Millstone.    Ms. Lenox: Oh no, when you were only four! Oh my gosh, that's devastating.    Ms. Slobodin: It was a pretty traumatic thing.    Ms. Lenox: So you moved to your aunt and uncle's house when you were four. Was this your Mom's sister?    Ms. Slobodin: This is my father's sister. So I grew up in a family with three of their own children, and my younger brother.      Karen Slobodin, 1944  Ms. Lenox: Oh, there were two of you.    Ms. Slobodin: Yes.    Ms. Lenox: What happened when you started going to school? Where did you go to school exactly?    Ms. Slobodin: Millstone Township had two four-room schools. That was the entire school system. One school was in Clarksburg, and the other was in Perrineville. Since we lived closer to Clarksburg, I went to that school. I actually started when I was four and a half years old, because I could read already.    Ms. Lenox: Oh, you were a fast learner!    Ms. Slobodin: I was very lucky. The county sent a helping teacher to our house to hear me read and make her judgment. She decided that I would be all right, so I went to Clarksburg. The school was set up so that we had kindergarten, first and second grades in one room  third and fourth were in another room  fifth and sixth in another room  and then seventh and eighth were together. They were in a wooden clapboard school that had a bell with a rope hanging down from the belfry. And that was the bell that summoned you to begin classes, and told you when they were over. If you were very, very good, you would get the opportunity to be the person to pull the bell.    Ms. Lenox: That's great. How many students were in your class?      Doctor conducting school physicals  Ms. Slobodin: Not too many. In the whole school there were about fifty-five students, so it was really small. I would say the kindergarten probably had about twelve children. The grades all sat next to each other. So in kindergarten, if you were able to keep up with what the first grade was doing, you could do that. I could read pretty well already, and the rest of the kindergartners had little notebooks that they had to write words in and do flashcards. But I didn't need that. So I would listen in on what the first grade was doing. It was very much like what we have today with the open classes. This was well before that. We had the one teacher. And discipline was a lot different in those days.    Ms. Lenox: What did they used to call it? There is a word for what you'd call that kind of discipline. Inhumane? (Laughter) Were they allowed to hit you and put you in your place?    Ms. Slobodin: Well, they didn't hit you so much, except with a ruler on your knuckle if you weren't doing something right. But I was a big talker, and I was punished for that very frequently by being put in a closet.    Ms. Lenox: You're kidding!    Ms. Slobodin: I'm not kidding. They had a cloakroom in each room. You would hang your coat and keep your lunch in this room. There were closets in there where they kept supplies. So if you were really bad, they'd stick you in this closet and shut the door. And then you would be in the dark.    Ms. Lenox: For how long?    Ms. Slobodin: I don't know, but it seemed like forever. It was probably like twenty minutes. That was to calm you down so that when you came out, you wouldn't continue talking. That was one punishment. Another one I remember very well, because I thought the last one was fun.    Ms. Lenox: You thought being in a closet was fun?    Ms. Slobodin: The closet had musical instruments like triangles, little oatmeal box drums, and things like that. And I'd be busy! (Laughter) The other punishment was having to sit under the teacher's desk. Yes, you would have to sit on the floor under her desk, and I don't know what the purpose of that was. The desk had an opening on the bottom, so you could peer out and wave at everybody and laugh! (Laughter)    Ms. Lenox: Well, that's a big punishment, too. My goodness.    Ms. Slobodin: But those were the kinds of punishments in those grades. Then you would move up to a different room next door. And there was no indoor plumbing until 1942. We had two outhouses out in the back of the school. One was for the girls, and one was for the boys. The girls' outhouse had two rooms. One had four large holes, and the other one had four small holes. (Laughter) And there wasn't any room for modesty because when we had recess, we'd all get marched out there and we'd line up and four at a time would go in. There was a pump since there was no running water. So you had to have your own little bar of soap and your own little pink cup. I remember I had a collapsible pink cup I would carry to school with me.    Ms. Lenox: Now that was for drinking?    Ms. Slobodin: Yes. You would line up at the pump to get water. One person would pump, and you'd all put your little cup underneath. So you had to bring that from home.    Ms. Lenox: How long was the school day?    Ms. Slobodin: I think it was probably like 9:00 a.m. until 3:30 p.m. I don't remember when we got home. We had a long ride because it was a farm community, and there weren't that many people close together. So you had a long ride. I lived in Smithburg, actually, which is right on the border of Freehold Township, and we had to go all the way to Clarksburg and around where there were a lot of farms. And it was almost in Mercer County. There was a bus, but it picked up a lot of people and took a long time.    Ms. Lenox: So do you have any idea what time you would get on the bus, was it like 7:00 a.m.?    Ms. Slobodin: No, it was probably around 8:00 a.m., or something like that. It would take about an hour to get to school. And we had a safety patrol, and we had the State Troopers come once a month and give safety lectures. When you got older, you had the honor of wearing this brass badge on your arm. And then you'd be in charge of the safety on the bus. That way the bus driver didn't have to bother with keeping us quiet. I remember my older sister was a bus monitor. To keep people quiet, if they wouldn't be still enough, she had a roll of tape she'd use to tape your mouth. Oh yes, they did all kinds of things that are unheard of today!    Ms. Lenox: Absolutely unheard of, yes. Do you think that kind of discipline helped...do you think it stopped kids from acting up?    Ms. Slobodin: No, not really, not that. But I think you could get in serious trouble when you got rapped or a teacher knocked you on your head, which did happen occasionally if you were really bad. But for those of us who were just being mischievous, I don't think it really made any difference. The ones who were really bad were so bad that...(Laughter) There were a few boys who had been kept back. In those days you kept people back if they didn't pass at the end of the year. They were held back more than once, sometimes. So we had in the fifth grade, some boys that were almost fourteen or fifteen years old. They were very big, and they did a lot of mischievous things. There were bullies, too.    Ms. Lenox: Now you said it only went up to eighth grade. Was that all the schooling you got?    Ms. Slobodin: Oh no, they had high school. But to go to high school, you had to go to Allentown High School.    Ms. Lenox: That sounds far.    Ms. Slobodin: It is very far. You don't know. Allentown is near Trenton. Because I lived on the border with Freehold, it really would've been a tremendously long ride. So in my family, all of us went to Freehold High School.    Ms. Lenox: Freehold Borough?    Ms. Slobodin: Yes, Freehold Borough. It was just too much to travel to Allentown, and you only had to pay the difference in tuition and you could go to Freehold. And the bus stopped right across the street, so that was like a thirty-minute ride.    Ms. Lenox: That's a lot better, right? Was there indoor plumbing at Freehold High School?    Ms. Slobodin: At the High School they did.    Ms. Lenox: That was a big jump then  you must have been in shock when you went to high school.    Ms. Slobodin: Oh, no. I wasn't, because we got indoor plumbing in the schools in 1942, I think. That was really very luxurious with tiled bathrooms and fountains in the hallway. But we had a lunchroom at that time. Before then, we had to bring our own lunches with a thermos bottle, and all that. You would eat in your class then, right at your desk. Then you would have recess and go out and play. But when we got the plumbing and they had running water in the school, we got a lunchroom. It was through the PTA I think. My mother was the president. And then you could get money from the government for lunch subsidies, because there were a lot of really poor kids in Millstone who lived on farms. So we had a lunchroom in the basement of the school, and there were two women that did the cooking.    Ms. Lenox: I loved my lunch ladies.    Ms. Slobodin: I got overdosed on tomatoes! (Laughter) We grew a lot of tomatoes in Millstone on these farms. My mother, who was President of the PTA, got this idea that all of us could go out and pick tomatoes, and these ladies in the PTA would can them. Then they would be used in making the lunches we would get at school. So we would all go out and pick tomatoes, and then they would be canned. All winter long, we would get tomatoes with macaroni, tomatoes with frankfurters, and tomatoes with you name it. To this day, my brother and sister don't eat tomatoes!    Ms. Lenox: I bet! (Laughter)    Ms. Slobodin: That same lunchroom, which was in the basement, was also used during WWII as a bomb shelter. We used to have air raid warnings...    Ms. Lenox: Yes, I was about to get into the War and how that affected you. So you were still in school at that time?    Ms. Slobodin: Oh, yes, I was in school all during the War. The sirens would go off. There was a firehouse across the street, so we'd always hear the sirens very loudly. Then you would go down into the basement in an orderly fashion. And there were sandbags lined up against the walls, and we'd have to crunch down in there so you would be in the right position if something had happened.    Ms. Lenox: And did you really feel in fear of something happening, or did it become so passé that you didn't worry...like a fire drill now in schools? I never paid attention to them.    Ms. Slobodin: Exactly. I never felt fear, not really.    Ms. Lenox: I heard some people talk about the 1950s, and they had those...    Ms. Slobodin: That was different. In the 1950s, that was a nuclear bomb scare. Because of the Cold War, there was a lot more fear in general, I think.    Ms. Lenox: But in 1942 you didn't really feel that...it was overseas and didn't really affect you?    Ms. Slobodin: Right. It was far away. I remember listening to the radio and hearing the crackling reports, you know, on the short-wave radio of what was happening.    Ms. Lenox: I want to talk to you about the War, and how it affected your family, since you brought it up. Did any of your family go and participate in the War? Did your mom or anyone want to? (If someone is listening to this tape: when you refer to your mom and dad now, you really are talking about your aunt and uncle, right?)    Ms. Slobodin: That's right.    Ms. Lenox: And because you were so young, understandably they would take on the role as your parents.    Ms. Slobodin: That's right.    Ms. Lenox: Ok, I just wanted to clear that up. Did your mom work for the War effort or your dad go overseas?    Ms. Slobodin: No, my father, I guess, was too old. He was in his forties. He was an Air Raid Warden. I remember he had a little tin hat, like the kind of helmets that they wore in World War I. Only his was blue, with a triangle on it, and he had an armband. He had this book where you studied all the silhouettes of enemy planes so that you could spot them. And we had blackouts, and you'd have to have your windows covered at night with something heavy so the light wouldn't shine out. The car headlights were supposed to be dim, not that you could travel that much because we had gas rationing. So you couldn't really go that far anyway. But my dad would go out searching for planes. I don't know exactly why and when he did it, but he did go out. And my older brother, the oldest one, was the only one old enough to go to War. But he was exempt because he had a farm. Farmers were exempt, because they were needed to make the food.    Ms. Lenox: How much older was he than you?    Ms. Slobodin: He was twelve years older than myself.    Ms. Lenox: He had his own farm, or was he working on your dad's farm?    Ms. Slobodin: No, he had his own farm. My dad had a store.    Ms. Lenox: Oh, that's right, you did say that.    Ms. Slobodin: This was very important during the War, too, because we had rationing of a lot of things. We had ration books, and I don't know if you know about them.    Ms. Lenox: No, I don't know what they are.    Ms. Slobodin: Every person was issued a book of coupons.    Ms. Lenox: From the government?    Ms. Slobodin: Yes. There was an office in Freehold that distributed them to everyone in the county. Depending on your age, you would get so many stamps for meat, sugar, and gasoline. People had different stamps on their card. A person who needed his car because he did first aid would have an A stamp on his card. Most people had C stamps, which was a lower priority. So you could only get so many gallons of gasoline per month, so that curtailed what you could do. You could only buy so much meat and sugar, believe it or not. And in my dad's store, we would break open the five-pound bags of sugar and would measure it into one-pound bags. So that was one of my jobs.    Ms. Lenox: You worked at the store?    Ms. Slobodin: Oh, yes. I did a lot of chores there.    Ms. Lenox: Let's talk about the store now. When did you start working at the store?    Ms. Slobodin: I was seven years old. I could do my arithmetic, so if somebody came in and wanted to buy a candy bar, for example, I could make change very well.    Ms. Lenox: What kind of store was it? It was a general store?    Ms. Slobodin: Yes.    Ms. Lenox: Describe the store, because I don't think people nowadays understand what a general store is. What kind of things could you get there?    Ms. Slobodin: Everything under the sun from candy bars to women's dresses, to straw hats...    Ms. Lenox: Women's dresses? Wow.    Ms. Slobodin: Even medications, like cough syrup with my dad's name on it.    Ms. Lenox: What was the name of your dad's store?      Sketch of Smithburg   General Store  Ms. Slobodin: It was called the Smithburg General Store. Actually that's the picture of it that my brother drew from a photo. It was built in 1865.    Ms. Lenox: Is that a pen drawing?    Ms. Slobodin: It is a pen-and-ink drawing. And the store had gas tanks out in front, and it had a kerosene pump on the porch because a lot of people lit their homes with kerosene. They didn't have electricity. We did have electricity, but not everyone did. We had all the conveniences always, thank God!    Ms. Lenox: Did you have indoor plumbing?    Ms. Slobodin: Oh, yes. At home we did. But there were people who didn't. So in a sense it was like living in the nineteenth century because at night you'd go out, and you'd see kerosene lamps burning in people's homes.    Ms. Lenox: Where was the store?    Ms. Slobodin: It was on Route 537. About ten years ago, the county decided to widen the road to Great Adventure. They took that piece of property, and they razed the store. It's gone...it's where the road is. My heart really sank when I went by there the first time.    Ms. Lenox: Did he have a farm as well?    Ms. Slobodin: No. We didn't have a farm. The store was a full-time job, seven days a week from 6:00 a.m. until 10:00 p.m. And we all worked.    Ms. Lenox: How close were you to the store?    Ms. Slobodin: We were right across the street. And that house is still there. It has a historic plaque on it because it was built during the Revolutionary time. It was actually a stagecoach stop for stagecoaches from Philadelphia to New York.    Ms. Lenox: That's fantastic!    Ms. Slobodin: Yes. It was very old, and it had small rooms with small closets.    Ms. Lenox: So in this store, you sold everything. Then during the War, everything was rationed. Did you have people who did come in and could pay for things?    Ms. Slobodin: Oh, yes. My father had a big ledger that he kept accounts in. A lot of people would come in and tell him to "put it on the book." And my father had a lot of people who "put it on the book," and they didn't pay. He'd have to ask them for it then, and a lot of times he didn't get paid back. When he died, there were many, many people who had never paid him back.    Ms. Lenox: But he was a nice guy.    Ms. Slobodin: He was a really nice guy. He was also the mayor of the town.    Ms. Lenox: He was mayor of Smithburg?    Ms. Slobodin: He was mayor of Millstone Township.    Ms. Lenox: How many people were in Millstone when he was mayor?    Ms. Slobodin: Maybe five hundred. It was really small, but the farms were very big. Smithburg had a bar across the street from the store, and then there were a few farms, which were mostly owned by Italian farmers, who raised vegetables on one side of us. And that was considered a town...with the store. Then you'd go to Clarksburg, and there was another general store. They had a firehouse across the street and had a post office in the general store. And then they had the school. So that was another town. Then there were more farms. There were a lot of chicken farms around the Clarksburg area. Then you'd go to Perrineville, and there was another general store. And all of the general stores were owned by my relatives. That seemed to be the way to go.    Ms. Lenox: When did your father become mayor?    Ms. Slobodin: As far as I know, he was the mayor since I started school. It was for a really, really long time. And he was on the Board of Education. And I don't think they do that anymore...it's a little conflict of interest! (Laughter)    Ms. Lenox: But back then it probably was a good idea to have everybody involved in the same thing.    Ms. Slobodin: Yes, that's right. It wasn't so big that you had to have a bureaucracy, anyway. But if someone got hurt and they needed to go to the hospital, there was no hospital except in Red Bank or Trenton. You had to go that far. So my dad would take them wherever they needed to go, or to the doctor in Freehold, which was the closest place to go.    Ms. Lenox: So there would be a doctor down the road in Freehold Borough?    Ms. Slobodin: Yes. He used to make house calls, by the way. I remember the doctor used to come to our house. My brother invariably got a stomachache after Thanksgiving, and he'd come with his little black bag. He'd shut the door, and you'd hear by brother moaning and groaning in there. But it was a nice time. As far as the migrant workers go, with the store...    Ms. Lenox: They were involved with the store?    Ms. Slobodin: They came from these farms. Generally speaking, they had open-bed trucks where they would all stand in the back, or they had old school buses. The farmers would bring them up from Florida in the summer, well, actually in the spring. Then they would stay through until the end of the fall crop. Shocking as it may seem, all of them had living quarters in barns. I remember we would deliver food to different farms, sometimes. Clayton's Farm, which was a big potato farm right on 537, had a tremendous barn. Downstairs they had all the equipment, the cows, and so forth. And upstairs they had sleeping quarters, which I went up to with my father. They were just separated by blankets, you know, one family from another. And they had kerosene lamps, and that was it. And they worked in the fields all day picking potatoes. The farmers would bring them in at night, and very often they would be covered with dust from the fields. And their little children would be barefoot. And they would come into the store to buy stuff for their supper like chitlins, black-eyed peas, etc. We kept all of those things that we knew they liked. Once a week, they would make a really big shopping expedition to lay in enough staples for the week. So they would come in loads, so we would have maybe fifty people at a time in the store. And we would be rushing around. We'd put all these groceries into a big, cardboard box. Then they would take the whole thing out to the truck and put it in. These gangs were usually led by one person, who was like the leader. And he was like the crew leader, he would organize the crews. And it was really interesting because Saturday night was their night off. There was a bus in Freehold that would come down to Smithburg. I guess it must have gone to Fort Dix. It was a very busy road because Fort Dix was very active, and that was one way of going there during the War. You'd have a lot of convoys going there then. But on Saturday night, the bus from Freehold would stop in Smithburg in front of the store, and a lot of these people who worked on the crews all day would be all dressed up. They had on perfume, and the women wore fancy dresses and the men wore zoot suits. And they had chains dangling down, and I'm sorry that I didn't take pictures at that time. And I'd sit on our front porch and watch them.    Ms. Lenox: They'd be all decked out and then get on the bus, and then they'd go to where?    Ms. Slobodin: They'd go to Freehold for a night on the town. Freehold was wonderful. That was the big town, and everybody went to Freehold on Saturday night. It was very lively, and there wasn't anything outside of town. And they had two movie theatres right on Main Street.    Ms. Lenox: That's a big deal with two theatres there.    Ms. Slobodin: Yes, it was a very big deal. You know where the Hall of Records is? Right next to it is an office building. That was the movie theatre. And that was the nice one, and it was called The Strand Theatre. Everybody went, on either Saturday night or Sunday. We would go in the winter, when it wasn't so busy. We would go on Sunday afternoon, and you would meet everybody else with their families there. So, it was very sociable. There was another movie theatre called Liberty Theatre, and that was where Breech's Mens Store was on Main Street. It was in that area. And that theatre was kind of shady.    Ms. Lenox: It was just a little bit up the street?    Ms. Slobodin: Only a couple of blocks away, but that is where questionable people went with brown paper bags with something in it. So we didn't go there very often, but that was the theatre that had all the Westerns. It had all the serials, like the Charlie Chan movies. So occasionally my mother would relent and let me go.    Ms. Lenox: Maybe you'd be allowed to go on a Saturday afternoon?    Ms. Slobodin: Yes, right. Everyone always said it had "bed bugs" and it was not a good place to go. And sure enough, we went there and a few days later I was itching and itching. And we had to go to the doctor. It was a little "seedy." But there were a lot of places to go for ice cream, sodas, and there were bars, of course. The American Hotel was the big thing.    Ms. Lenox: So even back then the American Hotel was around?    Ms. Slobodin: Oh, it was very big and fancy then. And there was the race track.    Ms. Lenox: The race track was around then, too?    Ms. Slobodin: Oh yes, that was there too. So the streets were just filled with people visiting.    Ms. Lenox: So they came from all different areas. Obviously you came from Smithburg, and then other people would come from other areas all around Freehold.    Ms. Slobodin: Oh sure, from Colts Neck and Farmingdale. That was it, there was nothing else.    Ms. Lenox: It was just that main street, the main strip.    Ms. Slobodin: That was it, there really wasn't anything else.    Ms. Lenox: Let me just go back to the migrant workers for just one second. I want to clarify where they came from. You say they came from Florida...did they maybe also come from North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia?    Ms. Slobodin: It is possible, I don't recall. But I do remember Florida being mentioned. They might have come from North Carolina or Georgia, some of them. I remember in the fall when it would get a little cooler, they would all be wrapped up in sweaters, and we thought it was still pretty warm. You see, they had come from a very warm climate.    Ms. Lenox: Yes, right. Do you think they were all of a particular nationality?    Ms. Slobodin: Oh they were all Blacks...American Blacks. There were no Hispanics coming up then.    Ms. Lenox: African American. That's interesting.    Ms. Slobodin: I think during the winter they worked at the orange groves and what other things were grown down South.    Ms. Lenox: What type of people lived in your area? Were there other African Americans who lived in the area but were not migrant workers?     Ms. Slobodin: Yes.    Ms. Lenox: Were there Irish people and all different kind of backgrounds?     Ms. Slobodin: Actually, it was very diverse. There was a section in Millstone called Woodsville. That's the road between Smithburg and Manalapan, the back road. And a lot of Black people lived there, and it was like a ghetto in a sense. They had little houses and so on. Then there were little groups here and there. I don't know what they did for a living. I guess they worked on farms or they worked in Freehold, which had the rug mill. There were Blacks, and we had Black people in my school. There were not a lot, but there were some. When I look back on it now, it was pretty diverse in Smithburg. We are Russian Jewish, and the guy that owned the bar was Hungarian. The farmers immediately around us were all Italian immigrants who spoke with accents. There were a lot of immigrants. You know it never dawned on me until lately, when I have been thinking about it. There were a lot of immigrants! And then there were those who had been there forever, it seemed. Most of those people lived on Siloam Road. There were poor whites, not educated, and a lot of them were drunks. I remember seeing this one particular person, and he was middle-aged then. He always would go to the bar and get a bottle, and he would sit on our store's front porch with a bag over the bottle and drink and sing with all his cronies. And they were all having a good time. Then somebody would say, "Your mother's coming." And his mother would be coming down the road with a broom, to get after him!      The Smithburg Hotel  Ms. Lenox: To get a middle-aged man?    Ms. Slobodin: Yes. And then he would go. But it really happened. On Saturday night, the bar in Smithburg was pretty lively too. You could hear people singing, and they always played the western, cowboy music like "Back in the Saddle Again." We didn't have air conditioning and it was hot, so you had your windows open and you heard everything that was going on.    Ms. Lenox: You were talking about having a good time on Saturday night. As a kid growing up, you got to go to the movies. But was there anything else you got to do? Did you have friends? With them all being on different farms, it must have been hard to get together.    Ms. Slobodin: It was very difficult.    Ms. Lenox: But you had siblings...a younger brother and an older...    Ms. Slobodin: Yes, but it's not the same thing. They were older. There is a four-year difference between all of us, and they were in different groups.    Ms. Lenox: They didn't want to play with you.    Ms. Slobodin: They didn't want to play with me. They would say, "Get away, kid." I did have some friends, but it was difficult to get together because you couldn't ride your bicycle that far. I was allowed to ride maybe three or four miles, but no further than that. Occasionally one of my friend's parents would bring their child over, and we would play. Or I would go to their house. But mainly you didn't see that many people. So I did a lot of reading during the summer.    Ms. Lenox: Did you listen to the radio?    Ms. Slobodin: I listened to the radio a lot...all those old programs like Green Hornet and Tom Mix, etc.    Ms. Lenox: Was it like they portray it in the movies and things where the whole family sits around the radio and listens together?    Ms. Slobodin: Yes.    Ms. Lenox: Was Jack Benny on the radio?    Ms. Slobodin: Yes.    Ms. Lenox: You listened to Jack Benny on the radio.    Ms. Slobodin: The whole family would listen to Jack Benny and Fred Allen and his wife, Gracie. And there were a lot of musical programs. I liked Colonel McCormick from Chicago, and that had a theatre on Saturday night with all the operettas like the Student Prince and all the Romburg things. I knew them all. And there was Lux Radio Theatre on Monday nights with wonderful voices. Oh, I just loved it.    Ms. Lenox: So that was neat. You'd get to sit around the radio, and then you said that you read a lot. What kind of reading did you do? What was your favorite book back then?    Ms. Slobodin: Well, I liked Nancy Drew.    Ms. Lenox: Really! I love Nancy Drew. (Laughter) I thought it was only in my generation. Oh, wow!    Ms. Slobodin: She has been around forever.    Ms. Lenox: She certainly has.    Ms. Slobodin: And then there were the Bobbsey Twins, and they had a lot of adventures. There was The Bobbsey Twins at the Seashore, The Bobbsey Twins at the Mountains, and all those.    Ms. Lenox: Where did you get these books? At the library?    Ms. Slobodin: The library. Oh this is another interesting thing. I'm glad you brought that up. There was a library in Freehold...the County Library, which was the house on the corner of Broad Street and Manalapan Avenue.    Ms. Lenox: Is that where the library was? I always thought there used to be a library there...there is like a sign that said that or something. But I never quite understood this.    Ms. Slobodin: It was the first County Library, and it was just that one little house. But I thought it had a lot of books. They had a children's room. We went there occasionally, but what they did was to have a bookmobile that went out into rural areas. It would stop in Smithburg, and you could go onto this bookmobile. They had shelves of children's books, and they had books for adults, too. You would pick out what you wanted, and they would return in two weeks and pick up the books you read, and you could get some others. So that was a really good service!    Ms. Lenox: That's great.    Ms. Slobodin: It was, because they went to Smithburg and Clarksburg, and all these places. So it helped a lot.    Ms. Lenox: You became older then, and did you stay in the area? Have you stayed in this area your whole life?    Ms. Slobodin: I went away to college.    Ms. Lenox: You did? Where did you go?    Ms. Slobodin: Douglass College.    Ms. Lenox: So did I! What kind of degree did you get?    Ms. Slobodin: I got a degree in Political Science. I was a bookworm. And I worked at Princeton University as a research assistant for a couple of years. Then I got married. Of course in the 1950s, you didn't think about having a career that much after you got married. I got pregnant right away, and I had three children. We moved to Holmdel several years after we were married...to this house. And we just stayed in this house ever since. My husband is from New York, but he loved the country, so we just stayed here.    Ms. Lenox: So how long have you been here in Holmdel?    Ms. Slobodin: Forty-three years.    Ms. Lenox: Forty-three years in this house. That's fantastic!    Ms. Slobodin: It is unbelievable. It has been a very stable existence.    Ms. Lenox: Yes, it is, because nowadays it is very transient. People don't stay in their houses more than about five years or something like that.    Ms. Slobodin: That's really true. There are a few of us left, but most people who were here have moved. And there are a lot of new people now. So we don't have to move to get a new environment...everybody around us is new!    Ms. Lenox: That's right, they all come to your environment and change it! (Laughter) What do you think was the most significant thing that happened within your lifetime...growing up in Monmouth County? Well, you had automobiles at that time, is that correct?    Ms. Slobodin: We did, but there were still a few people who had a horse and wagons, believe it or not. In fact I can show you a picture. I told you I had published some stuff. There's a nostalgia magazine.    Ms. Lenox: So you had written an article in a magazine called "Good Old Days."    Ms. Slobodin: Actually what I would consider most monumental in terms of changing things, was the appearance of the supermarkets. It changed your whole way of life. You see, you take it for granted that you just go to the supermarket and buy everything. And you either write a check, pay cash, or whatever. There is no such thing now as saying, "put it on the book." It was a very personalized kind of business, the old general store. All of the stores were back then, because you knew the people individually and you could help them out if you knew they were having a hard time. It made it more of a life experience rather than just going shopping. You knew the people in the store as friends, and you knew what was going on in their lives.    Ms. Lenox: Right, like, "How is Martha? How is she doing now?" or something like that. You had a personal conversation with them. Where was the first supermarket?    Ms. Slobodin: In Freehold...I think it was Food Town or ShopRite. The Norkus brothers...I don't know if that means anything to you.    Ms. Lenox: Norkus Food Town. I think Norkus Corporation is Food Town.    Ms. Slobodin: They were the first one. When they opened up, a lot of the people started going there. It was so big and shiny and new, and of course our store was old and dusty.    Ms. Lenox: But that was kind of far for people, though. It was downtown, right?    Ms. Slobodin: Yes. But by then, after the War, you had gas again and most people got cars. The horses and wagons faded out. And I think it changed a whole way of life because people started traveling more and moving. Of course nothing happened in Smithburg for years and years. It stayed the same basically. But now if you ever go out there, they have million dollar homes out there. And it's a very fancy place to live, and you don't see a lot of these old timers. Probably none at all anymore. But I think the supermarkets changed something very radically. My uncles who had all these general stores, they were all immigrants...uneducated as far as having an American education. But they had the opportunity then to have a business with these general stores. But that disappeared.    Ms. Lenox: How long after the supermarket came into being in Freehold do you think was the demise of your dad's store? Was it a long period of time?    Ms. Slobodin: Yes, it took awhile. My dad died in 1971, and my brother continued the store. But it was going downhill. They were trying to keep up. Actually my brother and brother-in-law kept the store up. They started getting televisions in the store, and then they would have to install it. Things change because you have to keep up or compete with what is going on.    Ms. Lenox: So they adjusted what they were doing.    Ms. Slobodin: It got to the point where most people just stopped to get gas or buy a pack of cigarettes. They didn't do their weekly shopping there anymore. They went to town, because the prices were lower. That was the big thing...you couldn't compete with a big store as far as prices go.    Ms. Lenox: And the whole idea of personal service went out the window. Nobody really cared about it anymore.    Ms. Slobodin: Absolutely.    Ms. Lenox: I know that is one of the things I really miss. I go to a "inky-dinky" bank on 537 because people know me there! And I like that. And I think it's just not around anymore.    Ms. Slobodin: No, not at all. Everything is so impersonal that you miss another dimension, I think. It's too bad. And the people who come after you, they won't even know to miss it. That's just the way it is. But to me, that really was the beginning of the end of the old-time country living.    Ms. Lenox: Smithburg, to me, doesn't even seem like a town! Isn't it that intersection? (Laughter) Is that the town? Is that where the town was?    Ms. Slobodin: Yes. It is nothing.    Ms. Lenox: My mom always says, "That's Smithburg," and I say, "Where?" (Laughter) When did it all of a sudden not become the town? Do you remember that? Is it a town to you when you go by it?    Ms. Slobodin: There had been a nursery out on one of the side roads. They bought some of the farm land in Smithburg, and the people who had the farms moved out. Then some other farm equipment place bought some more property. The people just changed, too. They weren't the people you had known your entire life. There had been a lumber mill about half-a-mile down the road that people came to, and that was gone. And the bar was then owned by somebody I didn't know. Then the same migrant workers weren't coming up like they did before to work. Hispanics were coming in. Farms were not growing potatoes like they used to. They were growing other things then, and a lot of Hispanics started to kind of replace the Black workers, but they didn't come in the trucks that they used to. They were imported from Puerto Rico or Mexico and flown in, I guess.    Ms. Lenox: And did they stay here instead of going away?    Ms. Slobodin: Yes. Then Freehold started to change because there is a big Hispanic section.    Ms. Lenox: So when do you think that started happening? I thought it was within my lifetime. I thought the Hispanic population started happening when I was in my twenties, and I am in my thirties now.    Ms. Slobodin: No, it was earlier. As a matter of fact, we even had a Hispanic fellow working for us in our store. He came with his family. I guess a lot of them came to Lakewood, that whole area in between. There were a lot of poultry farms. And for some reason I think they were working more on the poultry farms, but I don't know why. But it was earlier than when you were in your twenties.    Ms. Lenox: Right, it sounds like it.    Ms. Slobodin: Probably in the 1950s. But imperceptibly, the farmers sold out. Levitt, the builder, was another big thing, with the tract housing.    Ms. Lenox: That was in the 1970s?    Ms. Slobodin: No, it was in the 1960s. When we moved to Holmdel, Matawan was a quiet, little one-horse town. And then Levitt started to build Strathmore, which is a really, really big development. There are thousands of homes there. And that started in the 1960s. And then it just grew and grew, and all the New Yorkers started coming in.    Ms. Lenox: So the whole Levitt boom was a big thing. And I think Hovnanian is today's Levitt. What was your take on that? What was your feeling at that time?    Ms. Slobodin: I was happy, I really was. There would be more people, and maybe we would get some interesting stores and things to go to. Having been brought up in fairly isolated circumstances, I loved to be with people and be able to do things.    Ms. Lenox: So you thought it was going to bring a lot more to the area?    Ms. Slobodin: Yes, and it did. Of course now we are at the other extreme. There is so much traffic and congestion. I don't like that. But at the time, I didn't think it was bad. And people could afford to buy their own homes. Do you know how much one of those homes cost back then? Ten thousand dollars! Can you believe it?    Ms. Lenox: But that was lot of money at the time, right?    Ms. Slobodin: I guess, because you have to consider inflation. But it's still modest percentage-wise.    Ms. Lenox: Was this house affordable for you?    Ms. Slobodin: Oh, yes. We paid eighteen thousand dollars. You can't even buy a car for that now!    Ms. Lenox: That's great. No you can't buy anything for that now! (laughter)    Ms. Slobodin: So I thought that was good. And Brookdale College opened up, and I thought that was wonderful.    Ms. Lenox: When did that happen?    Ms. Slobodin: That happened in 1969. I worked at Brookdale for many years. So I have seen it change, too. It was a wonderful thing for the county to have it. It brought in a lot of interesting speakers and opportunities for people to take courses, and so on.    Ms. Lenox: You had said you went to Rutgers University. Douglass College is part of Rutgers University, right?    Ms. Slobodin: Actually, I was right on the cusp. Until the year that I graduated, it was known as New Jersey College for Women. The year that I graduated, they had planned to switch it to Douglass, after the first Dean. So I was the first graduating class from Douglass. It was part of Rutgers, but not like it is now. It was a very loose affiliation, I think. And today it is much tighter.    Ms. Lenox: Was this the only school to go to?    Ms. Slobodin: Oh, no. I had options. I was accepted at Barnard in New York, but they didn't have housing. It was very tight housing in those days, so I didn't go there. There were a lot of schools.    Ms. Lenox: Did you go to Rutgers to be near your family? Because it wasn't that far away.    Ms. Slobodin: I wanted to go away! (Laughter) I did not want to be near home.    Ms. Lenox: Well, I went to Rutgers, and it was far enough away for me, yet close enough at the same time.    Ms. Slobodin: Exactly. I could come home if I wanted to, but I didn't come home that often. There were a lot of things happening.    Ms. Lenox: You said something about Brookdale coming in 1969. Was that a big deal?    Ms. Slobodin: Yes, it was a very big deal for the whole area. It had been a horse farm  Thompson's Horse Farm. I could talk about that, if you want me to.    Ms. Lenox: Yes, I love you to.    Ms. Slobodin: When it opened in 1969, they still had the barns that they were using as classrooms and for administration. Barns! In fact, I started taking some classes there. My children were still little. I went to take a class in one of the horse barns, and it had stalls. Of course they were all cleaned up. But one of the stalls was like a little eating place. They had benches you could sit on. But the classrooms were just screened off areas in this big, open barn. And it was a very, very rural feeling. There was a corn crib in the middle, and there were just two buildings. Do you know where the Creative Arts Center is at Brookdale? The white one. It was one of the original barns, and the other barn was torn down when they built the new Administration Building. But it was very small, and it was very cozy. The president was from California, and full of radical ideas. He would appear in these stalls every week to talk to the students, and everybody could come and talk about whatever was on their mind. And you knew everyone. Of course most of the teachers were like hippies. They were very liberal, and they believed in keeping everything "open" so you didn't have any walls. Anybody who said they wanted a wall was considered an "elitist"...a dirty word.    Ms. Lenox: And what kind of classes did you take?    Ms. Slobodin: I took a class in Black History, because that was very big then in the 1960s. And it was very, very interesting to me. Then I took a journalism course. But then I started working there in the Reading Department, and I went back to school and got my masters. And then I taught there.    Ms. Lenox: Oh really. Your masters in what?    Ms. Slobodin: Reading Specialist. Brookdale had a Reading and Study Skills Department, and it had an open enrollment. So students who were not very good in high school didn't always succeed when they got there. In the beginning it was voluntary. You could come in for help if you needed it, with your other courses. But then it became mandatory to take a test. If you couldn't pass the reading, writing and math skills, then you had to take certain courses to build up your skills. So that's what I did. It was really interesting. I liked it.    Ms. Lenox: And how long did you do that?    Ms. Slobodin: For twenty years.    Ms. Lenox: My goodness. Twenty years at Brookdale?    Ms. Slobodin: Yes.    Ms. Lenox: That's great. When did you finish there, what year?    Ms. Slobodin: 1991 or 1992 I think. It's kind of fading away now. (Laughter) But I still go over there a lot. There a lot of things going on like talks, movies, bus trips, etc.    Ms. Lenox: Yes, they have a lot of things going on. And I think it has been really amazing for the community.    Ms. Slobodin: It is necessary now. You have to have a place for young people, or even old people, to go.    Ms. Lenox: Monmouth University, I think it's now called...used to be Monmouth College. When did that come into existence?    Ms. Slobodin: Monmouth was a junior college and wasn't affiliated with anything, I think. It was a junior college when we moved here. It was a two-year school, and then it became a four-year school.    Ms. Lenox: Was it here before Brookdale?    Ms. Slobodin: Yes, before Brookdale. Actually it was from at least the 1940s, or maybe even earlier. Then they enlarged, and it became a four-year school. Then it became Monmouth College, and before that it was Monmouth Junior College. Then it became Monmouth University in the last few years. Once a month, a music teacher would come.    Ms. Lenox: Where are we talking about?    Ms. Slobodin: When I was in grammar school. We had a visiting music teacher who would come once a month. She would play the piano, and we would learn new songs. And in between her visits, our teachers could play the piano and we would have weekly assemblies. Because you had the four rooms, the seventh and eighth grades, and the fifth and six grades were back-to-back. They had folding doors between them. You opened those doors, and the whole school would come in for the assembly. So different people got to play the piano. Sometimes the teacher would play and we would all sing, or sometimes students would play. I did this sometimes. We had all these old songs from the songbook like "Old Black Joe" and "Carry Me Back to Old Virginny," etc. They were really old songs. And people are always amazed that I know all these songs, but we learned them in school.    Ms. Lenox: And that was something that everybody learned. It was just part of the program, and you didn't even think about it.    Ms. Slobodin: Yes.    Ms. Lenox: Now everybody says you have to offer music lessons and this and that in schools. But it was so well-rounded back then, it sounds like. You got a little bit of everything.    Ms. Slobodin: We did. Actually we got a really excellent education there. The teachers were very knowledgeable in everything. We read a lot and had a lot of homework. And that was that.    Ms. Lenox: People complain so much now that kids have too much homework. What do you think?    Ms. Slobodin: I think it's good to have homework. I don't like mindless homework, but it's a good idea to learn how to do things on your own.    Ms. Lenox: You have the responsibility that you have something to do, and you bring it in the next day.    Ms. Slobodin: Yes. So we'd have these assemblies, and it was long before the Supreme Court made any rulings about prayer in the schools and keeping religion out of the schools. So we all sang Christmas songs and had a Christmas play, and nobody ever complained about anything. You just did it.    Ms. Lenox: You say you are Russian Jewish. Did you practice your Jewish religion? Did you practice Hebrew?    Ms. Slobodin: We kept our Jewish holidays at home. But because the store was open seven days per week, we didn't really do anything. When I was in high school, I wanted to go to Sunday School and find out more. But that was long after the fact. We knew we were Jewish.    Ms. Lenox: But you didn't feel different from everybody else. Everyone was the same...you all learned the Christmas songs and did it all together.    Ms. Slobodin: That's right. I never really thought about it. I never heard my parents complain that we were learning Christmas songs. It was just something you did, and I love them even to this day.    Ms. Lenox: But it didn't take away from your own religion.    Ms. Slobodin: No, not at all. That's why I could never understand a lot of the dissension today about it. I just thought it was fun. We would decorate a Christmas tree in school and make paper chains and all that.    Ms. Lenox: But you didn't have a Christmas tree at home?    Ms. Slobodin: No.    Ms. Lenox: And you did Hanukkah at home.    Ms. Slobodin: Yes.    Ms. Lenox: Did you have a lot of families in the area that were Jewish?    Ms. Slobodin: There were a few, but I won't say a lot. But there were quite a few.    Ms. Lenox: In school they didn't celebrate any Jewish holidays, did they?    Ms. Slobodin: No. Hanukkah wasn't a big deal in those days. It was just something you did at home. It was after World War II that it started to become more popularized and commercialized with all the gift-giving and everything. But people didn't talk about that then.    Ms. Lenox: From what college did you get your masters degree?    Ms. Slobodin: Monmouth University. I started at Kean, but it was too much of a ride after work.    Ms. Lenox: Where did you work?    Ms. Slobodin: At Brookdale.    Ms. Lenox: So you worked at Brookdale and at night you would get your masters degree.    Ms. Slobodin: Yes.    Ms. Lenox: And then you went back to Brookdale as an instructor.    Ms. Slobodin: Well, things were changing. When I began working there, all you needed was a bachelor's degree to teach. Then they started tightening up, and you had to have a masters degree, but it could be in anything. Then they said you had to have a masters degree in the subject which you were teaching. So I saw the handwriting on the wall, and I decided I needed a reading degree. So that's what I did.    Ms. Lenox: Did you ever think of moving out of the area?    Ms. Slobodin: Yes, I did. But my husband loves it here! (laughter) So I'm stuck. Actually I love New York, but I don't know if I'd want to live there all the time. But I do love to go there.    Ms. Lenox: And do you go into New York a lot?    Ms. Slobodin: Fairly often. I have a daughter who lives in New York, and I go in to see plays and museums fairly often.    Ms. Lenox: Thank you very much, Karen.    Ms. Slobodin: You are welcome, I enjoyed it.      
MonmouthCounty;Juliette Narunsky;xxxx;2000;Juliette Narunsky, xxxx, 2000    Remembering The 20th Century: An Oral History of Monmouth County  Date of Interview: March 17, 2000 Name of Interviewer: Lydia Wikoff Premises of Interview: Ms. Narunsky's home, Manalapan, NJ Birthdate of subject: N/A  Ms. Wikoff: Juliette was very involved in her family's background in the Borough of Freehold, and she is going to tell us about her uncles and aunts and how very much they kind of ran the town. I would like her to tell us about her beginnings, and then we will become more up-to-date. I also remember that she married a druggist in Englishtown.   Ms. Narunsky: I was born on a farm on Route 522 that is now practically falling apart. The house is falling apart now. There used to be a house on the other side of the railroad track where my sister was born. And then they moved to this house next to the Cobb House. And we lived there a year or so, and then we moved across the road to the big house that is being remodeled now by the county.  Ms. Wikoff: This is the house that was called the Derrick Custom House now for the very early owners, and it is going to be restored for the Battlefield State Park as a woman's history site in the Revolution. Please continue.  Ms. Narunsky: Then when I was five, we moved to the big city of Freehold, and I went to the Broad Street School for the first three grades, and my teachers were Ms. Curley, Ms. Moffet, and Ms. Symmes. Ms. Symmes' father was a minister at the Tennent Church, and Symmes Drive is named after that family.  Ms. Wikoff: I'd like to say that Ms. Symmes started teaching before she really had the certificate that a teacher would eventually have to have, but evidently in those days, you could do that. But then she went on to get many degrees.  Ms. Narunsky: Then in the fourth grade, I went to the Hudson Street School. I was there for fourth, fifth, and sixth grades. I don't remember my fourth grade teacher, but my fifth grade teacher was Ms. Hulsart, and my sixth grade teacher was Ms. McNinney. I went to the Intermediate School, which is now the Police Station in Freehold, for the seventh and eighth grade. The principal was Ms. Fogerty, and we were always scared of her. When I was in, I guess it must have been the third grade, they took us for a walk to what is now the Freehold Borough High School for the dedication of the high school. And when I went to Freehold High School and graduated from there, and some of the teachers were Ms. Button, Mr. Clayton, Mr. Hoover, Mr. McKelvey. Let me see if I can remember some more.  Ms. Wikoff: I have to tell you that she said the name of the teacher was Ms. Button. I remember her name was Pearl, and we all used to laugh because she was Pearl Button, and she just died, I think just a few years ago.  Ms. Narunsky: And her fingernails were always pointed. I remember that. I never saw such pointed fingernails. Things you remember!  Ms. Wikoff: She was very active in her college after she retired from teaching. New Jersey College for Women (NJC), which is now, called Douglass College.  Ms. Narunsky: And there was a Ms. Tilton there. I forget whether she was Tilton or Vanderveer. I think she was Tilton and then married a Vanderveer. She was the stenography and typing and bookkeeping at Freehold High School. Following high school, I went to work for my uncle, Jake Zlotskin, who had a cattle farm, and I worked there for five years. And then in 1942, I went to work at Fort Monmouth for the Army. I worked there for a few years. Then I moved, and transportation was hard, so I changed jobs. I went to Earle and I worked there, where I became Supervisor of Civilian Payroll.   Ms. Wikoff: That was a mighty impressive job.  Ms. Narunsky: It sure was. When I was leaving to get married, the commander who was in charge, after I became head of the department, was thrilled because he appointed a man to head the department. He didn't think women should head a department. I met my husband at a vacation spot in Pennsylvania. He was living in Washington, and I was living in Freehold. That was a long distance romance, and after we knew each other three months, we got engaged, and in six months we got married, and I moved to Washington, where we lived for about a year. My husband bought the drug store in Englishtown, and so we moved to Englishtown. We had the drug store for twenty-two years, and we built a home on Gordons Corner Road that I lived in for thirty years.  Ms. Wikoff: I remember that house. It was right near the corner.  Ms. Narunsky: Yes, and so I have lived here in the area all my life. I am happy here. Now I live in Covered Bridge. I've been here over fourteen years.  Ms. Wikoff: Oh, my goodness. I didn't realize that.  Ms. Narunsky: Well, I lived alone for eight years in the house until I came home from work one day, and it was snowing. Now I am very stubborn, and I got stuck in my driveway, and I shoveled snow until I got pains in my chest. And I said, "Now it is time to move." (Laughs) I sold my house and moved to Covered Bridge where a lot of my friends from Englishtown were living.  Ms. Wikoff: And from Freehold, too?  Ms. Narunsky: Yes, Freehold. There was Murray and Lil Yacknowitz, Dr. Sam and Mildred Bar. He is still living near Philadelphia in a residential home.  Ms. Wikoff: He was our doctor.  Ms. Narunsky: Elaine Kuschik. Her husband was the mayor of Manalapan for many years before he died. And Ida Slade was living here. Ida was a chicken farmer. Then she went to work for the Library. And Joe and Lil Bell live here. He worked for Washington Ford. And Elaine, who had a farm in Englishtown, lives here. I am trying to figures others who live here.  Ms. Wikoff: Well, that's wonderful. I think the next thing would be for you to tell us about your relatives who had so many different businesses in Freehold.  Ms. Narunsky: Well, my father had Lopatin Electric. My uncle had Lopatin Construction. The third uncle had a re-upholstery business. A fourth uncle had the Outlet Store in South Street in Freehold.  Ms. Wikoff: Who owned Two Brothers?  Ms. Narunsky: The Belblum family.  Ms. Wikoff: Oh, because I remember Two Brothers so well.  Ms. Narunsky: Well, Rebecca and Dorothy, the daughters of one of the two brothers, are still alive and living in Freehold.  Ms. Wikoff: Do you remember where Ballew Jewelry used to be right next to them?  Ms. Narunsky: Yes. And there is still Ballew Jewelry. The grandson is running it now. All these things. I remember when we were kids, I guess the first or second year we lived in Freehold, in the summer time, Mike's Ice Cream man used to come with a horse and buggy and sell us ice cream cones for three cents. And a man from Tennent used to come  on Saturday during the summer to sell vegetables in Freehold. And I want to remember, he was a very tall man. He was from Tennent.   Photograph of a parade in downtown Freehold  Ms. Wikoff: Alright. Wasn't he the one who played Uncle Sam in all the parades? He was unusually tall, I think seven foot. Isn't that something? I never knew he went and sold vegetables.  Ms. Narunsky: I remember him. Well now, one of my two uncles died in 1915. He was killed in a railroad accident behind where the Cobb house is now.   Ms. Wikoff: I remember reading about that.  Ms. Narunsky: And the other uncle, Max, the one that had the outlet store, was killed crossing a railroad track near the J. L. Montgomery home.  Ms. Wikoff: Because there were no flagmen and no crossing gates at all there.  Ms. Narunsky: No, just an open track.  Ms. Wikoff: That was a tragedy.  Ms. Narunsky: Well, let's see what else I remember.  Ms. Wikoff: Well you said you worked for your uncle. He would buy the calves from the local farmers. In fact, I remember him so well. He would come to the farm, and he would hang up a calf. It looked kind of cruel, but I guess it didn't hurt them, but that is the way he would weigh them, and he would pay by the weight. I have no idea how much.  Ms. Narunsky: I don't remember that. I remember working on the farm, and now when we were on the farm in Manalapan, we had a windmill.   Ms. Wikoff: Isn't that something?  Ms. Narunsky: There was a windmill where the house is being restored. I don't know who took it down.  Ms. Wikoff: I don't think there are any pictures of that either.  Ms. Narunsky: No. And my sister and brother went to a one-room schoolhouse in Tennent.  Ms. Wikoff: Yes, well that's where my brother went. And, Ms. Cicmmum was a teacher there.  Ms. Narunsky: Mrs. Woodward was a teacher there, too, because she taught when we first moved to Englishtown. She came into the store and told me that she taught my father English when he came to this country. And I went to high school with her son, Howard.  Ms. Wikoff: Oh, my goodness.  Ms. Narunsky: And my daughter went to grade school with her grandson.  Ms. Wikoff: How about that!  Ms. Narunsky: So you know the family as well. Now Woodward Road is named for them.  Ms. Wikoff: Yes. Well Carl Woodward was the older Woodward. He has written a manuscript about the history of this area and farming at the turn of the century, and we are hoping to get that published. It has never been published, and it is beautifully written, and documents this area so well.  Ms. Narunsky: When we first moved to Englishtown, some man came in the store and he said, in 1912 my uncle built his house in Englishtown. This was the uncle who was killed in 1915. I don't know, he was a carpenter. And, so my family has been around here a long time.  Ms. Wikoff: It really has. Do you want to stop for a moment and look at your notes?  Ms. Narunsky: Yes.  Ms. Wikoff: We have pictures here.  Ms. Narunsky: Clyde Murphy, I forget her name. Her father was a doctor, had his office on Broadway in Freehold. This is me. Do you know Bonnie Mahon?  Ms. Wikoff: No.  Ms. Narunsky: That is Marcella Ladd.  Ms. Wikoff: There are so many in this picture it seems.  Ms. Narunsky: Virginia Ladd, Virginia Hall. Her mother was a piano teacher in Freehold.  Ms. Wikoff: I remember that.  Ms. Narunsky: Ms. June Ladd.  Ms. Wikoff: Their father was a photographer, and almost all the local schools and other people people went to him to have their pictures taken.  Ms. Narunsky: And this is Arnie, Arnold Tanner. The lawyer in Freehold.  Ms. Wikoff: Right.  Ms. Narunsky: Billy Patton from the LumberYard. That is Warren Press from the Monmouth County Shop. Nick Ferman. Alex Kotko. Frank Whitman.   Eighth grade class of Freehold Intermediate School, 1931  Ms. Wikoff: Was he the superintendent?  Ms. Narunsky: No, no, no. He was the clerk for the Board of Education.  Ms. Wikoff: Well, we have a wonderful picture here, and all these names of local Freehold people.  Ms. Narunsky: See, there is another picture from 1930, in front of the school. And these are the reunion pictures.   Eighth grade class reunion, 1960     Ms. Wikoff: Are they the high school reunion?  Ms. Narunsky: And the 25th Anniversary. 1935 Class Reunion. There's me again.  Ms. Wikoff: We all dressed up in those days. (Laughs)  Ms. Narunsky: Mr. Hoover, Mr. McKelvey. His father had the Military School on South Street in Freehold. There's Arnold Tanner, the lawyer. Harry Silvert from Silvers Furniture is still in Freehold.  Ms. Wikoff: They look a lot a like.  Ms. Narunsky: There is Virginia Hall. Craig, his name was Craig. Warren Crest. Steve Subecko from Englishtown Auction.  Ms. Wikoff: Oh yes. I remember him very well. He used to be our Mayor in Manalapan. You were asking about Englishtown and the addresses and so forth. Englishtown separated from Manalapan Township in 1888, when we were right in Manalapan Township. Now, of course, Manalapan has grown large, but we still have no real hub as far as a little town goes. We lost that in 1888. Juliet has a lot of pictures here and a lot of papers. And, I was telling her that some of those should be laminated because they just won't keep otherwise.  Ms. Narunsky: Here are pictures of the shelves that we had and the drug store.  Ms. Wikoff: It was a shame when the drug store left, it kind of folded.  Ms. Narunsky: You needed a drug store in the town.  Ms. Wikoff: Now we have to get in a car and go out.  Ms. Narunsky: Well, nobody wanted to work seven days a week.  Ms. Wikoff: No, that's the trouble.  Ms. Narunsky: Well, my husband had a heart attack, well, two heart attacks, and the doctor says, no seven days a week. And, so we closed up.  Ms. Wikoff: We just hope that the town livens up.  Ms. Narunsky: We used to have a luncheonette and two banks, and a funeral home, and a clothing store.  Ms. Wikoff: And an ice cream shop, and a … We had just about everything in this town.  Ms. Narunsky: And shoemaker. It was a nice town. People were friendly. We knew everybody.  Ms. Wikoff: Especially you having a drug store, and you got to know their names.  Ms. Narunsky: And now every once in a while, I will bump into somebody who says, "Oh, how are you?" It's nice. But I still keep friends with one of the girls who grew up on my street in Freehold many, many years ago when I was five years old. About once or twice a year, we will call each other and say hi. That was the Bellamy family. They lived on Bowne Avenue in Freehold. And her father and mother worked at the rug mill. I remember all the families, and there was the Filan family, they worked at the rug mill, too. And there was Walter Briggs, he was a fireman. And every time we'd hear the alarm go off, we'd see him run up the street to get to the fire. And it was nice…Freehold was a nice town to grow up in. We had a lot of friends, and we took care of each other.  Ms. Wikoff: You probably didn't have much time for hobbies in those days. It sounds like you were working all the time.  Ms. Narunsky: Well, I started working when I was eleven years old in my uncle's store. And then I used to go out with him. He used to have charge accounts at the clothing store, and I used to go on Saturday with him collecting. I was a kid, but I wasn't afraid to go with him….. Yes.  Ms. Wikoff: It must have been fun for you?  Ms. Narunsky: So, I worked a long time. I worked when there was a department store on Main Street in Freehold. I worked there on Saturdays when I was in high school. After I graduated from high school.  Ms. Wikoff: Crine wasn't it? Was it Crines?  Ms. Narunsky: No, no, no. Crine was on one side of the street, and this was further down past the Strand Theatre. We had two movies in Freehold. We had the Liberty Theatre that burned down. The Strand Theatre burned down, too. We had a bowling alley that was near the Liberty Theatre. That burned down. And my father had a store right next door to the Liberty Theatre. Then he moved to South Street.  Ms. Wikoff: Were they able to save his store?  Ms. Narunsky: They saved some of the stuff, but … not too much. But they couldn't save the building, so then he moved to South Street. And, let me think if I can remember all the stores in Freehold. Saturday night in Freehold was a big thing. Everybody parked their cars on Main Street and sat and watched the people walk by and do all their shopping. Saturday, you got all dressed up and some people had a particular place where they wanted to park. And to park there, you'd have to get their early. I remember it so well. I remember the people would look at you when you came in the store.  Ms. Wikoff: I was going to go back to where we were talking about how she went with her uncle to collect because people paid by the week, and she and I both remember when insurance agents used to come weekly to collect ten, fifteen, twenty-five cents so that your insurance policy would be kept up. It almost makes you laugh today.  Ms. Narunsky: That's right. Money was tight and they came every week collect on your one-hundred dollar policy or whatever it was. I also have an Indian head arrowhead that my father found when he was farming the farm.  Ms. Wikoff: Called the Derrick Seddith Farm. It is now in the Battleground State Park.  Ms. Narunsky: Yes. And, I have one Indian head arrowhead left. We had more of them, but through the years, they got lost. We'd take them to school and they would disappear.  Ms. Wikoff: At Show and Tell.  Ms. Narunsky: And I have a newspaper article about the fire in 1964, where eight stores in Freehold were burned down. I have a lot of things. A copy from the Asbury Park Press announcing the wedding of my father and mother in 1914. It came from the Asbury Park Press, and they were married in a double ceremony with his sister and her husband from Asbury Park.   Ms. Narunsky's brothers, Sol and William Lopatin, before their service in the war Ms. Wikoff: That was quite unusual to have the double ceremony.  Ms. Narunsky: Yes. And I have a lot of old newspaper clippings when my cousins were in the Army, and the honors they got. My mother saved all these things, and I saved a lot of them. But, they are beginning to fall apart. I will have to take care of them and have them fixed. I have two children.  Ms. Wikoff: Yes. Tell us about your children.  Ms. Narunsky: My daughter went to the Manalapan School. Then she graduated from Marlboro High School. She was active in the band. My son went to Manalapan School, and he graduated from Freehold Borough High School. They both live in California now.   Ms. Narunsky in the hospital after the birth of her daughter, 1953  Ms. Wikoff: What are their occupations?  Ms. Narunsky: Right now my daughter is unemployed. She had a bookstore, and she closed it because the building was sold, and she is going to start looking for a job. She hasn't quite made up her mind what she wants to do. And my son is writing and reviewing movies for some man. And they both like it in California. They wouldn't come back.  Ms. Wikoff: Do you ever go to visit?  Ms. Narunsky: I went two years ago to visit, and my daughter was here in June. I'd rather they came here. It is a long trip, its tiring, and I have everything here that I like.  Ms. Wikoff: They'd probably like to come back to their roots.  Ms. Narunsky: I have pictures of my grandfather and grandmother that were taken on the farm in 1922. That was my paternal grandparents. And then I have a picture of my maternal grandfather taken in Freehold. So, I have been here all my life, and I love it.  Ms. Wikoff: And who was it that was taught English by one of the Woodwards?  Ms. Narunsky: My father. My father was taught by the Woodwards. So, you know old family names. You hear a name and you'll say, oh my daughter went to school with that one. My son went to school with that one. They used to tease me when they went to high school and I knew some of their friends, and I'd say, "Oh, I went to school with your mother or father." And they'd say, "Did you go to school with everybody?" But the Freehold High School, Marlboro High School, they were all local people. They didn't move around that much. They stayed in the neighborhood.  Ms. Wikoff: That is the difference today. And the one room school that you were talking about there in Tennent, the one room school, is still a home. It's not a school anymore, of course, but it is right there opposite the Tennent cemetery.  Ms. Narunsky: It is still a good-looking house.  Ms. Wikoff: Yes. I think the Historical Society dated that house, not that it was a century old at that time, but just because it had historical significance. Can you describe any childhood favorite things that you played?  Ms. Narunsky: That I don't remember. Oh, I had another uncle from my mother. All the uncles we have talked about were my father's brothers. My mother had a brother, Harry Cherin  he had a butcher's shop in Freehold. Then she had a sister in Freehold who was Mrs. Jacob Zlotkin, and one of her sons was in the cattle business with his father. And the other son was a lawyer, Isadore Zlotkin. Lou Zlotkin is a doctor, retired, and my cousin, Sylvia, married a doctor. And then Harry Cherin had three children. One was a lawyer. One had a drug store in Freehold. Eli Cherin had a drug store on Court Street. The Pharmacy.  Ms. Wikoff: Oh, I remember that.  Ms. Narunsky: And Joyce Sherman lives in the Villages. I have a sister who lives in the Villages. I have a brother, Nathan, who was an electrician. He lives in Tucson, Arizona. I have a brother, Bill, who lives in East Windsor. He is a pharmacist. And, my youngest brother, Irving, lives in East Brunswick, and he had a software company. They are all retired now. So, we have been around.  Ms. Wikoff: And your family was very prominent with their positions.  Ms. Narunsky: Here we stayed. Most of us have stayed near here. My sister, Celia, lives in the Villages, which is an adult community, the same as Covered Bridge. And we all enjoy where we are living. We stayed in the neighborhood  we like it. Little by little the cousins have died off, but I have one cousin, Bill, who is eighty-nine. He lives in Applewood Estates. He was in the construction business, and he lives in Applewood. And that's that. You know we stay pretty close to home.  Ms. Wikoff: Good! Well, that's wonderful!  Ms. Narunsky: After we closed our drug store, I got a job in hardware supply, plumbing supply house for twenty years. And I was the bookkeeper, and half ran the office, and ran everybody crazy, but it nice, it was fun. I got to know all the men who did plumbing work. They used to laugh with me. You want to be a plumber. You ought to get a job as a plumber's helper. And that was fun.  Ms. Wikoff: And what did your husband do after you had to give up the drug store? I think he wasn't in good health.  Ms. Narunsky: He worked for awhile part-time at different drug stores, but he couldn't do it, and he died twenty-two years ago.  Ms. Wikoff: Yes, yes, its been a long time.  Ms. Narunsky: But, that's life. You've got to make the best of it.  Ms. Wikoff: And you kind of live with your happy memories?  Ms. Narunsky: Yes.  Ms. Wikoff: And you have so many wonderful mementos here of your life and your family.  Ms. Narunsky: Yes. And I belong to a congregation, Sons of Israel. I'm a life member there.  Ms. Wikoff: That's in Manalapan.  Ms. Narunsky: My grandfather was one of the founders of Congregation. It's on Broad Street in Freehold. First they had the synagogue was on 2nd Street what we called Texas in Freehold. And I had the last wedding there. After that, they sold the building and they moved to the new building on Broad Street, the corner of Broad and Stokes in Freehold. So, I have newspaper pictures of that event.  Ms. Wikoff: Did you realize that Hovnanian built Covered Bridge? Previous to that, he built his first building here in the Township, Holiday North. He came over from Armenia, penniless. We happened to find out a lot about him and at the time that he started this development. My husband happened to be on the Board of Education. And along with all the other members of the Board, he said, "What are we going to do with all these children?" And Hovnanian, I think, because he knew the problem that he was given, built a school to state specifications, which is an unusually difficult thing to do. And you could build a school, but to build it to the state regulations was difficult. And to tell you the truth, it was a great asset. And he not only did that, but he gave four parcels of land and your Congregation Sons of Israel ….  Ms. Narunsky: He gave us land to build our new synagogue on Gordon's Corner Road. He also gave a piece of property that the Saint Thomas More Church is on. That's on Gordon's Corner Road, too.  Ms. Wikoff: He also gave a piece of property that the Pine Brook School is on. And he gave one other piece of property, but I don't think it was used, and so it stood vacant for years. I just have to say that because there have been no other developers since then who have been that generous.  Ms. Narunsky: I belong to the organizations. I try to keep up with what's going on around me.  Ms. Wikoff: That's good. I just had a lot of fun looking at those nice mementos that Juliet has saved from her family and maybe she will tell us about some of them that have to do with pharmacy and some things that have been in the family for a long time.  Ms. Narunsky: I have scales that were in the pharmacy that my husband had. They are old, very old pieces, because the pharmacy was there long before my husband.   Ms. Wikoff: Mr. Hamilton had it.  Ms. Narunsky: I have my mother's set of cups and saucers that were my mother's wedding present, and that was a long time ago, and a couple of pieces of cut glass that were given to my mother and father as wedding presents.   Ms. Wikoff: And I see an Aladdin lamp there. That's a kerosene lamp. And when you polished them underneath the nickel, there is brass.   Ms. Narunsky: My father made it electric for me. I use it once in a while. And, the statue next to it was what we brought back from my trip to Israel. We enjoyed that. We traveled quite a bit. I have been to Ireland, France, Italy, Israel, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Alaska, Hawaii, Canada, and quite a bit of the United States. Still come back to New Jersey. That's what I love. (Laughs)  Ms. Wikoff: Well, I think that is wonderful to share all that information. And it's nice that you have been able to travel.  Ms. Narunsky: Yes. I took a cruise on the Mississippi. It was a beautiful. It's a lot of fun.  Ms. Wikoff: We've done that. And it is one of the trips I enjoyed the most.  Ms. Narunsky: I've been to the Grand Canyon, and I've  been to Nashville. And I enjoyed them, but right now I am content to stay home.  Ms. Wikoff: I am happy that you shared all this information with us about your life. And, we are just delighted that you would participate in this oral history.   Ms. Narunsky: If they want to borrow my pictures, I will let them.  Ms. Wikoff: Very good. I highly recommend that they are laminated before they crumble.  Ms. Narunsky: I may have to take them and have them laminated.  Ms. Wikoff: Thank you again, Ms. Narunsky.

Julia DeCesare (Rifici)  Ms. Rifici: My date of birth is June 26, 1915.  I am now eighty-four years old. I have lived in Asbury Park all of my life. I remember way back when I was a child  I grew up on 1257 Washington Avenue in Asbury Park. And I went to Bangs Avenue School.  From Bangs Avenue School I transferred when I was twelve years old to Our Lady of Mt. Carmel School in Asbury Park. I graduated from Mt. Carmel School in 1929. I remember Asbury Park very, very well when it was a beautiful, beautiful city. And I remember during the Second World War we had a lot of different things that we had to do to help "the cause," as they said.  We had to put our shades down at a certain hour. We had to make sure we had all kinds of inspections going on the roads to prevent anyone from harming us. And one of the things that they did in Asbury, under the direction of our mayor, who at that time was Mayor Thomas Shebell, and now he is deceased, was the fact that on the Boardwalk in Asbury Park, which was a gorgeous place, they had put black curtains on the Boardwalk, so the lights of the Boardwalk would not go out to the ocean where the U-boats from Germany were going in the waters to try to bomb New York Harbor. So our black curtains stopped the lights from going out to the ocean  but we continued with our activities on the Boardwalk.  One activity was skating at the Asbury Park Casino.  We had the Paramount, where they featured some of the best well-known actors in that era. One was Rudy Vallee, who was a wonderful leader of the orchestra. We had William Holden. We had Clark Gable come down. We had all these wonderful stars who came to Asbury Park and I remember every one of them, because I was there as a teenager watching them. Then we had the beautiful Berkeley Carteret, which entertained many, many beautiful public figures. So consequently, our town was one of the best known towns around the area. From there, I lived on Washington Street.  I worked downtown on Cookman Avenue at the HL Green 5&10 for fifteen years. Then I went to different jobs in the area. I remember the riots on Springwood Avenue very, very clearly.  I remember when the town was burning, and we couldn't get home.  I had to go way out of my way to get back to my home, which was on Stule Avenue in Asbury Park, because the police and the FBI agents were all over town while the town was burning on Springwood Avenue.    Ms. West: Do you remember the year that was?    Ms. Rifici: It most have been at least forty years ago. So I would say 1969, but it could have been later than that. Because I know that some of the stores that were on Springwood Avenue are not there anymore, because they burned. There was a wonderful pharmacist on the corner of Bridge Avenue and Springwood and he was there for many, many years, and they burned his pharmacy down. They burned one of the churches, one of the Black churches, I don't know.  I don't think it was St. Augustine, I think it was Mt. Zion Church. After the riots, we tried to rebuild, and we have never, never come back to the original Asbury Park that was there many years ago.  Our police chief, I remember at the time, was Tom Smith  he became our Mayor, and then he went on to become an assemblyman. He lived in my building, thank God for that.     Ms. West: You've only lived here in Asbury Park?    Ms. Rifici:  I have never lived anywhere else except Asbury Park, New Jersey.  I have been here all my life. I've seen the things come and the things go and right now we are in a very bad situation, as far as the town is concerned. But I have a feeling, a good feeling, that it is going to get better as the years go on. I hope I am around to see it.    Ms. West: Well, you have traveled around Monmouth county, though, I'm sure.    Ms. Rifici:  Oh, yes, I've been to Freehold many times.  In fact, I served on grand juries in Freehold. I've been in New Brunswick many times.  I've been in all areas of the town here.    Ms. West:  How has the county changed?    Ms. Rifici:  When you go to Freehold, I noticed that the situation there is not as dedicated as it use to be. You were able to go to Freehold at a moment's notice and get what you wanted. But now you have to go through intersections and intersections and intersections before you can get to where you are going.    Ms. West: What is in Freehold?     Ms. Rifici: Freehold is our County Seat, as far as we are concerned.  They have wonderful Freeholders, who are very generous to the city. To our city especially, and the most generous person to our city is assemblymen Tom Smith and his colleague, Steve Corodemus, who is also an assemblyman. They help Asbury Park as much as they can. And I thank them very much for it. I'm glad I'm still living here, and I hope I stay here a few more years.    Ms. West:  What important historical events have happened in your lifetime?    Ms. Rifici:  I mentioned the burning of the town. That was really bad. One thing that was very, very nice: we used to have a beautiful parade every year celebrating Columbus Day. We used to have the landing at the Boardwalk in Asbury Park for about forty five years  we had that landing of Columbus coming on his boat and all that. Well, I understand the city decided to cancel it, but there was so much outcry from the people, that they put it back on again. But it is not as well attended as it used to be.  We had fireworks going all over the place for years and years and years and that was cancelled also. So the town has been rebuilt and I don't know how they are going to do, but I wish them lots of luck.    Ms. West:  This landing: did the people wear costumes?    Ms. Rifici:  Yes, the landing was done by a gentleman called Joseph Palaia and he dressed in the Columbus era suit. He has the sailors all dressed the same in costumes. The Boy Scouts helped.  I hope the houses are much better now then they were a few years back. The development has helped a little bit. Some of the homes are in very terrible condition. But now I understand that some of the people are doing a wonderful job of rebuilding their homes. In fact, fortunately, Asbury is beautiful compared to the way it used to be a few years ago.  And most of the people who live on Freewood Avenue, who are Black people, have moved toward Fourth, Second, and Third Avenues in Asbury. They have done a beautiful job of keeping their homes up to date.    Ms. West:  How is the Boardwalk now?    Ms. Rifici:  The Boardwalk is not too great. We have the Paramount Theatre and we have the Convention Hall, which is operating, but not too great, like they used to be. And the Boardwalk hasn't done too well this year.  I know that they have had a lot of trouble at least, I would say, since July of this year.  We've had a huge barge anchored off the Convention Hall parked by the landing up by the Boardwalk to make the land larger than what it is. And so far the people are afraid to go down to the Bay, so the has been no Baying season this year. Otherwise, the Convention Hall is supposed to be repaired, and I hope they repair it soon, because that was one of the most beautiful places in Asbury, as far as skating was concerned.  Ice skating, roller-skating was all held there. Some of the wonderful stores that were there for many, many, many years are not there anymore. And I hope one day soon that they will rebuild them.    Ms. West:  Are there any rides or anything on the Boardwalk now?    Ms. Rifici:  I think there is one ride. I'm not sure if that's even activated in the summertime like it used to be. They have tried to so something. Trying to bring some of these golf courses back, which I hope they do. They tried to open some of the stores. In fact, this year was the first year that they had vendors on the Boardwalk on Wednesday and a Saturday to help the people to come back to the Boardwalk. I hope they do.    Ms. West: Do you have any keepsakes from over the years?  From Monmouth County or Asbury Park?    Ms. Rifici: Well, I tried to keep pictures of the different developments in Monmouth County: I know that they have developed quite a bit. In fact, the only objections I have that they haven't done, is that they haven't completed Route 18. That's still closed, and it has been going on for forty years. I wish they would hurry up and open it up.    Ms. West: What memories do you have of your school days?    Ms. Rifici:  I had wonderful years in the Bangs Avenue School, which used to be North.  We were the North and then the South was where the Black children used to go. Then after a while we decided we would combine them. We start integrating children back and forth. Of course, I left when I was twelve years old because Our Lady of Mt. Carmel Catholic School opened. My mother and parents wanted me to go there, which I did. Had wonderful years in Asbury and at schools. I went to the Adler Park Business College which was situated on the corner of Banks and the Railroad Station, which is now not there anymore. I didn't go to college because I had to help my parents support the other children.    Ms. West: What about the classes? Were the classes integrated?    Ms. Rifici:  No, they were not.  There were Black teachers for the Black children. There were white teachers for the white children. They did not get together.  They taught on their side and we taught on our side.    Ms. West:  What about during recess?    Ms. Rifici:  Recess was separated, too.  Then of course, I went to Mt. Carmel School, and that was different. We had Black children and white in the same classes being taught by the nuns.    Ms. West:  What books do you like to read?    Ms. Rifici: I love to read, and my favorite book is, a wonderful book by Thomas Burton. Thomas Burton has a wonderful book out about the different types of religions and how we should help other people of all nationalities, of all races. I love that book. In fact, it was put in the papers the other day, all over again.  It's time to revive it again. I think we need a lot of religion in this world today because it is gone.  I like biographies and I like the biography of Booker T. Washington, and I think they are wonderful reading for people in this day and age who do not understand what happened many, many, many years ago. And how we got to this point. This is a wonderful era and we are going into the year 2000. I hope that these younger people will understand we went on and helped. They're not doing too much helping, the younger people: they're too busy running around doing other things which are not that important to their lives. I think they should get together and help as much as we can, everybody.    Ms. West: Heroine?    Ms. Rifici: Well, my heroine was Amelia Earhart.  She was a woman flyer, a pioneer.  She was attempting to fly solo around the world.  Somewhere over the Pacific Ocean communication was lost and her plane disappeared with her many years ago.    Ms. West:  Any others?    Ms. Rifici:  Well, I don't have too many heroes.  But there were a lot of heroes and heroines. There were so many of them in the World War II.    Ms. West:  Who influenced you the most in your life?      Julia and her husband, Vincent Rifici  Ms. Rifici: My mother and father, who were of Italian extraction. They didn't take any kind of response from us, as far as answering back. In that time, I didn't think they were  doing the right thing, but they did. Because later years proved that they were right, absolutely right, and they guided my life all these years.  I didn't get married until I was sixty-seven years old when I married Mr. Rifici. My maiden name is Cesare.  I married Mr. Rifici who had been married.  He was the brother of Dr. Rifici. Then I started my married life. On top of that I inherited a stepdaughter and a stepson. My stepdaughter had three children  she died young. I raised three grandchildren up to this date, who are now twenty-five, twenty-four, and twenty-three.  At the time of their mother's death, they were sixteen, fifteen, and fourteen. I think I have accomplished a little bit by raising the children. They taught me how teenagers operate, which is a little bit different from the way we operate.    Ms. West:  Tell us more about your parents.    Ms. Rifici: My parents were immigrants.  When my father came to New York Harbor he had been working for the Italian government in Italy. When he got here, they would not accept any of the education that he had before. So he became a painter. My mother came a few months later, and they married at Ellis Island. They started their married life together and they raised seven children, and most of them were raised in Asbury Park, New Jersey.    Ms. West:  What did you do when you got sick in the old days?      Ms. Rifici:  Well, when you went to a doctor's office many, many years ago, it was not like it is today. Today they tell you to come in a certain hour and there are twenty five people there for the same hour. When you went to the doctor's office before you were the only person there with the doctor. He examined you from head to foot. Never mind working with a computer, he worked with his hands to see where your body ached and did not ache and then he prescribed. At that time, the doctor's visit was two dollars, the medicine was fifty cents. This was the time when everything was done by what the doctor said. Not by what the pharmacist said or anyone else. He gave you a prescription, you went to the drugstore, and you filled it out for a dollar. Now I don't think that is anywhere near what you pay for medicine.  The doctors were very human, and made house calls all over the place. Many, many, many years they traveled through Asbury Park and parts of other towns around here, taking care of sick people. Nowadays, you can not get a doctor to do that.    Ms. West:  What news events stand out in your mind?    Ms. Rifici:  The newspaper headline that stands most in my mind is Pearl Harbor. Being bombed at Pearl Harbor. All those many, many, many beautiful sailors who died on the Arizona, they went down with their ship. And they bombed Pearl Harbor, the Japanese, and headline was "United States Declares War On Japan."  My husband, who served in Japan, became a Sergeant  in the United States Army.  I had brothers who were with the Air Force, and I had a brother who was involved with  communications in Okinawa.  We were all filled with the war heroes and the wonderful thing I remember when the war ended were the streets of Asbury and all over Freehold and all over Avon, Bradley Beach, all over the towns here, parades going on for days. Celebrations in the streets, everybody singing, yelling, and screaming, because the war was over and the boys were coming home. I remember that very, very, very distinctly.    Ms. West:  Do you remember where you were when you got the news about Pearl Harbor?    Ms. Rifici:  Yes, I was on my way to work. My girlfriend and I were working, we were going to go to work at HL Greens at Asbury Park, which was a 5 & 10 variety store at that time, they called them 5 & 10  now they call them variety stores. As we were going to the street we heard on the radio, not the television, on the radio that the Japanese had bombed Pearl Harbor. And I said, "Where the heck is Pearl Harbor?  I never have heard of the place!"  After that we had all these people who would tell us we couldn't get out of the house at certain hours of the night. We had to go in at six o'clock and pull the dark shades down, because of the bombing they thought would happen. Which, thank God, never did.    Ms. West:  As a child what were your favorite games?    Ms. Rifici:  My favorite games were hopscotch and swing the radio and kick the can.  We used to kick the can down the street.  We used to jump rope and play jacks with a ball. Nowadays they have these wonderful Nintendo.  You don't know what is going on with the teenagers, I don't understand the half of them. But we had a very down to earth wonderful place: the playground.  We used to have gyms, the school had a beautiful playground, and Mt. Carmel School had another beautiful playground, and all the children mingled. None of this baloney about getting over here, getting over there, "you belong here,"  "you belong there," that's baloney nowadays.    Ms. West: What kind of music did you like?    Ms. Rifici: I was a very good dancer and I used to go to a lot of the dances that they had in the different communities. I really liked the Glenn Miller type of music, Tom Dorsey, of course. Many, many, many years the Convention Hall would host Tommy Dorsey Band and Frank Sinatra, who was a skinny little runt, who used to sit on the stage at Convention Hall and sing his heart away. This was many years ago. I remember all that many, many, many years back.    Ms. West:  You liked Asbury Park?    Ms. Rifici:  Yes, I did.  I had a very enjoyable time at Asbury Park.    Ms. West:  Do you have any hobbies?    Ms. Rifici: I didn't have a chance to have hobbies, because I was too busy taking care of my brothers and sisters. My hobby, I don't know, it was supposed to be going down to the Boardwalk and watching the hurricanes come.  We had terrible hurricanes. They took half of the Boardwalk away one time. We would go down there and watch this come in and, of course, we were down there when the Morro Castle burned. We watched the Morro Castle burn for at least a whole week.    Ms. West: What was the Morro Castle?    Ms. Rifici:  The Morro Castle was a pleasure ship that caught fire.  It was being towed to New York Harbor and the lines broke. It parked itself between the Astro Park and Ben's Hole in Mesheddy. It burned there for days. This was after Labor Day and the shore area was closed after Labor Day. It opened up again because this burning Morro Castle was bringing in all these people to see. It was burning for many, many, many days. I think there were 134 lives lost at that time.    Ms. West: If you could describe your life as a road map, how would you describe it?    Ms. Rifici: I would say kind of ziggy zaggy. (Laughter)  I went from there to here to there to here.    Ms. West:  What advice would you offer young people today?    Ms. Rifici:  You know nowadays the young people have an idea in mind that they should do one thing and they stick to it.  We must be open-minded and flexible as to what we want to do, because maybe what one may think is best may not be.  Be a good listener.  Learn to think first and then act whenever necessary.     Ms. West: Thank you very much for this interview. It has been very interesting.    Ms. Rifici: Thank you.     
MonmouthCounty;John Franklin Moses;1927;2000;John Franklin Moses, 1927, 2000        Remembering The 20th Century: An Oral History of Monmouth County      John Franklin Moses, present day  Date of Interview: June 20, 2000   Name of Interviewer: June West  Premises of Interview: Eastern Branch, Monmouth County Library, Shrewsbury, NJ  Birthdate of Subject: December 30, 1927    Mr. Moses: I am John Moses, and I was born on December 30, 1927 in Cheraw, South Carolina. When I was eight years old, our family moved to Long Island, where I grew up. There were seven children. I had two older sisters and four brothers. We were actually two families, because my mom and dad both were married twice. The first three children are from my mother's first marriage, but we have all grown up as one family. I went to school in Port Washington's school system.    Ms. West: Port Washington, Long Island?    Mr. Moses: Yes. After I graduated from high school, I had no intentions of going to college. I was kind of fed up with education, so to speak. But I knew something had to be done, so I did apply to a college, under the direction of my guidance counselor. I wanted to go to a college in upstate New York for Industrial Arts teacher training. All the other children went to college in South Carolina. I am the only one that went to college in upstate New York. It was right after World War II when I graduated from high school in 1946. And my application to the college in Oswego was approved. I fulfilled the written part and passed it, but I didn't know I was to appear for a personal interview in New York City.    Ms. West: What was the name of the college?    Mr. Moses: At the time it was Oswego State Teachers College in Oswego, New York. It later became a branch of the SUNY system in New York State. There were sister colleges throughout New York State, and it became one of those colleges in 1948.    Ms. West: Could you tell us what SUNY represents?    Mr. Moses: The State University of New York is what SUNY means. They just call it SUNY.    Ms. West: It's their acronym for that.    Mr. Moses: Previous to that, those colleges were the Normal Schools. Then they became Teachers Colleges, and then they became the SUNY College. I had worked for many years at the Post Office in Port Washington as a substitute clerk/carrier. During the War, I was the first Black carrier in Port Washington. I worked there as a substitute fourteen hours a day, except at Christmas time. It was eighteen hours a day at that time. So I had money saved, because I really didn't have time to spend it. I was working at the New York Racing Association as Supervisor of Parking. My guidance counselor had gone on a sabbatical leave the year I graduated, and when she returned that fall, she inquired about her former students. She called my mother to see how I was doing in college, and my mother told her that I had not gone to college. So she called the college to find out what the story was, and that's when we found out that I had not appeared for my personal interview in New York City. I supposedly was notified about it, but I never received the notice for that interview. At this time the colleges were all filled for the year. The veterans were coming home, and that took up a lot of the space, particularly at the Industrial Arts College. So she got on the phone and called one of the other sister colleges in Oneanta, New York, which had some room left. The colleges at this time did not have dormitories. You had to live in the community in private homes. Going into upstate New York as a Black person was going to be a problem. But that didn't faze her. She made arrangements for me to live with a retired professor of the College, who was eighty-one years old, and his wife. Their son was active in the College then, as a social studies supervisor. So I had this room, and I worked for the room, actually. I did light house chores for that couple, and I had the room until Christmas time. The first year courses in New York colleges were all basically the same.    Ms. West: What year did you enter college?    Mr. Moses: In 1947, in the fall. I was out of high school one year before I went into college. Because the first year was the same, there was no problem in going to Oneonta and then planning to transfer to Oswego the following year. And that is what I did. After serving my four years at Oswego, it was time now to see about a job. I finished my college work in the middle of the year  jobs were hard to come by, actually, particularly in upstate New York because of the prejudice that was still in existence rather vividly then. Most of my classmates all went to Philadelphia to work, and I didn't want to go there. I didn't want to go to any city. I had done my practice teaching in New York City only because it was convenient to be living at home. I did my practice teaching for ten weeks in New York City, and then ten weeks in Ithaca, New York. But I didn't want to be in a city. And at that time, I was also working as the Assistant to the Director of the New Student Union and Residence Hall at the college, so I had room and board and things of that nature, and I didn't have any need to rush out. I didn't go home, because I was getting room and board at the college. By doing that, I was able to take graduate courses while I was there at the college. I took a couple of courses that semester while I was still there. And then I started sending out applications for employment in the State. I evidently had a good resume.    Ms. West: What degrees do you hold?    Mr. Moses: I have a BS in Industrial Arts Education and a MA in Supervision. The MA is from Kean College here in New Jersey. Well, my resume must have looked good on paper. In those days, you didn't send photographs with your resume. That was against the law. So I sent the resume out, but I didn't get good answers from the resume. So I joined an agency in New York City who did the searching for me, and they sent my resume out. Then I was called to go on interviews. I can remember one town in upstate New York where I went to interview. With the name Moses, apparently, I must have shocked them. They were not expecting me to be a Black person. But I walked in and the interview went very nicely. Then the superintendent said to me, "Well, you have a nice resume and everything is fine. But we are looking for someone with a little more experience than what you have. "Well, I found that hard to digest because he knew my experience when he called me. He had my resume before him. Well, that was how he could get out of hiring me as a Black person. So I went on many interviews throughout the State, and I'd find one alibi after the other. So as the summer started dwindling down, I decided to just drop in a photograph with my resume so I would stop going on all those wild goose chases. And then they would know what they were getting and whether or not they wanted me. My older sister was living in Long Branch, New Jersey. She married a fellow from there that she had met in South Carolina when he was in the Army, and he moved her back here to Long Branch. She had been a second grade teacher down in Darlington, South Carolina. When she came to New Jersey, she sought employment at Fort Monmouth. As the holder of two Masters Degrees, she was proficient in English and French, and Fort Monmouth offered her a job as a carrier or clerk of some sort, which was a messenger, I believe. The job was to deliver messages back and forth. She took the job, and when she left Fort Monmouth, she was Editor-In-Chief of the unit, so that was a great improvement. Anyway, she was in New Jersey. I also had a brother living in Neptune. He came here after the War. I received notice from the agency that there was an opening in Red Bank, New Jersey, so I called about an appointment. My mother was told by people in Long Island that I was wasting my time coming down to Red Bank for an interview, because of the strong element of prejudice in the area. They thought I would just be wasting my time. But being who I was, and always being in a mixed environment, I chose to come and do the interview in Red Bank. I got to Red Bank before my papers did, and the interview with the superintendent and principal was very pleasant. He wanted to hear more about me, so he called the college to get some information about my credentials. Apparently they must have told him I was strong in discipline. I didn't know that. My discipline is what my parents brought me up with, which I knew to be right. And that was the way I felt and still feel about discipline. So he also questioned me about my high school extracurricular activities, which kind of shocked me. I expected to have that behind me. I was active in extracurricular activities in high school, like being on the Student Council and being manager of the basketball team and the football team, because I was too small to play those sports. I also refereed basketball, and I did participate in track. So he was impressed by those activities, apparently. And he told me he was going to recommend me to the board on the next night. Then he said this, "If you are hired, not only may you not be wanted by members of the community, you also may not be wanted by some of the members of the staff." And I told him that I had never had any problems mingling with people of other races. I grew up that way in the neighborhood we lived in on Long Island. And I told him all I wanted was the chance to prove myself, and I didn't foresee any problem with the race issue. And so two days later, a telegram came to the house that the job was mine if I wanted it. And I took the job as the Industrial Arts teacher in Red Bank. They told me that I was the first Black secondary school teacher in Monmouth County. I have no facts about that, but people have said that.    Ms. West: The Board of Education records show that you were the first African American high school teacher, so you must be.    Mr. Moses: Well, I don't know where they got their information, really. I knew there were elementary school teachers, but I didn't know of any high school teachers when I came into the area. So perhaps I am the first Afro-American high school teacher in Monmouth County.    Ms. West: You'll have to check a little further just to make sure where the information came from. But it is our understanding that you are the first Black, or African American…    Mr. Moses: Whatever the term is now. (laughter)    Ms. West: From what I understand, not just in Red Bank but in Monmouth County.    Mr. Moses: Yes. I know I was in Red Bank, and I understand it was in Monmouth County as well.    Ms. West: What memories do you have of high school?    Mr. Moses: Oh, I have fond memories of high school.    Ms. West: Share them with us.    Mr. Moses: I was very active in high school, and I enjoyed going to school. As a matter of fact, I didn't miss a day of school until I was in the ninth grade when they sent me home with a fever of 103 degrees. I cried all the way home, because I felt I should be in school. That was when my tonsils went bad. From that time, I missed a day here and there. But I was always in school and enjoyed being there. I was not a high academic student, by no means. I was just an average student, if that. But I seemed to have a personality that worked in my favor. So I just was active in many things.    Ms. West: When you were a youngster, did you like to read?    Mr. Moses: No, not particularly. I did not like to read very much. Now that you mention it, I remember when we had book reports. I would go to the librarian, and I would tell her I wanted the smallest, thinnest book with the largest print they had. And she would normally find something she thought I would be interested in. And she was right. She found some books that I managed to read and like.    Ms. West: Of the books that you read, was there any particular author that you liked?    Mr. Moses: No.    Ms. West: So you read because it was compulsory reading?    Mr. Moses: Yes, I did not like reading. I didn't like literature until I got in college and started getting the play writers, etc. Then I became interested in literature. Also in high school, I remember one history class. It was a World History class. I could not see any need for World History. They were talking about the Babylonians and all the ancient people and things, and I just couldn't relate with that. And I couldn't get with it. But I had one history teacher who had the habit of calling on people in the class. She asked a question, and then she would call on someone for the answer. I had figured her out. If you raised your hand, you didn't get called on. And so one day, I decided to raise my hand. I raised my hand, and right away she called on me for the answer. And I told her the answer just slipped my mind. Of course, I didn't know the answer. After class I went up to her desk and said, "Can you tell me, after all my time figuring out your system, why you changed today and called on me? You don't call on anyone who raises his hand, you call on someone who doesn't raise their hand. Today I raised my hand and you called on me." And she said, "Well, so many days you didn't seem to know the answer, and today you seemed as if you knew the answer. I thought I was going to let you shine before the class." (laughter) So you couldn't figure out the teachers, even though you thought you had. But also World History became interesting to me when I became more interested in the Bible. I was brought up in church. I began to notice in high school, that my peers, when the invitation to receive Christ and join the church was given, they would go up and be baptized, etc. At school they lived worse than I did, and I was supposed to be the sinner. They partied on the weekends and were worse than I was. And I said, "Lord, there has got to be more to this thing than what I am seeing. Please don't let me make that mistake." And He didn't. People would say, "When are you going to join the church?" And I would say, "When I understand more of what it is all about." Well, they were interested in me joining the church, the local church. But what they really were saying was when was I going to join God's church. When was my name going to go, not on the local church roster, but when was it going to go into Heaven's book? I didn't understand that exactly, because no one ever told me. It was the same when I went to college. Mother threw the Bible in the suitcase, because we always had a Bible with us whether we read it or not. So I had the Bible. Then one day, within two weeks of beginning college, a young man asked me to go to a Bible Study at lunchtime! And I thought he was crazy/ He'd be lucky if I went to a Bible Study at nighttime. But I went, because my life was geared more toward the things of God than it was in other things. So I figured I had nothing to lose. So I went to the Bible Study, and I found that group was the Intervarsity Christian Fellowship. They were working out of England and had come to the States, and they were on college campuses. And that's the group that I was working with. And I studied the Scriptures and looked at the Gospel of Saint John, and I saw Nicodemus being born again. We always learned Bible verses in the church as youngsters, so any time we had to do Bible verses, I was quick to raise my hand. But everyone was, really. We wanted to get the shortest verse in so we didn't have to do a long one. One said, "Jesus wept." And then we had to go to another verse. Then John 3:16 became one of the next verses that was used, "For God so loved the world…" And that was like a piece of poetry, so I knew it. Well, in studying the Scriptures and being ministered to by the Lord, I found that Christianity is not a religion. It is a relationship. Religion means a belief in something. And Christianity is more than that. It is a relationship between a person and Jesus Christ. And I used the sixteenth verse of the third chapter of St. John to be that relationship. I transferred it to read this way, "For God so loved John Moses…." And I included my name in that verse. I had the head knowledge, but I didn't always have the heart knowledge. So I had to move the head knowledge into my heart. And that's what I did at that time. When I went home for Thanksgiving, we had service at the church on Thanksgiving morning. I went that day and let the local body know what I had done. I went forward on the Invitation, and the Pastor and I were both crying in the front of the church. He knew what I was intending to do. I said, "When I come to the Lord, I want to serve Him the rest of my life." And that's what the Lord has enabled me to do.    Ms. West: Well, this is what you are doing now with your ministry in the prisons. Was it in Freehold?    Mr. Moses: In the County Jail, yes.    Ms. West: How long have you been doing that?    Mr. Moses: Since I retired. No, actually I have been going to the Juvenile Center for years as a teacher. As an interest of my students, I would go there. When someone would get into difficulties and be there, I would go see them. It wasn't necessarily to minister to them, but just to show an interest in them. And when they reached the age of eighteen, that's when they started going to the County Jail. And that's when I started going to the County Jail. As a Vice-Principal and a teacher in school, I would have access to the jail. They gave me full access to the inmates, to see them. But as I got ready to retire, I wondered if they would still let me in. And I liked to keep in touch with my students as much as I could. I knew the Chaplain of the jail, it was Reverend C. P. Williams, who was the Minister of the Second Baptist Church in Long Branch. I had known him for years, so he knew what my feeling was. So I called him and told him I was going to retire, and I asked what I could do to gain access to the jail to see my former students. I didn't know that this was going to lead into a ministry. I just wanted to have access to go see an inmate if I wanted to. He told me to have my pastor send him a letter, and then he would then send me a pass, which he did. I had the pass, then I went to the warden. I told him I wanted to be able to see my former students, but I asked him how I was going to know who was in the jail. And he told me it was no problem. They did a printout of who is there every day, and they would let me see it whenever I came in. Well, being a disciplinarian over the last twenty years or so at school, many of the fellows I had were in the jail. So I wasn't sure how I was going to be received by them, being that I represented authority. Well, I decided it wasn't me at all that they didn't like, it was what I represented, the authority figure that they were displeased with. So I started going. The first fellow I remember, it was fall at eleven o'clock in the morning. He came down, saw me, and said, "Are you working for the State now?" And I said, "No, I retired." And he said, "Oh, I didn't know that. Why are you coming here?" And I said, "When I told you I cared about you, I meant it. And that's why I am here, to see if there is anything I can do for you, except for giving you money." So that was him. Then another one came and said, "If I listened to you, I wouldn't be here." And I said, "You're saying that, I'm not. I wouldn't tell you that, but that is what you are saying." And then the third one was most interesting. His name was the same as a person that I had in school, but it wasn't him. When he appeared I said, "I don't know you and you don't know me." And he said, "I know you. You're that retired Principal from Red Bank." And I said, "No, Vice-Principal." And he said, "Yeah, and your name is Mr. Moses." And I asked him how he knew all this. And he said he had heard the guys from Red Bank talking. And I asked him how he could hear them talking when they were scattered in cells all over the jail. And he said, "In the yard." And I said, "What do they say?" And I expected to get shot down, with them all talking about me behind my back. And to this day, he doesn't realize how much what he said next meant. He said, "They don't know why you come, but they are glad that you do." And that gave me the incentive to continue and go on. And then it became not just seeing them, but it developed into a ministry. So I will see anyone out there that wants to see me.    Ms. West: What year was it that you retired and began this ministry at the prisons?    Mr. Moses: I retired in 1989, and I started the ministry in 1990, almost immediately.    Ms. West: And you are doing it to this day.    Mr. Moses: Yes.    Ms. West: So you never know what people are thinking and how valuable you can be to other people.    Mr. Moses: I guess. One thing I was concerned about…my dad was a real hustler. Every morning at 4:30 or 5:00 he was out and on the job. I remember my dad being sick just one day in the whole time that I knew him. Just one day he was home sick. On that day he was sick, he didn't go into work until 8:30 that day. (Laughter) That was his sick day. But my dad worked as a custodian for some building in Port Washington, and then he was the custodian in the Post Office. That's how I got into the Post Office, as a matter of fact. I started relieving him in the summer. He became sixty-five and retired, and he couldn't take retirement. He went back to work and worked until they made him retire at seventy. At that time, he developed a leaking heart valve. He was in the hospital a very short time, and I went to see him. They had to decide whether they were going to replace the valve or let him go on, because the chances were only fifty-fifty at that time of his life. So they decided to let it go. And I remember again the way the Lord worked. It was Thanksgiving Day, and I worked with the band at the high school. I was the "Assistant" to the Band Director, not in music but with the other activities of the band. (I loved music: John Philip Sousa came from Port Washington, and the "Stars and Stripes Forever" is my favorite march.) We always had a football game on Thanksgiving morning down here in New Jersey, and we played Long Branch every Thanksgiving. This particular year, my wife took my daughter and went to the Macy's Parade in New York, and I was going to go to the game later in the morning. It was raining that day, and it got worse and worse. This was the one and only game, that I know of, that they called off on Thanksgiving. Now here I was alone for the day, and I wondered what I would do. So I thought I would drive over to Long Island and see my folks and then return in time for dinner when my wife and daughter got back. That was my intent. So I left and went to Long Island. I did not know that the day before, my father had come home from the hospital. He had spent the day with my mother, and they had eaten supper together and watched television that night. (Usually they could never get together on what to watch because he always wanted to watch a ballgame or something and she wanted to watch a sitcom.) So he was there. She had a stroke five years before, and she was paralyzed on one side. And he had been taking care of her for those years. She was upstairs, and they had a bed downstairs for him in the sun porch. I didn't even know they had done that. So I walked up on the porch and looked in, and I saw the bed. And I saw the body of my father kind of lying on the bed. And I rang the bell. My younger brother came running to the door trying to quiet me, and I said, "What's the matter?" And he said, "Pop just passed." And I said, "Who is that in there? What do you mean Pop just passed?" They had just found him  he died in his sleep that night. He told my brother something the week before, when he went to see him in the hospital. He said, "I'm going home next week." We thought he was going home to Port Washington, but he meant he was going Home to Glory. And no one knew that then. When my brother brought him home from the hospital, he said, "Ride me through town." And he went down through town that one last time. And no one knew any of this until later. My mother, having had a stroke, was eating breakfast at the kitchen table when they found him. There was a hallway leading from the kitchen right out to the front door, and you could see that distance. They had just told her, and they were concerned about how this would effect her. Sure enough, she said, "Here comes my John." All her children were always "my this" or "my that." Then they became concerned, because no one had told me anything and I was not expected. And they said, "It's ok, John will be here soon." They told her, "We're on the phone to New Jersey now, and he'll be here soon." She told them, "My John is coming up the front walk right now." And I was. So that is the miraculous way that the Lord worked.    Ms. West: You mentioned your wife. Were you married when you came to New Jersey?    Mr. Moses: I met my wife in college at the Intervarsity Christian Fellowship. Out of that group of Christian people there, we became quite close. Many, many of us intermarried within the group. We got married on June 23, 1956, and I brought her to New Jersey. She didn't want to come to New Jersey. She was a pianist in a church in Liverpool, New York, while she was teaching in Syracuse. She taught two years up there. She was behind me. I had been out of college four years already. The people at the church went and found a job in a school outside of Syracuse, a job for me and for her. And they told me they wanted me to come there, because they didn't want to lose her. But I told them no, that she had to go where I went. So in 1956 we were married and came here where she taught kindergarten in Eatontown over forty years. My daughter now has three young children. She has a boy named John Moses Cross, and that's the oldest boy, who is eleven years old. He is a singer, pianist, and trumpet player and sportsman. The younger one is four years old, and then there is a three-month old girl now at this time. We've been married since 1956, and she is retiring this year from Eatontown Schools, where she is a kindergarten teacher. She taught there over forty-some years.    Ms. West: So she was an elementary school teacher?    Mr. Moses: Yes, she would only teach kindergarten. Nothing but kindergarten. And she can remember all her children today, if she sees them. Actually we had a little thing going on. Some of the Eatontown students went to Red Bank for high school, so I said she started them off, and I finished them.    Ms. West: Kindergarten makes me think of play. What games did you play as a youngster?    Mr. Moses: All the games that youngsters played. Often in the evening, in front of the house, we had little sessions of sitting around and playing games. During the day we played hide and seek, hide and switch, and all different kinds of games. We had like a little softball league in the neighborhood. Every afternoon after supper, when it got cool, we'd all go outside. There were kids of all ages, and they would choose up sides. And then we'd have a softball game in the sandlot, almost every afternoon/evening.    Ms. West: I ask all the people I interview about a game that we played during the War, and no one has ever mentioned it. Did you have any special games that you played as a child relating to the War?    Mr. Moses: No, I don't think so. I can't think of any. We played cops and robbers, and things like that. There were sandbanks and things to play in.    Ms. West: But this wasn't relating to the War. Since this is your interview, I won't elaborate on the game. But when the tape is off, I'll tell you about the game that we played in my neighborhood. And I've interviewed people who are probably in the same age bracket, and no one else has played this game.    Mr. Moses: Well, maybe I did or didn't. But I can't think of which game you mean.    Ms. West: It was a circle game that you played in the street. And the game was called War.    Mr. Moses: No, but we played dodge ball in a circle.    Ms. West: The game was called War, and it was one of the things that we played during the War. Of all the people I have interviewed, and most in our age bracket, nobody has ever mentioned that game. No one has mentioned playing kick the can, either. Did you ever play kick the can?    Mr. Moses: Oh sure, all the time.    Ms. West: Nobody ever mentioned playing kick the can.    Mr. Moses: Kick the can is one game that we played in the evening. It was dusk then, so it was easy to do that one. Sure, we played kick the can. We played Red Rover, and we played jump rope.    Ms. West: What favorite radio programs did you listen to?    Mr. Moses: I really didn't have any favorites. I remember coming home for lunch, and there would be a program on, but I can't think of the name of it. A certain time of day the radio would be on, and I'd hear certain programs like a soap opera type, I guess.    Ms. West: Did you ever listen to Jack Armstrong?    Mr. Moses: Oh, yes, the All-American Boy. I belonged to the fan club and had his ring and all his codes. And I listened to the Lone Ranger.    Ms. West: Did you have his decoder ring?    Mr. Moses: Oh, yes. And Stella Dallas used to be on in the evening. I remember hearing her a bit.    Ms. West: Well, that was a soap opera, right. Do you remember Uncle Don?    Mr. Moses: No, I don't remember.    Ms. West: Uncle Don taught the children manners like "Don't be a goop and slurp your soup."    Mr. Moses: I don't remember that. We were taught that stuff, but I don't remember learning it from Uncle Don. I was thinking of another game we played, but I lost my train of thought. It may come back to me.    Ms. West: Did you have any heroes?    Mr. Moses: I don't think so. Well, I looked at teachers as heroes. All through elementary school, especially, I was very fond of my teachers. I was what you would call the teacher's pet, maybe. I always liked to do things for them, and I would correct papers and things after school. But I didn't have any set heroes that I know of.    Ms. West: What were the medical practices at that time?    Mr. Moses: The physicians made house calls in those days. The hospitals were there, also.    Ms. West: Anyone could go to any and all of the hospitals?    Mr. Moses: I don't know about any and all, but I only know of certain ones. And they accepted everybody, yes.    Ms. West: What were the dress fads of your day?    Mr. Moses: The clothes that my older brother had. (laughter) Hair was the thing in those days. The males would have a rooster comb in the front of their hair.    Ms. West: The what?    Mr. Moses: They called it the rooster comb, because the front of your hair would be up. You would leave it longer than the rest, and it would stick up. And there were all those greases that you used to slick your hair down with the stocking caps. I don't know how they did that, but that was the thing then. The slicker it was the better you were.    Ms. West: Well, that's what they were doing.    Mr. Moses: That's right. As far as clothes, we just wore the clothes of the day. I can remember knickers and those things, and wearing out the knees.    Ms. West: Did you wear peg pants?    Mr. Moses: Nope. I would not wear peg pants. I don't think my mother would ever have let me have them in the first place.    Ms. West: What type of music did you like?    Mr. Moses: I liked all kinds of music.    Ms. West: When you were a young rebel rouser, what kind of music did you buy?    Mr. Moses: Well, I wasn't a rebel rouser, I was a gospel person.    Ms. West: You weren't into big bands?    Mr. Moses: Oh, yes, I went to hear big bands. We went to the Apollo many times, but it didn't really faze me that much.    Ms. West: You didn't go to the Savoy?    Mr. Moses: No, I don't remember going there. They would take us to the Apollo. And we went to the ballgames and things of that sort.    Ms. West: You like sports then, right?    Mr. Moses: I like sports, but I have to have a definite interest in the teams that are playing in order to get wrapped up in it. In high school I could get into their game, but I didn't care about the other sports that much. In the house my older brother was a Yankee fan, my dad was a Giant fan, and there was a Dodger fan. And there was always a fuss to get the radio. So when dad was home, he got it. We had those little rivals in the house about the different ballgames and things of that sort.    Ms. West: Who was the first President that you remember?    Mr. Moses: Roosevelt.    Ms. West: What do you remember about him?    Mr. Moses: I remember when he died. And I remember some of his sayings. I was not a political person at all, but I remember he said, "I hate war. Eleanor hates war. And Fala hates war, too." That was the dog. (Laughter)    Ms. West: They hated war, right?    Mr. Moses: Yes, they hated war. And I remember when he died, I was working in a poultry market.    Ms. West: You were just a kid at that time.    Mr. Moses: I don't know what year he died, but I think I was in high school.    Ms. West: You are the same age as one of my brothers, so you were not a little kid. Is there any particular newspaper headline that might stand out in your mind?    Mr. Moses: No. I remember Pearl Harbor on Sunday morning. And the news came trickling in. Hours later, we got the news. I look today and see the cameras on the scene, and we get it instantly now. But I remember Pearl Harbor. I was never in the War, by the way. I am the only one of the boys who wasn't in the Service. I missed that because when I was eighteen, they were drafting still. I went up for my physical the spring of my senior year in high school. I passed everything with a 1A, as they called it. And I was deferred until graduation. So that's why I hadn't planned to go to college, because I thought I was going to be in the Army. A week before graduation, they declared a draft holiday. As much as I loved my country, if they didn't need me, I wasn't going. So I didn't go. Then that summer, I contracted Bell's Palsy. It's a temporary paralysis of the facial nerves on one side. And I've had it ever since. You may notice my eye, that's Bell's Palsy.    Ms. West: Yes.    Mr. Moses: And that kept me out of the rest of the War. They would call me every six months for a recheck, because Bell's Palsy is supposed to be temporary. It comes and goes. But mine only improved to the state it's in now. But every six months they would call me for a physical. I was in college one time they called me for a recheck. And I told them to transfer me from Long Island to Oswego. But by the time the transfer was made, I was back on Long Island for the summer. So we played tag like that for awhile until one winter when they caught me in Syracuse. I was examined again, and then I didn't hear anymore. And I lost my draft card, but I didn't want to get a new one, because I think they thought I had been killed in Korea. I didn't want to stir them up, so I didn't bother getting another draft card.    Ms. West: I'm going to go back now to your days as a teacher. You were an Industrial Arts teacher?    Mr. Moses: Yes.    Ms. West: I was reading an article in the paper that was written about you. It mentioned about clubs and things that you had started in the school. Apparently the girls were omitted, but you changed that. Could you tell us a little something about how you did that in Red Bank?    Mr. Moses: Well, that's long and involved. I wanted to have an Industrial Arts Club, but I didn't want it to be just the same as a class. I wanted it to be something special. We had needs around the school, and our club started as a Stage Craft Club. We did staging. They were handpicked boys, and there were four from each grade, I believe. When I say handpicked, it wasn't like picking the cream of the crop. The reason they were in the Club was because the Club needed them, or they needed the Club. And only I knew which reason fit the individual. So I had a working nucleus, and I was working people into this Club. Once they came into the Club, they were in for life, really. Each year as they got older, they knew what activity was next, because they had done it before. So it made it very easy for me to do certain things. After the tenth year, we had a reunion every five years of Club members. We had Club reunions up to the twentieth year, which was my twenty-fifth year teaching. I can remember that night. It was a rainy night, but we had over two hundred people there, the members who came back. As I looked out over the room, it looked like one class to me. But as I think about it, many of them didn't know each other because they were from all different eras. But it was very nice. The motto of the club was "Be of service to the school and the community." The Club was all boys, because of the requirement that they had to have the course Journal Shop I, which I taught. That's where I got to know the boys. That worked until I went into the office as a Vice-Principal. I insisted on keeping the Club when I went into the office, it was called the Industrial Arts Club. After awhile in the office, they said I wasn't Industrial Arts anymore. So we changed the name. I wanted to keep the initials the same, because we always referred to it as the IA Club. So I looked in the dictionary, and the only thing I could find that would come close to that was Instant Action. So it ended up as the Instant Action Club. Now because there was no longer a requirement of taking shop first, there was no way of keeping girls out. They had the same access to the Club as the boys did, and that's how girls came into the Club. Our Club was very instrumental in forming the National Clubs during a conference in Tulsa, Oklahoma, in 1964. They gave me a ring on the twentieth anniversary of the Club. That anniversary was more like a Roast Moses dinner, rather than the Club. They had gone and purchased this ring for me. I usually sent a letter every year to the Club members. And I told them it was the last reunion I would call because it was too big, they were moving all over the place, and I could no longer keep up with them.    Ms. West: That's very nice.    Mr. Moses: So I still hear from them and see them from time to time.    Ms. West: I understand that you also received some recognition from the State?    Mr. Moses: I received a lot of awards.    Ms. West: Tell us about the awards as far as your teaching is concerned. You helped to make a big difference in the County as an educator.    Mr. Moses: The first award of importance that I got was the Jaycee Award, which is for Distinguished Service or something like that. It was awarded to an outstanding young man in the community and voted upon by the members.    Ms. West: I see the book Outstanding Young Men in America.    Mr. Moses: That was an outcome of the Jaycee Award.    Ms. West: And you are in this book.    Mr. Moses: Yes, this is the one in 1965. And that is an outcome of the Distinguished Service Award that I got from the Jaycees.    Ms. West: For the work that you have done in the community.    Mr. Moses: Yes, for my overall work in the school, community, and so forth. Most of my awards are all tied in with the community  I was active in the community. I started teaching Arts and Crafts in the summer on the playgrounds, and I taught that for about a year. And then I became the Supervisor of all the playgrounds for a few years. The Recreation Directors always told me they wanted me to come and be their fulltime Assistant. They were political jobs, and I told them they had to be kidding. I told them if they thought I was going to quit my job and become a political assistant, they were wrong. But on at least two occasions, I was the Acting Director of the Parks and Recreation of Red Bank for a year at a time. I was a member of the Zoning Board of Adjustment in Red Bank for many years, and there were so many different little clubs I belonged to. I was on the Halloween Parade and Carnival Committee and all kinds of things like that. I have been a member of the Red Bank Juvenile Conference Committee since the mid 1950s. The Board of Adjustment is an interesting committee. I was appointed by the mayor.    Ms. West: Who was the mayor at that time?    Mr. Moses: I can't remember, but there were several. I was appointed by several mayors, and that's what I am going to tell you. The committee appointment is by the mayor. What they intended, I learned later, is to school you for the council, to be a council member in their party. But I'm not a party person. I would always do what I felt was best for the people in the community, and that's the way I have been and will always be. I remember one day when we had a primary election. After school I went to the Recreation Office. The secretary worked during the day, and I would come and join her after school. One day I came in after school, and she asked me if I had voted yet. She said they came over from the "other building" and told her to go vote, and to be sure to vote the right way. I said, "Oh, did they? I wish they'd come and tell me that." So no one bothered me, because I wasn't about to be moved around to do what someone else wanted me to do. I was appointed by a Republican mayor and a Democratic mayor, as an alternate member of the Zoning Board. Well, after a few years, I started seeing people coming and going, and I was making every meeting, and they weren't. So I told them either I got appointed to a full seat on the Zoning Board or not to bother appointing me at all. So I got a full seat. I wouldn't be moved to the political aspect that people wanted, and I wasn't moving fast enough in that respect. I never wanted to be on the Borough Council, and I didn't want to have anything to do with politics of that nature. So one year I looked in the paper at the appointees, and I noticed I wasn't appointed anymore. So I called the mayor and told him he could have at least told me he wasn't going to reappoint me. And he said, "Well, you know politics." As a matter of fact, he's on the back of this paper that I'm on now. (Laughter)    Ms. West: I'll have to go home and read it.    Mr. Moses: He is on the back page, and he retired from a government position. Anyway, he said, "You know how politics are." They get the idea that people are representing people, as such. And I was never representing so-called Black people, I was representing all the people, and I happened to be Black. But they thought I should be representing the Blacks. So they got another man who was going to go into the political area, and he was a Black man, and they put him in my seat. They told me that he made no meetings at all, and he just fizzled out and didn't do anything. But I was not going to be moved by politics to do something I didn't want to do.    Ms. West: Yes, you have your principles.    Mr. Moses: Absolutely! And I would always go out and check the areas  I wasn't just a committee member. If there was going to be zoning and your property was a residential property, I would go and talk to you. I would ask you what we could do to make you more comfortable in your setting. And that's the kind of person I was.    Ms. West:What were some of your other awards?    Mr. Moses:I received the National Recreation Committee's Award for Outstanding Contributions  it was interesting to note that the same year I received the  individual award, my Industrial Arts Club received the club or group award. In 1970, I received Princeton University's Award as the Outstanding Secondary Teacher of the Year for the State of New Jersey. Then I received the Jewish Veteran's Award for Outstanding Contributions to the Community. All of these awards, I am sure, were because of the contributions my Industrial Arts Club made to the school and community.    Ms. West: If you were to describe your life as a roadmap, how would you describe it?    Mr. Moses: I'd describe it like a book that I thought about writing. As a matter of fact, there were two books that I thought about writing. One is about my life, and I may still do it if I live long enough. And the title I have for that would be similar to Rags to Riches. But that name is too common, so I have to find something that means the same thing. But that is my life. My oldest brother, who was a musician, stayed in a South teaching. He was a Vice-Principal in a Southern school even when they integrated. He was integrated into the schools down there. When he retired, I wasn't at his dinner, but someone said that he and a friend of his that he grew up with said, "You know, when we were growing up, we were poor. But nobody told us, and we never knew. By the standards of the day, we were poor. But we always had clean clothes, food, a clean bed, and we never knew we were poor." Mother used to change our clothes twice a day. And in those days, you starched and ironed things. Mother did that for all the boys every day  she kept us all neat and clean. But we were poor. And I'm still poor, by the way. I just enjoy life.    Ms. West: What would you say has been your greatest achievement?    Mr. Moses: (Laughter)    Ms. West: Nothing comes to mind? That's ok. Well what is the most unusual thing about yourself?    Mr. Moses: Perhaps my ability to get along with people. That's true. I make friends very easily.    Ms. West: In what way is your life different today than what you thought it might have been when you were a youngster?    Mr. Moses: I had no idea as to what life was going to be. I often say when I went into teaching, all I wanted was to make enough money to live on comfortably. And I haven't done that yet.    Ms. West: Oh gosh! (Laughter)    Mr. Moses: It's always a struggle, but I never intended to be rich.    Ms. West: Is there anything that you would like to accomplish that you feel you haven't yet?    Mr. Moses: There are two things that I would like to do, but I probably won't. I would like to write those two books. One would be on my life, which I think would be rather interesting. And I guess I daydream about that now. I go into my past a lot now, and I saw someplace that it is one sign of old age. But I reminisce with myself. I play piano by ear, and it's Christian music usually. And that's amusement for myself. The other book I wanted to write is about how we are letting our kids down. This subject has been written about a lot lately, and may have been worn out. It would be based on the interviews that I had with my various students down through the years. It would be how we, as adults, are letting them down, and don't know it. And that is what I would like to have done. It's a hard one to do, because I've got to do it. But I just haven't had the time to really sit down and do it. I don't sit down and do things like that very often.    Ms. West: Thinking along those lines, if you could chose a symbol to represent your life, what would that symbol be?    Mr. Moses: I guess a cross would be my symbol. My life has been pretty much geared around the things of the Lord.    Ms. West: Does the state of the world today bother you?     Mr. Moses: I don't let it bother me, I don't think. I live each day at a time, as they come. And that's what I try to do. I take them as they come.    Ms. West: Dealing with youngsters and young adults, if someone came to you for advice, what would you tell them?    Mr. Moses: It depends what they wanted, or what they needed. Every individual is different. It depends upon certain things as to what advice you could give. That is what I used to say in school. I had slogans on the wall in the back of my desk like, "My mind is not made up, confuse me only with the facts." I would tell them they had to give me the facts before I could give them advice. My advice would have no bearing and wouldn't work if they didn't. So it depends on what the facts are as to what advice would be given, as I see it.    Ms. West: When you look back and see how things were in the past, how would you like to see things now?    Mr. Moses: Look at the schools, for example. The way the children are today bothers me.    Ms. West: How do you find the children today?    Mr. Moses: Basically horrible. I could not be in my job today. They would have fired me or locked me up long ago. Much of the time, I blame this current situation on the home. If the children are not taught to respect their home, don't expect them to respect anybody else. And many of them are not made to respect home. They call their parents by their first name, and there are children having children. And that's another thing that doesn't help at all. But the attitude of the young people really bothers me. Now again, I am not speaking about all young people. Since I have been retired, if something happens, they say, "If Mr. Moses was here, that wouldn't be happening." And you can't say that if I was there things wouldn't happen, but that's the way they felt. I meant what I said, and I said what I meant, usually. And they knew that. The former administrator said that I meant business, but it was fun. There is a time and a place for everything, as in Ecclesiastes. I say that to my grandson a lot. All I have to say is, "Ecclesiastes," and he knows what that means.    Ms. West: Is there any place in Monmouth County that has any historical significance to you? Maybe besides Red Bank?    Mr. Moses: Let's take a look at the County a minute. When I first started teaching in Red Bank, they built the first cafeteria in the high school. I was on lunch duty, and they gave me this because I could do such a good job with them. And I enjoyed being on lunch duty. And sometimes I would sit down and have a sandwich with them. I always trained my classes not to do something because I am present, but to do it because it is the thing to do. And so I made myself absent a lot so that they would go on as though I were there. Too often we think we can fool around when the boss is gone. I didn't want to train them that way. In the cafeteria, in the 1950s, all the Black students would be grouped together on one side. And only I could do this, because I was Black. I walked up and said to them, "You know, if I put a sign on this table that said 'Colored Only,' you would be up in arms. But look at yourselves." I just let them know that I wanted them to look at themselves. When they complain about prejudice and integration, I wanted them to look at how they were behaving. Toward the end of the year, the Superintendent walked in and said to me, "Tell me, John, where did we go wrong?" And I said, "Dr. Hibbs, we didn't go wrong. We've done nothing wrong, and we do nothing wrong." He said, "John, what have we done wrong?" And I said, "Nothing. What we have here is lunchtime, which is free time. When you are on free time, you spend that time with the people you associate with in your own neighborhood. Until the living and housing conditions change in the Borough, you will have this problem." Well, we decided we wanted to do something more about it, so the following year we started seating them alphabetically. And the students didn't know why we were doing this. But that mixed it up, and they all became friends with each other, even more so than they would have. And that has worked out very nicely. And the housing has also somewhat changed in the Borough, which gave some improvement to that, too.    Ms. West: Can you explain how housing has changed?    Mr. Moses: At the time, there were two basic areas that the Black people lived in. There was the west side and a section on the extreme east side. Those were the only areas where you had Black people. That has changed, and people have spread out. But before that, I wanted to find another house. My little bungalow was getting too small, and I wanted to get another place. I wanted to stay in Red Bank because my activities and things were in Red Bank. So I would look in the paper and find a house, and if I saw something I liked, I would drive by and see if I liked the outside. There was no sense going inside if I didn't like the outside. I found one house that I wanted to look further at. I called the number, and the person called me back. After he found out that I was Black, he told me the house was no longer on the market. And I told him that was kind of strange. And he happened to be a Councilman, and that made it even worse to me. So I moved out of the Borough eventually, to Tinton Falls. There was no place that I could find that I wanted in the Borough. And I had another episode with race in the Borough, and it was on the First Aid Squad. In the 1960s you had to be a fireman first in order to be a first aid man. And I was interested in becoming a first aid person. I had a receiving radio in my car that somebody made for me when I was the Supervisor of the playgrounds, so I would know if anything was going on when I went from playground to playground. I would often hear the ambulance calls. They had eventually separated the firemen from the first aid, and you could be a first aid person without first being a fireman. So I thought I might like to try that and be of assistance in the Borough. I set out to do that, and I found out that I was Blackballed from getting on the first aid squad. Well that disturbed me, because I was often telling the young men at school how they should become active in the community and not just hang on the street corner, etc. So I went to the Council. If I had known then what I learned that night, I wouldn't have gone. I thought the firehouses were owned by the Borough, and that the Council had some jurisdiction over them. Well, I came to find out that the firehouses were basically owned by the firemen associations, and the Borough had nothing much to say about them, except they gave them contributions. So that attempt didn't work. And I told them that it was a shame, because I had certification as a Red Cross teacher. And at that time, the people on the squad had to have a refresher course each year given by a person certified to give that, which I could do. Being the person that I am, and knowing a lot of people, this refusal tore up families because they were in dispute over whether or not I should be allowed to join. One man asked his friend, "How would you like to go to a clam bake and have your wife dancing with him?" Little did they know that I wasn't interested in clam bakes or any of the socials, because I had no time for those things. I was just interested in serving as a first aid person. But I was not chosen. But now they have come a long way, and they have Black men on the fire department and first aid squad.    Ms. West: Do they have their own?    Mr. Moses: No. They are mixed in with the others.    Ms. West: They are mixed in, very good.    Mr. Moses: After I tried to join and could not, I was at once a football game and heard the first aid squad over the radio. I heard, "Red Bank first aid squad, first call." Then I heard the second and third calls, but they couldn't get anybody to respond. And sometimes they would have to call people from another district, and all because they refused to let those who wanted to serve, serve. So I guess they got pressured, more or less, by lack of manpower to allow Blacks to participate. And now they do.    Ms. West: It's just a shame what things had to come to.    Mr. Moses: As far as being accepted in the school, I never… The Superintendent again came by the end of my first year there, and he said, "Thanks for a fine job well done." And I told him that if there was anyone who didn't want me there, he did a fine job of concealing it. I didn't go looking for trouble, and sometimes if you don't look for it, you don't see it.    Ms. West: Before they built the new high school in Red Bank, what was the ratio of whites to Black in your high school?    Mr. Moses: I don't know what the ratio was, but it is the same as now. It hasn't changed. Red Bank supplies a large number of Black students, and as a matter of fact, at the time there were no Black students in either Shrewsbury or Little Silver. Maybe there was one family, and that was all. And that has also changed. Blacks are living in those areas as well.    Ms. West: What else would you like to tell us?    Mr. Moses: One thing was interesting to me. The students had sit-ins, and people were demanding different things. Some of the Blacks wanted to have some demands, as well. So one day, they walked out of the school. I remember being near the door when they were walking out. And one said to me, "Are you with us, Mr. Moses?" And I said, "I'm with you when you are right. But I represent all the children of all the people. I can't just side with one group because they decide they want to do something." I told them if they would just let me know what they wanted, we could go about it a different way, instead of making demands. When demands are made on some people, they just freeze up. And you can get the same thing without making demands. So they started working that route, pretty much.    Ms. West: What are some of the major changes that you have seen in this country over the years?    Mr. Moses: I have seen the integration take place in the South. And another thing that would be interesting to note is that I am the only member of my family who went to school in the North. Everyone kids me about that, because I didn't want to go in the South. The reason they went to school in the South originally was because my grandmother lived in the college town. They could go and establish residence with her and save on tuition. By the time I came along, my grandmother had passed on. So there was no need for me to follow that route. So I went up North. But everyone talks about the prejudice of the South, and how you can't do this or that. In the North, I found the prejudice is worse, in many instances, because it is hidden. It is under cover, and it shows up at different times and in different ways. If I went to a hotel and walked up to the desk to get a room, I would not get a room. This was in New York State, and it was because I was Black. So what I had to do all through the years was to prearrange, pre-register, and pre-pay. Then, when I walked in with a reservation, they couldn't deny me a room. And that was the case in the early days, but that no longer happens. As a matter of fact, they cater to me. I used to take boys up to a conference in my college town in upstate New York once a year. The boys were amazed that I would pull up, after driving 400 miles or so, at the motel. But I had already made the reservations. And the person would say, "How are you, Mr. Moses? Did you have a good trip?" And the boys couldn't understand how I could be called by my name that far away. But they didn't like high school kids in hotels, because they would break things or take things. But I told them that I was with the students I brought, and I guaranteed them that there would be nothing taken out of that room, because I was staying in the room with them. So after the first time, I had full access to the facilities. They then knew we would take care of their facilities. Again, I don't look at color. I was Black and bringing Black people with me, but we were accepted.    Ms. West: You have to be realistic.    Mr. Moses: Yes, right.    Ms. West: You were the first Black, or African-American teacher in the County and in Red Bank High School. How many Black teachers are there now?    Mr. Moses: I don't know. Let me say this to you about being the first Black school teacher. I was shortly elected as the Vice President of the Teacher's Association for Red Bank. Within a month of my serving as Vice President, the President died. And then I was made the President, and I served as President over seven years.    Ms. West: So you were the first Black President of the Association, as well.    Mr. Moses: Oh, yes. I only got out when my doctor told me about my health, and I was getting into too many things. And my doctor was a Black board member. So I resigned as President, and they put me on the Welfare Committee. It is a negotiating team, and it was more work than being the President. But I didn't notice any prejudice towards me as a person or towards Black people. I know the Superintendent of Schools in Long Branch now. He was my student. And I can remember some of the guidance counselors thinking that person wasn't going to make it, and there was no sense in him going to college. And they did that with a lot of people. But things didn't always work out the way they thought they were going to work out. I was talking to him just a few weeks ago about that. He is Argentinean, but he was of a different background and did well.    Ms. West: So you never know. Lots of times when people try to discourage you, they are really encouraging you.    Mr. Moses: And I told my students that I was often considered being prejudiced towards the Black students. And I said maybe I was harder on them than I was on the white students, without knowing it. I told them they had to be better than the other person in order to get the best job. I told them to work to capacity and do the best that they could.    Ms. West: What is your greatest strength?    Mr. Moses: The Lord is my greatest strength.    Ms. West: What are your greatest values?    Mr. Moses: I don't think along those lines. I don't look at strength as such, I just do what needs to be done. I know I am learning to say no. I always tried to help whenever I could. But I have learned to be a little more prudent with my yes's and nos. And I have had some health problems, too, down through the years. So I have to be a little more careful. Here's another change. Years ago, our band started having exchange concerts with another band. We would go to their school for two or three days, and they would do the same. When they did this, the students lived with the other students. That's the only way we could afford to do this. The students lived with other students, and the chaperones stayed in a motel. They only went North to Pennsylvania, New England, and places like that. I often wanted to have an exchange concert with my brother's band in South Carolina. And of course that was an all Black situation, and that was almost impossible to even think about. By the time we started going to the South, he was gone. He wasn't dead yet, but he was in another position.    Ms. West: And the school sponsored this program?    Mr. Moses: Yes.    Ms. West: That's interesting. That's nice.    Mr. Moses: I don't know if they still do it or not. But the band was invited to go to Disney World three times, and to several World Fairs. And they went to the Yankee Stadium. I remember when I went with the band the first time we went South over land. I had flown over Carolina  I flew to Disney World with my daughter, when she was about five years old. When I was about seventeen years old, my younger brother and I were going to go South to visit my sister and brother. We were going to go down by train. They put us in the Jim Crow car in Penn Station, New York, so we would not have to make any changes at Washington. Years ago you rode in any car you wanted to from New York to Washington. But when you got to the Mason Dixon Line, you had to change to the segregated cars. So we were in the segregated car already, so we wouldn't have to make the change in Washington. I didn't notice much difference, really, except that the coal from the train would come in that car. That's why it's the first car. The car behind the engine is the one that the Blacks rode in. We went down fine, and then we had some time in a town. And the station had signs all over that said "Colored" and "White." We went to get a bus ticket at a drugstore, and the drugstore was on a corner. We went in the main door of the drugstore, and we walked through the store to the back of the store where they had the bus tickets. We got there, and the man said, "You are from up North, aren't you?" And we asked how he knew that. And he said, "Because you are supposed to come in that door right there." You were supposed to come in the side door so you didn't walk through the store and bother anything. So I thought we had better get out of there. And then we went to a movie, and we were put in a balcony. And I thought that was strange, because normally you would have to pay more to get in the balcony. I thought that was strange that all the Blacks were put in the balcony, and I thought it would be easy to hurt somebody and just throw some bricks over and get a few of them. But then I figured that wouldn't work because they would kill everybody up in the balcony. (laughter) Then we went to the station to take a train, and the train came in. There was practically no room in the Black car. To my surprise, they moved the people out of the second car back further, and opened the second car to the Blacks. We got into that car, and then I noticed the difference. The seats in that car were plush, like you would have on a touring bus. But the seats in the Black car were leather seats, like you have in a school bus. That was the difference in the seating on the train. Then we came back, and I thought I better get out of there before they found something I did wrong and lynch me. My daughter was in college in Lynchburg when I took her one time I decided to go on down to South Carolina to see my brother. I told him to tie everything down because I was coming like a tornado to South Carolina. So I spent the weekend with him, and there were no problems. When our band went to Durham, North Carolina, the students stayed with different people. They tried to group as much as they could, but you couldn't always group them into Black and white.    Ms. West: How did the students react to separating the Blacks from the whites in the South?    Mr. Moses: They only separated some of them where they were living, to make them more comfortable. The place where my daughter and another girl was, was not a good house at all. They stayed one night there, and then we didn't let them go back there. We took them to the motel with us. We told them to tell the people they were sick, and they were sick…sick of the mess they were in. After that, they went down to Orlando.    Ms. West: The white youngsters, never experiencing something like that before, did they have any reaction of any kind?    Mr. Moses: It wasn't really that bad, and there weren't that many of them, anyway. I don't recall any problems.    Ms. West: Well hearing about something is one thing, and seeing it is another. So I just wondered what their reaction was when they saw it firsthand.    Mr. Moses: There was nothing they could do. They felt terrible about it, and sometimes we wouldn't go to a place where they had segregation. Well, it worked out well and was a good education for all of them to see what happens. There are places where a Black person goes to a restaurant with a group of white people, and they won't serve the Black person, so they all leave. I never had any problems with that in my moving around.    Ms. West: How did you find things here in the County?    Mr. Moses: Only with the housing, that I told you about. I didn't notice anything else. However when I came, Long Branch had just integrated the school. It was in the 1950s, as I understand. The school on Liberty Street had just become integrated. It used to be the primary Black school because it was located in the Black section. And they had you by your district. And that's another interesting thing to know, the regionalization of the school. Red Bank became regionalized in the high school, ninth through twelfth grade. The districts from Little Silver and Shrewsbury sent their students to Red Bank on a tuition basis. And because they were so close together, there was a great deal of talk about regionalizing on a K-12 basis, all the way, which would cut expenses down, etc. Well, the other districts weren't too keen about that, because the neighborhood kids would have to be bused to another area, just to integrate them sooner. And they wouldn't do it. As a result, they are waiting on regionalizing it in the ninth grade. The white students coming in from the other districts are made to be very fearful of the Blacks from Red Bank, because that's the way it is talked up. And so extortion can often take place because you are expecting it. If those kids were allowed to go to school together at an earlier age, they would be totally friendly with each other. Kids don't know anything about their color. And that reminds me about something else. When I was a mail carrier in Port Washington, I walked up to a door and a two year old said, "Mommy, mommy, we have a chocolate mailman today." And she was embarrassed, but the kid was only saying what she knew. I was brown, and brown was chocolate to her. I felt sorry for the mom because she was embarrassed. A few days later, the exact same thing repeated itself, except this child said, "Mommy, we got a nigger mailman today." And that's when I began to really see that children go by what they are taught. They had to be taught to say something like that. The first child was being natural, but the other was taught that Black represented "nigger."    Ms. West: Well, it was a sign of the times. It was unfortunate, but that was life then.    Mr. Moses: Some people didn't like my carrying their mail. One man called the post office and told them he didn't want any kid bringing his mail around. He said, "If that kid that brings the mail around is a day over twelve, I'll eat my hat." And the Supervisor said, "Would you like mustard, or salt and pepper on your hat? The kid who brought your mail today is an eighteen year old high school graduate." So that kind of stopped him. Is there anything else you can think of to get me started again?    Ms. West: I'm looking here to see if I missed anything.    Mr. Moses: Churches were very much, and still are, segregated. The most segregated time in America is 11:00 a.m. Sunday morning. I can remember when my wife was appointed to the Board of Education in Red Bank. She was appointed to fulfill a term. Then she decided to run for another term. We had belonged to an integrated church, and we still do. This person came up the street and said to her, "Now, if you want to win the election, you better get out and start campaigning in the churches." And my wife told her she wasn't running for the election on a popularity basis or because of color, and church was not the place to campaign for an election. The idea of the old church being used for everything by the Blacks is still very much in effect in many places. The church was the only place they had for a meeting place, so the church wasn't just a religious place. That was the only place where they could do anything. A lot of places won't drop that. Anyway, we didn't change any of our habits, and it was very strange how the election came out. She won! But not in that district. She did not win the Black district.    Ms. West: Really!    Mr. Moses: Some people are geared toward a certain color. And if you don't do something, then you are no good. And you can do just as good for them without segregation. As a matter of fact, I hate segregation in any form. But a lot of it we do ourselves.    Ms. West: Is there anything else you want to say?    Mr. Moses: I can't think of anything.    Ms. West:I know the library has appreciated everything that you have told me this morning. If there is anything else that we can think of, please mention it.    Mr. Moses: I just can't think of everything that happens, but I hope I have discussed some of the things you might be looking for.    Ms. West: Thank you very much.   
MonmouthCounty;Judith Stanley;xxxx;2000;Judith Stanley, xxxx, 2000          Remembering The 20th Century: An Oral History of Monmouth County      Judith Stanley, 1997  Date of Interview: June 21, 2000  Name of Interviewer: June West  Premises of Interview: Mrs. Stanley's home, Red Bank, NJ  Birthdate of Subject: N/A    Ms. West: Mrs. Judith Hurley Stanley is the chairperson of many charitable organizations in Monmouth County. She is known for her expertise in community affairs, and her success on the boards of many institutions. Please comment on that, Mrs. Stanley.      Judith Hurley Stanley receiving a swimming trophy  Mrs. Stanley: I probably acquired from my mother and my grandmother the desire to do well. My mother worked in New York as an advertising executive with J. Walter Thompson, and she commuted daily. I lived in Asbury Park and West Allenhurst, and I went to Asbury Park High School. In high school I was a cheerleader and headed the yearbook. You know, I did as many things as I possibly could do because I was interested in being involved. I swam at the Allenhurst Beach Club  I was quite a swimmer in those days. I graduated as the valedictorian from Asbury Park High School and then went on to Smith College in Northhampton, Massachusetts, where I spent the next four years studying history and received my BA in history. I married, as it was the custom then to marry quite young and have children. It was for that reason that you were educated.    I did not go to work permanently, although I had a few part-time jobs. Actually, when I was in college, I worked at Steinbachs in the sports department. I was married in 1955 to Hans Anthony Huber, who was a graduate of Amherst. Since at that time men had to go in the Army, we moved out to Colorado. I did have a job there part-time writing for a paper. Also, before I left for Colorado, I had worked for a little while in the Asbury Park school system as a substitute teacher. After the army stint, I proceeded to have four girls. My children's names are Lisa, Shelley, Andrea, and Catherine. One of them still lives near me with my two grandsons. We lived in Middletown first, on Brown's Dock Road, and now on Navesink River Road. During this time I became involved in different charities. My first was what was then called MCOSS, for Monmouth County Organization for Social Service, now called the Visiting Nurse Association of Central Jersey. I started serving on that board in 1964, and I became its chairman from 1977 to the present. When I took over it was about a two and a half million-dollar operation, and before Medicare cuts in 1998 its budget rose to about eighty-five million dollars. I then joined the Monmouth County Historical Association Board, and I now serve as its president. In 1977, with my husband Bob Stanley and others, I founded the Monmouth Conservation Foundation, and I still serve as its president. In 1976, I went on the Planning Board in Middletown and became its chairman in 1981. I still serve in that post.    After that period, I entered into many other areas. I've been on the Monmouth University Board, Stevens Institute of Technology Board, and then, probably because my second husband, Bob Stanley, was interested in politics, I branched into politics. I served as a County Committeewoman for a long time and as chairman of the Monmouth County Republican party and as delegate to five Republican conventions. I now also serve as the Republican National Committeewoman for the state of New Jersey.    One of my biggest interests is in trying to preserve what there is left of Monmouth County and New Jersey. Monmouth was the most beautiful county when I was growing up. I remember when there wasn't even a Parkway, you just drove up Route 35 or Route 34. Of course we had the shore, beautiful streams, and working farms. It was absolutely magnificent. At present, I also work hard for various healthcare organizations. I serve on the board of Monmouth Medical Center, where my husband served as the chairman for sixteen years. I am now connected with the Count Basie Theater. I serve on the State Council of the Arts, which gives money to the different arts organizations in the state of New Jersey. I can't remember all the things I have done, but these are some of the highlights. I do care a great deal about Monmouth County and New Jersey. I have been part of its history for a long time.    Ms. West: Such as…    Mrs. Stanley: Well, you know, just the growing up here. I remember Asbury Park when it was also beautiful. I have seen the growth of many good things, along with the not-so-good.    Ms. West: Were there any specific people in Monmouth County who had a great influence upon your life?    Mrs. Stanley: Well, my grandfather was an important part of the fabric of Asbury Park and my mother was connected with a lot of people. Supreme Court Justice Hayden Proctor was a part of my life, and his daughter was my best friend growing up. I have known many different people during the many years—governors, legislators, judges, and other well-known citizens. I hope that I'm known for the good, not for the bad.    Ms. West: Is there any particular area in the Monmouth County historically that has a great significance to you?      Judith Hurley (Stanley) on the beach, August 1937  Mrs. Stanley: Well, probably Asbury Park. I think you're always attached to where you were born and where you grew up. As I said, I can remember when it was beautiful, when you went to the theaters and they were all lovely. You could walk downtown without fearing for anything. I would like to be a part of the renaissance if it ever happens. There were many other parts of the County that I remember. I remember the wonderful Farmer's Market that they used to have in Neptune. I used to go there with my grandparents, and it went on for miles and miles  you never saw so much fruit and vegetables in your entire life. And that is, of course, what Monmouth County was famous for.     Ms. West: When you were going to high school, could you tell us a little about your high school days, what stands out in your mind?    Mrs. Stanley: Well, I guess I went up in the attic one day in my grammar school days, and pulled out my mother's report cards. Thus was born my determination to beat her. My grandfather had been president of the Board of Education of Asbury Park for twenty-five years and under his tenure the Asbury Park High School and the stadium were built. In high school, I tried out for everything. I was a cheerleader, and I did all the sports that I could. I edited the yearbook, and worked in the office, and was head of this club and that club. I thoroughly enjoyed my high school years.    Ms. West: What would you say is your greatest achievement at this point?    Mrs. Stanley: I suppose your greatest achievement is always your children and your family, but my other achievements have been being a leader in the community and making sure that good things happen for the community. That really is my drive. It may sound supercilious, but I derive a lot of pleasure from making things happen and being able to know the right people to call to make those things happen.    Ms. West: Is there anything unusual about yourself, would you say?    Mrs. Stanley: No, I'm just sort of a plain everyday sort of person. I think I did receive a good education at Smith College, and that has served me well. As a result, I like reading, particularly history. I also like traveling and my garden.    Ms. West: You say you like reading  do you have a favorite author?    Mrs. Stanley: Do I have a favorite author? Well, I love biographies, particularly history. I think the best book that I've read recently is by Edith Wharton, called Summer. So I don't usually pick up the latest book, but tend to read the books that I've heard about through the years and have even read as a child and as a young adult. I tend to read them again.    Ms. West: Were you a great reader as a child?    Mrs. Stanley: Yes. I was a good reader as a child. I had the example of my mother, and of course, my grandfather. My grandmother also, because she did take me on four trips to Europe, so through her, I saw and learned a great deal.    Ms. West: Give us your grandmother's name, so we'll know who the lady is.    Mrs. Stanley: Her name was Bessie Hurley. That name was popular back when she was born  I guess she was supposed to be Elizabeth, but somehow the minister talked her parents into Bessie.    Ms. West: Well, looking at your life today, and reflecting back as a child, has it turned out as you thought it was going to be? Did you have any aspirations in any particular direction when you were younger?    Mrs. Stanley: Well, when I was younger, I guess my big aspiration was to study a year in France and learn French, but then when the time came I stayed here and studied in the United States, although I have always been interested in conquering another language.    I had my disappointments  my divorce was one. But then I was fortunate enough to marry Bob Stanley, who was well known in the community, and who also helped me to raise my children. He taught me a lot, as I have said, about politics and working for charities. Unfortunately, he died at the age of sixty-five, and that was back in 1985. I really have continued to pursue most of the things that he was comfortable in doing. I still remain in our house, and I love this house. I do love to entertain, not only for my friends, but also for my charities. And for politics, yes I do like to help the right people win. I was a big Christie Whitman supporter, a big Tom Kean supporter. So I do have a lot of parties here. I actually had Newt Gingrich here at the house, and I've had many other Congressmen here.    Ms. West: Being a part of the Nurse Association, and looking at medicine, how was medicine when you first became involved and how is it today? What changes have taken place, and what things may you have been responsible for?    Mrs. Stanley: I've mostly been responsible for the growth of the agency, because the medicinal part is done by the staff in conjunction with doctors. Nurses can't do anything unless doctor's orders are signed. I think what I'm proudest of there is the fact that we are totally a community organization  our hospice program is famous because it's so hands-on, and because we go into the homes. Because we go into the homes, we’re not maybe as well known as a hospital. We do have two buildings here in Red Bank, and four other locations. We try to reach out always to serve more people. We receive grant money, and have been the forerunner of many things, such as serving residents in boarding houses and motels. We've always been on the cutting edge of things that have happened in health care.    Ms. West: Well, you've done so much, you are doing so much, is there anything else that you would like to add?    Mrs. Stanley: Well, there's always more to do. I'm known to be very energetic and work hard to help people. So I never know what new door is going to open. I will continue to do the things that I'm doing now, although I always want to see my children and grandchildren. I have five grandchildren, two grandsons here. My three granddaughters are in Charlotte and I'm extremely proud of them and the fact that they are all so bright and well rounded.    Ms. West: How old are your grandchildren?    Mrs. Stanley: Our first, of course you never forget your first, Anna, is twelve years old now. Then we have Merrill, who is nine, and she's a beautiful girl and a great runner. And then we have Bobby, my first boy ever, who is the grandson here. He will be seven. And then I have two who are just about the same age, and they are my granddaughter Ellie and my grandson, named Tad.    Ms. West: And now, here again, thinking about all the things that you have done and are doing, if you had to pick something that would symbolize your life, what symbol would you pick?    Mrs. Stanley: Somebody said, "You're always in the newspapers," although not always happily, particularly during my days with the Garden State Parkway. I believe I was a good Chairman who championed the arts, a clean road, and happy employees, and I have a great dedication to New Jersey. So those were five very busy years of my life. There's always a lot more I can do, I suppose. The jewel in my crown would be to see Asbury Park revitalized.    Ms. West: With the county as a whole, disregarding the shore area, what other changes would you like to see?    Mrs. Stanley: Less traffic and more open space, which is hard to achieve considering the law of the land. I despise that everybody is chasing ratables, because the ratable chase really leads to a rat race that causes more traffic and asphalt, higher taxes and the loss of state aid. I would like to see regional planning take place. I'd like to see a state plan become effective, and I'd like people to be aware that they can have an impact in helping to save our county and state.    Ms. West: What are your greatest values?    Mrs. Stanley: Honesty. In fact, I'm probably too honest, people tell me. I also guess the fact that I'm energetic. I am moral. I am not terribly religious, but I do believe in God, and I am a Christian. I tried to raise my children that way, too.    Ms. West: Considering the state of the world today, how do you feel about things?    Mrs. Stanley: Well, politics unfortunately is in everything  it's in every single walk of life - and that's why you have to get to know people if you want to get things accomplished. Politics, per se, no, it doesn't excite me, but I know that you have to be there in order to make things happen. I've seen the change in politics, and not for the better. I certainly was not very proud of our past president. I think that he did great damage to the United States. And I think that our congressmen and people should uphold more tradition and values. I also am pro choice, and very pro women. I think it's a woman's right to have control over her body. Because I have four daughters, I feel adamantly about that.    Ms. West: What would you say will be your legacy to your children and your grandchildren?    Mrs. Stanley: I hope that some of them will try to give back to the community the kind of things that I have given back to the community. And the ones who live in Monmouth County will carry on and try to keep Monmouth County beautiful. I hope they will also try to respect tradition.    Ms. West: What if your grandchildren or their friends came to you and asked you for some advice, what advice would you give them? What words of wisdom?    Mrs. Stanley: I don't know about words of wisdom. I would tell them to study hard, to make the best of their schooling because that is what you lean on when you get older. If you have that education, you're a very, very fortunate person. So I think study and learning is important, and I think being honest and honorable is important. I think giving back to your community is important. And helping others is important. People do come to me for personal advice, and I'm always glad when I can help them, whether it is through the hospital, or through the VNA, or whatever it may be, I like to help people.    Ms. West: You've been so busy, and you've said so much. Now this new millennium is in its infancy, so we have to look ahead, not backwards. How would you like to see things become, what would you like to see happen?    Mrs. Stanley: I would like to see respect and tradition restored. We can't give up on what was the past because it is from the past you learn about how to conduct yourself in the future. I would like to see a focus on better values. I think there's too much emphasis on the big house, the fast money, and the crassness of the power of money. I do not see that as a good thing for the future.       Judith Hurley Stanley,   Christmas, 1940  Ms. West: Speaking of fads and dress codes, what was the dress code in your day?    Mrs. Stanley: The dress code in my day was bobby socks and saddle shoes, or the loafers with the penny in it  then you had the longer skirts and the sweater buttoned backwards and the dickey with your name on it. The code in college was pretty much the same. Since, I've lived through the real short skirt and the mini skirt. I am a little old for the mini skirt these days. I have to say that I do like slacks because they are very comfortable. But there are certain times when you just simply cannot wear slacks, so I do believe in a dress code. Even though we did have our own sort of uniform growing up, it was a very neat uniform.    Ms. West: Well, your mentioning bobby socks made me think of Frank Sinatra. What type of music did you like?    Mrs. Stanley: Well, my best friend liked Frank Sinatra, and I liked Bing Crosby. I love the way he sings and I still watch his movies today, and I guess he was my very favorite movie star. Certainly I loved the stars and loved the movies. We had these wonderful movie theaters in Asbury Park so I remember them well.    Ms. West: Do you remember the first movie that you ever saw?    Mrs. Stanley: You know I really don't remember the first movie, I just remember that I would go to the movies with my grandparents, and then with my friend on Saturdays, for thirty-five cents. We would have to watch the "Eyes and Ears of the World" where they showed our soldiers washing up on the beaches. Maybe the first movie I saw was Snow White or Bambi, because I do remember crying like mad all during Bambi.    Ms. West: Mentioning the War, and I assume you are speaking of World War II, is there any particular headline that stood out in your life?    Mrs. Stanley: Well, Asbury Park was a great part of the War because of the submarines that were off the coast. We had to have shades at night, and we had air raid wardens, so Asbury Park was quite a part of the War. Also, the British Navy was at the Berkeley Carteret during the War. We had Fort Monmouth here, we had Fort Dix. I remember going down there and seeing the prisoners, I believe they were the Italian prisoners then. And, yes, during the War, rubber shoes were rationed, and you had to eat oleo instead of butter. I maybe had a Coca Cola once a week or cookies once a week. We just didn't have the choice of food that children have today. Gasoline was rationed, so you could only drive your car a certain number of miles. I also remember the Yankees being here, at the Asbury Park High School Stadium.    Ms. West: Did you have a favorite radio program?    Mrs. Stanley: I listened to all those soaps growing up, "Young Widow Brown," "Front Page Farrow," "Stella Dallas," I mean all of them. I loved them and I liked nothing better than being sick and staying home and listening from eleven to twelve and three to six p.m. But then I grew out of that, and went on to the General Electric Theater on Monday nights. My grandfather loved Jack Benny, so I remember listening to that. On Sunday night there was also "Inner Sanctum."      Judith Hurley Stanley (right), 1942  Ms. West: Is there anything else you'd like to say to us?    Mrs. Stanley: No, I'm just very proud of this area, I'm proud of being born here because it is so beautiful. I've had and have so many wonderful friends from here. I hope to continue to make friends, across the state and throughout the country, because as national committeewoman I do go and meet other people from other states.    Ms. West: Well, I appreciate you talking with us this morning.    Mrs. Stanley: Thank you.    Ms. West: It was a pleasure meeting you and speaking with you.    Mrs. Stanley: Thank you very much.  
MonmouthCounty;Josef and Bea Bienstock;1921;2000;Josef and Bea Bienstock, 1921, 2000        Remembering The 20th Century: An Oral History of Monmouth County      Mrs. and Mr. Bienstock, present day  Date of Interview: June 12, 2000  Name of Interviewers: Flora Higgins and Douglas Aumack  Premises of Interview: Monmouth Country Library, Headquarters, Manalapan, NJ  Birthdates of Subjects: Bea Bienstock- April 9, 1922                         Josef Bienstock- September 12, 1920    Ms. Higgins: Good morning to you both. I am glad you came for this interview. Can you tell me a little bit about how you ended up in Howell?     Ms. Bienstock: My husband's family bought the farm in 1942. From 1943 to 1946, my husband was in the service. We were married in 1944, but he was overseas all that time. When he came back, we rented a house nearby, near the farm. After a couple of years, we were able to buy the house we are in now. And we have been there since 1946.    Ms. Higgins: Your parents were from here, too?    Mr. Bienstock: No. I was an immigrant. I immigrated to the United States in 1941.    Ms. Bienstock: From Germany.    Mr. Bienstock: Yes, from Germany. Actually I think I left Germany in 1938 to go with my parents and my sister, and then after some wanderings, we arrived in the United States in April 1941. My parents had difficulties in getting established. We came to New York, but first we lived somewhere else. My parents were fortunate enough to bring along some money, and that tided them over for the first few years, as well as helped them buy the farm. In Germany, my parents had been in the men's clothing manufacturing business and really had no background in farming. However they had good business sense and saw that the farming business could provide them with an independent living. Very shortly after we got here, we found some friends and relatives who were in the same area. They were also in Howell, and they were in the chicken business.    Ms. Higgins: Do you remember their names?    Mr. Bienstock: Yes. Mr. Stang.    Ms. Bienstock: There were about a thousand chicken farms in Monmouth and Ocean Counties at that time.    Mr. Bienstock: And it was the type of business that you could get into with relatively little capital. As I said before, my parents had some money, and that helped them to get started. But also they got a mortgage from the Federal Land Bank and also a second mortgage from the Jewish Agricultural Society. This was very helpful in getting established. Not only did the society lend them money, but they also assisted in teaching my parents and myself about the chicken business. We had absolutely no background in the chicken business. As a matter of fact, I was selected to spend the summer of 1942 with the Stangs, and in those four or six weeks, I became an expert in raising chickens. In August 1942 my parents got title to about five acres and established the business. The most important thing was when we walked in, we could make a living immediately. So anyway, that bought us a house.    Ms. Higgins: I see. We have interviewed other chicken farmers from that period, and it was apparently a good business.    Ms. Bienstock: It wasn't that lucrative, but it was steady.    Mr. Bienstock: What was attractive was that you did make a living. But it was more attractive that you were your own boss. You didn't have to work for anybody else. The feed was bought through a cooperative. None of these things were on a contract basis. We had to purchase our feed, because we didn't grow anything. We had to buy everything to feed the chickens, which was done through a cooperative. The name of the cooperative was the Jersey Farmers Cooperative, which was in Hightstown and is no longer in existence.    Ms. Bienstock: Well, none of this is in existence today.    Mr. Bienstock: The eggs were also sold through a cooperative. The egg marketing cooperative was called Farmco. That was interesting because Farmco was a little bit based probably on a union-type of contract. Farmco had a contract with a number of dealers that made them pay a certain market price for the eggs. There was a price sheet, and I wish it was in existence today. This was a paper published by Urner Barry, a private company that published the daily produce prices for eggs, chickens, and all kinds of different things. That was the basis for the price we got paid for the eggs.    Ms. Higgins: So you all sold at the same price?    Mr. Bienstock: We all sold at the same price, right. Whatever the price would be. The dealer agreed to take all the eggs we had. In other words, they didn't tell us how much they wanted us to produce. They just agreed to buy whatever we had.    Ms. Bienstock: We had to sort them by size.    Ms. Higgins: Was this an outgrowth of the programs initiated during the Depression?    Mr. Bienstock: I don't think so. It was sort of like there was a need. I'm not sure exactly how it came about. Maybe it was because of the Depression, but what really happened was that most of the egg farmers did come from New York. So the cooperative relationships of supplier, producer, and buyer were probably patterned after the unions in New York. So I think there is probably a relationship.    Ms. Higgins: Was your family able to pursue any activities in the garment industry?    Ms. Bienstock: Not at that time.    Mr. Bienstock: No, once he left New York, he left New York. My father had tried, in the beginning, to get into the garment trade. As a matter of fact, one of the problems he had proved to be a very sour experience. He worked for minimum wage, and he was a skilled person. In the garment industry, there was the cutter, the designer, etc. But he found that in order to get into the union, he had to "bribe," or you had to pay a certain amount of money in order to get into the union. And he just thought he wasn't going to do that, because he wasn't sure whether or not they would live up to their word. He just didn't feel certain about the whole thing. So he got soured by that, and decided it wasn't for him. My mother by the way, tried various things herself. She took some things in and did some embroidery work so they could make a living.    Ms. Higgins: There were a number of people I interviewed that worked making uniforms for the servicemen, a number of people who had been trained in the garment industry. That's why I asked.    Mr. Bienstock: That was probably a little bit later.    Ms. Higgins: Yes, during the War.    Mr. Bienstock: There was an aunt of mine that did some embroidery work like gold stitching, and things like that.    Ms. Higgins: It seems from what you said, you almost barely got settled when you went to War.    Mr. Bienstock: Yes.    Ms. Higgins: Did you take over the business, Bea?    Ms. Bienstock: I wasn't there. We were married in 1944, but I lived in New York, in Brooklyn then.    Mr. Bienstock: I was working in New York and going to school a little bit, and I did various things.    Ms. Bienstock: He went to the library, where I worked.    Ms. Higgins: I was going to ask how you met.    Mr. Bienstock: Yes, that's how we met. We met at the library.    Ms. Higgins: The New York Public Library?    Ms. Bienstock: The Brooklyn Public Library, the Brownsville branch.    Ms. Higgins: The Brooklyn Public Library is considered one of those librarian's libraries that has been instrumental in founding our own public library system. Were you a librarian?    Ms. Bienstock: No, I was a college graduate with a teaching degree. And there were no available jobs, because they didn't need any English teachers. It was war time  they needed science and mechanical teachers. I was going with some fellow at the time who told me there was an opening at the library. And that's how it came about.    Mr. Bienstock: Tell them how much you made a week.    Ms. Bienstock: I made two dollars and fifty cents a day!    Ms. Higgins: Oh, good heavens! Was that full-time work?    Ms. Bienstock: Full-time work. It was three evenings and six days a week. Two dollars and fifty cents a day, as a full-time librarian!    Mr. Bienstock:  This was not unusual, because everyone got the same thing. Minimum wage was thirty-five cents an hour, and you made fourteen dollars a week. And that was it. I did some factory-type work when we first came, and I moved from one job to another one. But the pay didn't really get up that much. Later on, I made a little bit more than when I first started. Actually my parents took care of the farm, and I came back weekends and worked part-time, and it helped them to get started. But I had a little bit of technical engineering background in Europe, and I got into a metal working place. That was before the War. Then my salary was sixty dollars a week.    Ms. Higgins: Well, let's just talk about your military service for awhile.      Picture of baby chicks  Mr. Bienstock: Can I make another remark? My parents took over the place in 1942. We had a clear income of sixty or seventy dollars a week, which was quite a bit of money at that time. If you are familiar with the chicken business, the chickens are good only for one year, maybe eighteen months, to lay the eggs, because our business was to sell the eggs only, and not the chickens.    Ms. Bienstock: We would get rid of the old ones, and then raise baby chickens.    Mr. Bienstock: The summertime was your peak profit period. Let's say from June to February, you had most of the income, because you only fed the chickens that produced the eggs. But after that, you took in new chickens to replenish the old ones. So therefore, you had to feed the young ones. So obviously, you had to eat up some of the profits the rest of the year.    Ms. Higgins: Maybe what you are saying is they made sixty or seventy dollars a week, instead of the sixteen or seventeen dollars a week you might make, but that was maybe because they worked so many hours.    Mr. Bienstock: That's true, it was seven days a week. At the time, nobody really minded it that much. It was just a different way of life.    Ms. Bienstock: People used to come out to visit, and then you would be sitting there with company, and you were not going to run out to the chicken coops. So they would think it was such an ideal life! (laughter) They would think we just sat here and the chickens just laid eggs, and we didn't have to do any work.      Pedigreed roosters from Babcock Breeding Farm waiting for baby chickens to mature  Mr. Bienstock: It was hard work, but if you were a good manager, you could take off a few hours or control your life to a certain extent. You weren't completely independent, but you didn't report to anyone in particular.    Ms. Higgins: What happened to the chicken business?    Mr. Bienstock: Actually what happened was in the 1950s. There was an oversupply. The egg prices dropped, but the feed prices did not. And there just wasn't any profit margin left.    Ms. Bienstock: Then the feed companies took over and built their own…they had their own people working in the chicken farms.    Mr. Bienstock: Also, the expenses were higher here. Taxes were higher and labor was higher.    Ms. Higgins: What do you mean by "here:" Monmouth County?    Mr. Bienstock: Yes, compared to Georgia and places like that. That was in the 1950s and 1960s. It was a competitive thing, really.    Ms. Higgins: The rug mill moved south, too.    Mr. Bienstock: They moved south for the opposite reason. Well, actually because it was cheaper labor there.    Ms. Higgins: The chickens worked for the same money, but in a sense, no! Do you think the decline had anything to do with the fact that during the War people were eating a lot more eggs because of the meat rationing, and then after the War, they weren't?    Ms. Bienstock: It might have a little.    Mr. Bienstock: They probably were eating more, but there is always a relationship between egg prices and meat prices. As meat prices go down, usually egg prices come down, too. But there was one factor that was very important. Somebody found out that eggs had a lot of cholesterol.    Ms. Bienstock: Of course meat did, too.    Mr. Bienstock: And you would be surprised how dramatically the consumption of eggs dropped! What also happened was that because people started to work again, instead of having leisurely breakfast at home, they would eat cereal and things like that. Eggs were the staple food mostly for breakfast, and habits had changed. Those were all factors that influenced the pricing of the eggs.    Ms. Higgins: You were farming with your parents at the time of this decline?      Mr. Bienstock and Ms. Eckstat after Mr. Bienstock joined the army. They were engaged.  Mr. Bienstock: Actually, I got into the Medical Corps in the service, and I'm not sure why. I was trained in the Medical Corps, for whatever reason. Then at some point, a few of us were pulled out. We were mostly German Jews, Jews who had been born in Germany and spoke German. We were pulled out, and we were sent to a training facility in Maryland. Henry Kissinger was at the same school, but he probably was about four or five classes before me. The training was about three months, or something like that. We basically were instructed in the Order of Battle of the Germany army.    Ms. Higgins: Instructed in what?    Mr. Bienstock: It is a military term. Order of Battle means the organizational charts of an Army, and it's called the Order of Battle.      At the end of the battle of Ruhr, a German corps-commander posing for a picture, somehow putting a smile on his face  Ms. Bienstock: Well, actually it was military intelligence.    Mr. Bienstock: Yes. So we were trained as interrogators of prisoners of war.    Ms. Bienstock: There is a wonderful picture of him with one of the Major Generals, sitting in a jeep. He was sitting and guarding him because the General was a prisoner.    Mr. Bienstock: Anyway, I went overseas fairly early, before D-Day. On D-Day, I was in England. Because they anticipated a certain amount of casualties, the Army always had replacements. I wasn't in the first wave, but I was like a second fiddler. So I was in the replacement wave. During the Normandy Invasion, I was in England. But about six weeks later, a lot of the people from the intelligence school were sent in. We were sort of like a group that had certain, particular skills, and they kept us together to be parceled out as the need arose. Then I wound up in the Seventh Armored Division. I joined them in Holland.    Ms. Higgins: Was that Patton?    Mr. Bienstock: No, that was the First Army. Patton came up from the south.    Mr. Aumack: So you were Monty's campaign.    Mr. Bienstock: Right. I joined a team. Our purpose was to interrogate the prisoners of war at the Battalion level. In other words, we were in the G2, and G2 is Intelligence. We were attached to the G2, but we were pretty much independent. Our mission was to collect tactical intelligence. The real purpose was to find out who was in front of us, in other words, which German unit we were fighting. And you could establish that when you first interrogated a prisoner, because they came to us. So we interrogated them, and the first thing we found out was what army they belonged to. According to Geneva laws, they only had to give us name, rank, and serial number. But it was usually not a problem. But let me continue on a little bit, because it changed later on.  And we really didn't have that many prisoners come in. I was over there in 1944, and by the fall of 1944, it was fairly quiet. We had some artillery fire coming in, but I was fairly far back. Well, we weren't really that far back, but we were about two or three miles from the actual front line. The infantry was right up front. It was probably about November of that year, we were sort of floating around. Then all of a sudden, the Germans decided to break through in Holland and Belgium. And we were brought in around November or December  it was before Christmas. We were brought into Belgium, and then we became part of the Battle of the Bulge. That was one of the toughest periods I have had. It was very cold, and there were no real facilities. The Belgians were so friendly, and it was a little bit different than the Germans. But we didn't want to take anything away from them because they were so friendly, so we stayed outside. And it was freezing…unbelievable! Besides that, I heard some German commands. We were in the company headquarters, and we heard the Germans broke through. As a matter of fact, we saw some American soldiers take off this way, and we went that way. And I mean there were some really young kids that were thrown in, and the Germans knew that there were some green troops, and that's when they broke through. There were also a lot of rumors about spies and things like that. I had a particular problem because our whole team was all ex-Germans, and we all had very heavy German accents, which made us a little bit nervous. I still have an accent today, but in those days, I had a much, much stronger and heavier German accent. Anyway, after that, I think what actually happened was the Germans ran out of supplies. It was very well planned, but they just ran out of supplies, which was our luck. As an aside, I had an occasion to get back to the city I was born and raised in. And that was in the Ruhr Valley, which is a heavy and intense industrial steel and coal area of Germany.      A picture of the ruins, October 1945  Ms. Bienstock: We have a lot of pictures of all these ruins.    Mr. Bienstock: Well, that was pretty much mopped up, and the rest of the campaign was a piece of cake. And the German people did not really fight us, or anything like that. They were glad, I think, that it was over. They were poor, and they had very little to eat. For a pack of cigarettes or a bar of soap, you could buy three quarters of Germany.      Arnheim, Germany in October, 1945  Ms. Bienstock: I think an interesting point to bring in here, is that you found your aunt and uncle.    Mr. Bienstock: Oh yes, that's one thing I forgot to mention. I knew that a sister of my mother had survived the War in Holland. And they were hidden, and they were underground. The children were farmed out to other people for the main reason that children make noise. And they were usually in a hay barn, or something like that. That is the way they survived, with the help of the Dutch people. They had some money and they paid, but still the Dutch people took a big chance to hide the German Jews. But they did. My uncle had family here, and somehow through the Red Cross, I found out where he was located. That was while we were in the service.    Ms. Bienstock: I think it was actually after the War.    Mr. Bienstock: Oh no, it was during the War. In the service, you couldn't do a lot of things. We had a jeep, and you could do pretty much what you wanted, within reason. Let's say you wanted to take a trip of thirty or forty miles. Normally you would have to tell someone you were going to go someplace. And it was a very, very emotional experience. Another interesting thing was that while I was Jewish, the other two members of the team were not Jewish. One of them actually left Austria because he was Catholic, and he just couldn't make it. And the older one, he had a very unusual experience. His parents were still in Germany, and he was Gentile. He was older than I was, and he was in England because he was a wholesale cotton dealer. He was a broker, really. And that's how he got to the States, it wasn't related to any political pressure at all. He just didn't like to be in Germany for one reason or another. His brother, though, was in the German army, and he eventually was killed on the Eastern front. Later on toward the end of the War, this fellow came with me when I went to find my uncle and aunt. Then later on, I went with him to find his parents, somewhere near Frankfurt. So that was an interesting experience. After the Armistice, we were shifted and assigned to prisoner of war camps. There we interrogated the prisoners of war. We had to classify them, because if they had a certain amount of rank, they were considered suspect, and they were separated.    Ms. Bienstock: Is that when you got your General?    Mr. Bienstock: I don't know, the General just drove in and surrendered.    Ms. Higgins: Were you married all this time?    Ms. Bienstock: Yes, we were married before he went overseas.    Ms. Higgins: And you were then at the library?    Ms. Bienstock: Then I was working in an office in Manhattan.    Mr. Bienstock: I suspect because it paid more money.    Ms. Bienstock: Yes, it would have been more than the library. I think I earned forty dollars a week, or something like that. I did payroll.    Ms. Higgins: And your in-laws were…    Ms. Bienstock: They were on the farm.    Ms. Higgins: Coping with the downgrading of the prices and trying to keep the farm together.    Ms. Bienstock: Yes.    Ms. Higgins: And they had five acres?    Mr. Bienstock: Yes, they had five acres originally.    Ms. Higgins: Did they farm anything else?    Mr. Bienstock: No. The soil in our area was pretty sandy and poor, and we didn't really have any skills. Later on, many years later, we started to grow vegetables and things like that. But they were not for sale, they were just for our home. And I still do today.    Ms. Bienstock: And now we have forty acres.    Ms. Higgins: You have forty acres?    	Three families operated the adjoining farms during the mid nineteen fifties. Mr. Josef Bienstock and Mrs. Martha Padawer are brother and sister.   Standing (from left): Josef Bienstock, Miriam Bienstock, Bea Bienstock (Mrs. Josef), Jill Padawer (between Bea and Martha), Martha Padawer, Elsa Bienstock, Gabriel Padawer.    Sitting (from left): Wolf Bienstock (family patriarch), Marshall Bienstock, Mrs. Ida Eckstat (mother of Bea Bienstock), Susan Padawer (front), Dora Bienstock (Mrs. Wolf, partially obscured)    Mr. Bienstock: Yes. When I came back from the Service, I didn't have any real skill. So I joined my parents on the farm. When we first came, we had old buildings, and the house didn't have indoor plumbing. There was an outhouse, and there were no showers or anything like that. There was a shower, but it was outside.    Ms. Higgins: Is this the house you live in now?    Ms. Bienstock: No.    Mr. Bienstock: But that is one of the first things we did: remodel the house and put in indoor plumbing.    Ms. Bienstock: The house we live in now was lived in by the Searles family. Mr. Searles was a manager of some sort at the Lairds on Colts Neck Road.    Ms. Higgins: Let me get this straight. Your father and mother have a five-acre farm, but you didn't live there.    Ms. Bienstock: No, we lived a couple of doors down.    Mr. Bienstock: We rented a house about a couple hundred yards away. Eventually, my sister and brother-in-law bought that farm. I think Searles got tired of chickens. We had rented a house next door, and we were always friendly with them. And they approached us and asked if we wanted to buy their house. And then we bought that house, and my brother-in-law bought the house I had rented. He eventually sold it, and he didn't stay in the business. He found that he liked engineering a bit better.    Ms. Bienstock: He has a Ph.D. from M.I.T.    Ms. Higgins: The chicken business was failing, so what did you do?    Mr. Bienstock: No, at that time the chicken business was still alive.    Ms. Higgins: In the late 1940s, ok.    Ms. Bienstock: We didn't sell the chickens until the early 1960s.    Mr. Bienstock: Actually there were periods where there were good times and not such good times. The bottom finally dropped out probably around 1960. And it was a very tough period. My parents had left, by the way, by that time. My parents had gone back to Germany for a short period of time, mainly for the purpose of restitution. We kept the house for them, and they went back and forth. But actually, they had moved away from the farm.    Ms. Higgins: Did you help with the farm?    Ms. Bienstock: Not really, I was teaching at the time.    Ms. Higgins: Where did you teach?    Ms. Bienstock: Originally I was an English teacher, and I was supposed to teach in the higher grades. But I became interested in reading, and I wanted to know where reading problems started. And I worked three years in second grade, and I wrote my thesis on second grade reading. But they said that they didn't need reading teachers. So I found a job at Old Bridge, in the high school. It was a new school, and it was the first year that it was open. And I was the Reading Specialist there, and I was there for twenty-four years, until I became sick and had to retire. At the time, it was called Madison Township High School, and they changed it to Old Bridge.    Mr. Bienstock: Actually, things got bad in the late 1950s. And I got to the point in my life where I felt if I didn't do something else, I would be stuck and not be able to change anymore. I liked the life, but I knew economically it was a difficult thing. You need a bunch more capital to mechanize the chicken business. You needed an enormous amount of capital to automate things, and the margin wasn't there to support it. The idea was to increase the number of chickens from 10,000 to 20,000 if you weren't making enough money, but obviously that took a lot of capital to put up the extra buildings and get the machinery, etc. Anyway, I decided I didn't want to go that route. So I started to look around. I felt I had had a very sheltered life because I was home all the time. I was involved in different things and with the community, so I wasn't completely self-contained. But at some point, and through a friend of mine, I went into sales. Actually this friend was an army buddy of mine. He had been in the country a little bit longer than I had been. And somehow we remained in contact with each other, even after we got out of the army. One day he told me I should just try it, and he gave me a bunch of leads that were at least six months old, and he gave me a book. He imported equipment that was sold to the pharmaceutical industry, mostly lab equipment and things like that.    Ms. Higgins: That was a good field to get into.    Mr. Bienstock: Yes, it was good. As I mentioned before, I had an engineering background and had gone to engineering school for awhile.    Ms. Higgins: Did you have some medical training?    Mr. Bienstock: No, no real medical training. I had only learned how to keep someone comfortable, and the Army training was only for about two months. It was more like a hands-on, nursing type situation. The people I visited for this business were small and large pharmaceutical companies. I also went to some of the hospitals. When I started this, I didn't even know how to make a contact. But the funny thing was, I felt I might be able to make a living out of it. When it comes to friends and finances, sometimes things don't work out too well. (laughter) I was doing fairly well, and I was strictly working on commission at that time. We were still friendly, but I started to feel that my friend wasn't completely honest. And I felt that I was being taken advantage of. He had a certain line, and I was visiting the same people. And I liked what I was doing. It was technical application of selling, really. Then I started looking around for a job, and I got into something that was completely unrelated to pharmaceutical work. I got a job then, and not just on commission as I was before. And there are some advantages and disadvantages to that. For two years, the farm kept going. First I was trying to get into the camera repair business, and I did a couple different things. But I had some help, and we didn't raise any new chickens. We sort of coasted on what we had, which was alright for a couple of years. We got into debt, though, and that was another problem. But by doing all these different things, it was manageable. We got a little close to losing our place a couple of times. We had a few periods where we did really well, but we really had to put all the money back into the farm. But we did buy more property, and that's how we got forty acres. Our son is farming, but he doesn't do the type of farming I did. He is into grain farming.    Ms. Bienstock: He is a graduate from the University of Delaware in Agricultural Engineering.    Mr. Bienstock: He decided to go into grain farming. He used the old chicken coop buildings. One of the reasons we are able to hold on to the property is because of our son. He grows some hay and corn on a few of the acres, so we have farm assessment.    Ms. Higgins: He probably as a child heard you talking about all those high prices of grain.    Mr. Bienstock: And you know, today it is the opposite. Today grain is very cheap. But there was a time where eggs were like thirty cents a dozen and a bushel of grain was twice as much as it is today. You know, it's a supply and demand thing.    Ms. Higgins: You must have been quite busy with three children. Tell us about it.    Ms. Bienstock: We put them all through college. The first two were girls, and they are both in education.    Mr. Bienstock: We had a little bit of help because my mother-in-law lived with us. The reason my wife could go to work was because my mother-in-law kept the kids.    Ms. Higgins: You were saying there were changes in the zip codes.     Mr. Bienstock: We paid our taxes to Howell, but Howell was split up into three different areas. It was Freehold, Lakewood, and Farmingdale. Our first address was R.D.#2 Freehold, and as it grew, we became R.D.#4, Freehold. Then our address became 207 Casino Drive, Freehold, and then 207 Casino Drive, Howell. And then the post office decided that it was such a screwed up area, they couldn't tell where anything was. So they divided all the property into 50-foot areas, and each one got a number. Then we became 655 Casino Drive. We have had five different addresses.    Mr. Bienstock: The biggest change was from Freehold to Howell. We were not particularly fond of it for awhile. People in Howell felt very strongly to have their own identity. But anyway, it worked out all right, but we had no choice. You didn't vote on it or anything like that, somebody just decided that's what they were going to do.    Ms. Bienstock: The funny thing is that Lemon Road is right up the road from us, but it is Farmingdale. And they never changed their numbers. So you go up Lemon Road, and you have 47, 52, 67, and then 24, etc.    Mr. Bienstock: They changed the name.    Ms. Bienstock: No they didn't. They are all different numbers.    Mr. Bienstock: They changed recently because of the Matawan situation.    Ms. Higgins: What would you say are the most significant changes you have seen in Howell?    Mr. Bienstock: Urbanization.    Ms. Bienstock: Development. We went to a concert at Rutgers a few weeks ago. We got off at Route 18, about twelve miles from our house. And I counted thirty-six commuter buses coming south!    Ms. Higgins: Wow!    Ms. Bienstock: That's a lot of development.    Ms. Higgins: That is a lot. Is anyone watching it, to your satisfaction?    Ms. Bienstock: Right now our mayor is putting a moratorium on development. He is trying to cut down on the development in the Township.    Mr. Bienstock: Today it's both political and clout. Sometimes the Township does not want certain things to be developed, but certain people have their own money and the rights of zoning…    Ms. Bienstock: I hope they don't change Howell Township to Hovnanian Township…    Ms. Higgins: Are you serious?    Mr. Bienstock: It has not been established, because all of these things are still in the courts. Even zoning can be fought against in court. If a developer has enough money and clout, he does pretty much what he wants, because he has the resources to do so.    Ms. Bienstock: Having been in the school system for thirty-two years, I know this. At one time, when small developers put up housing, they had to put something towards a school. Today they put up whatever housing they want without thinking about schools. Every child that comes into a school costs a minimum of $10,000 today. If a family comes in with two or three children, that's $20,000 to $30,000. And their taxes do not cover that schooling. Who is paying for it? I am.    Mr. Bienstock: Are you familiar with Howell at all?    Ms. Higgins: Not really.    Mr. Bienstock: There's a section in Howell which is Adelphia.    Ms. Higgins: Is Adelphia in Howell?    Mr. Bienstock: Yes, it's part of Howell. But they have their own post office.    Ms. Bienstock: And it's the best post office in New Jersey. If you want anything sent out fast, go to Adelphia.    Mr. Bienstock: Adelphia is sort of like a little village in itself. It has it's own history, by the way. A lot of it was related to the funeral parlor there, and I think the Claytons were the prominent people there.     Ms. Bienstock: And Josef was a fireman at one time.    Mr. Bienstock: I belonged to the fire company for twenty-five years. Actually until I started to work outside the farm. I know you have all heard about affordable housing. There was a development right across the street from the Adelphia post office, and you should go past there. It's the ugliest thing.    Ms. Bienstock: It was beautiful farmland.    Mr. Bienstock: It's called Adelphia Greens.    Ms. Higgins: Are the roads keeping up with developing?    Ms. Bienstock: No, there is so much traffic.    Mr. Bienstock: I don't know whether you commute at all, but once in awhile we have to get into New York fairly early. And we go by bus. And there is a Park and Ride in Howell. It's bad in the morning, but it's worse in the evening. A trip that would normally take you about an hour, you are doing good if you can make it in two hours. And it's getting worse.    Ms. Bienstock: I never voted against schools in my life, but when I see the developments coming up, there is no provision for the schools at all.    Mr. Bienstock: One of the nice things: if you have the house and you retire, and you have a little bit of a resource, it's an easy life. We have been in retirement for twelve years now, and we spend our winters in Florida. We managed to buy a condo in Florida, and we have a pretty nice arrangement where we spend five months in Florida and seven months here. And we really enjoy that. You don't have the stress or the wind of the cold weather, and we usually leave right after Thanksgiving, and we come back after Easter. And you do different things in Florida than you do here.    Ms. Higgins: You are my audience that disappears after Thanksgiving! (laughter) Would you care to comment on the facilities in Monmouth County, including if you like the library, the park system, or whatever?    Ms. Bienstock: We used to go to the library…well, first there was a bookmobile.    Ms. Higgins: Oh yes, when your children were little.    Ms. Bienstock: Right. That was my big social event.    Mr. Bienstock: Very rarely do we use the Howell library.    Ms. Bienstock: I can't even find it.    Mr. Bienstock: Unfortunately we don't use the library now as much as we used to. As you get older and slow down a little bit, I find that I have much less time than I used to.    Ms. Higgins: So many people say that. I think there is somebody up there shaving a millisecond off every day! (laughter)    Mr. Bienstock: I am very jealous of the way I spend my time. I still have a little garden but we cut back every year, and we have some fruit trees. And I do some woodworking.    Ms. Higgins: You are still actively farming your acreage?    Mr. Bienstock: I am a gofor for my son now  I don't participate in it very much. But I help him whenever I can, if he needs help.    Ms. Bienstock: And we have some fruit trees. We have automatic lighting outside the house, where if you drive up, the light automatically goes on. Well at five o'clock this morning, I saw the light was on, because the deer come at that time. You can see deer tracks all across the lawn.    Mr. Bienstock: I am very proud that last week I was able to drive the hay bailer for my son. It's a very intense labor period now because you depend on the weather to try and get your stuff in. And sometimes he can't get enough help. So whenever I can, I pitch in.    Ms. Higgins: Beatrice, please comment on education during the twentieth century in Monmouth County. Tell us how it was when you found it, when you were working there, and how you see it now.    Ms. Bienstock: I think the education was good. My three children went through high school, and I think they did well. We had one school on Adelphia Road. Now we have nine or ten elementary schools, and five or six schools in the regional high school system!    Mr. Bienstock: Our children did not settle in Howell. Well our son is in Howell, but he doesn't have any children. The two daughters have children, but one lives in the state of New York and the other lives in south Jersey. I have a feeling that the school system changed, especially as to the activities like Girl Scouts and Boy Scouts. I think the schools were much more a part of the life of the family when our kids grew up. And I don't think the PTAs are nearly as strong.  I think it's because of all the people coming in from various places outside. It's not as homogeneous as it was when our children grew up. And we were sort of grafted onto it, too, because then we were the outsiders. It took us awhile to get Americanized, and just to speak the language. But we adapted very well. Adelphia Fire Company was very insulated, and it was very difficult to become volunteer. Around the late 1940s or early 1950s, my brother-in-law and myself were invited to become members of Adelphia Fire Company. Although we were active members, socially you really did not mix much with all the other people who were born in the area. I never went to school here, and there is a grade school and high school. So it makes a big difference. All the people in Adelphia Fire Company had a common background because they went to school together, to church together, etc. But we were taken in very, very nicely, and that lasted for a long period of time. Most of the people are gone now, and I haven't been an active member for almost forty years. When we came here, Howell had about 2500 inhabitants. It was very, very small, and you certainly knew the people on your street.    Ms. Bienstock: There was only one school at the time. And now there are about ten or twelve schools, I think.    Mr. Bienstock: Today I think it's more like 50,000 people here, and it's more like a city. A lot of things have changed. We had no zoning. When you wanted to build something, you built it. It was really a free life. There were no codes, no plumbing codes, no building codes, etc.    Ms. Higgins: Were you in the county when the troubles at Fort Monmouth were going on? Would you care to comment on that?    Mr. Bienstock: Oh, yes. We belonged to the Jewish Community Center, which was really in Farmingdale. And that was pretty much the center of our social life. Farmco, the egg cooperative, had their meetings at the Jewish Community Center.    Mr. Aumack: Do you remember a very wonderful woman who used to come to the library all the time, Ruth Keats?    Ms. Bienstock: We were very close, dear friends.    Mr. Aumack: Anyway, her husband was working at Monmouth at the time. His name was not Keats, it was Katz, and he changed it because of the problems in Monmouth at the time.    Ms. Higgins: I knew Ira Katchen, who was the lawyer who was so instrumental in helping many of the people accused.    Mr. Bienstock: In Germany, it was guilt by association. If you were Jewish, you were automatically suspected to be a leftist. By the way, the Community Center suffered with that also. There was a feed cooperative which was much more leaning towards the left side.    Ms. Higgins: Did Agway come out of these farming cooperatives?    Mr. Bienstock: No, Agway was much older. Farmco and FLF were fairly recent because the chicken business did not really become established until the late 1930s, when it became more concentrated. Before people had chickens, but they weren't organized. Agway was the successor to GLF, (Grange League Federation) and GLF was an old, established farm association which really was not that political, but conservative.    Ms. Higgins: So GLF is older?    Mr. Bienstock: Yes.    Ms. Higgins: There are Grange buildings all over the County.    Mr. Bienstock: I think GLF was much stronger in New York state.    Ms. Higgins: Was GLF regarded as leftist?    Mr. Bienstock: No, it was FLF that was really leftist. And the Jewish community suffered. At one time, it was really split apart. After McCarthy, people began to feel afraid to show their convictions on the outside, and they kept them to themselves. They were afraid to lose their jobs, and that was a tough period. Then the leftists sort of faded away. Some of them were probably Communist, and they sort of took their cue from Russia. You probably heard of the Doctor Trials in Russia, and that changed a lot of the outlook of people here, too. They saw that Communism was antisemetic, and people became disillusioned. Today, you have new conservatives like Harry Krystal. Do you know Harry Krystal? His son was advisor to the vice president under Bush.    Ms. Higgins: Let's back up just a minute to the library on Broad Street that you were talking about.    Ms. Bienstock: We used to go there for the book reviews and discussion groups.    Mr. Bienstock: For awhile the library was in Grand Union, and I think from there, they moved here.    Mr. Aumack: When did this library open?    Ms. Bienstock: 1986. I belonged to the Friends of the Library for years, and then we started going to Florida. But they used to call me to come in and help out.    Ms. Higgins: When we changed the tape, you were talking about Mr. Krystal.    Mr. Bienstock: He was one of the political figures that went all the way from the left. I just happened to remember his name because it's a typical political flip flop…I mean he changed so much from being a leftist to being an ultra conservative. And there are others like that, too. At the moment, I can't think of their names. Interestingly enough, the people who suffered, somehow I don't think they ever became new conservatives. They pretty much stayed level. The people that did not really suffer, they just were exposed or they were active but did not really physically or personally suffer by McCarthy.    Ms. Bienstock: I just remembered, you should have a couple of books here at the library that were written by Dr. Gertrude Dubrovsky. It is the history of Howell and the Jewish Community Center.    Ms. Higgins: She came and gave a talk here once. She is a very interesting woman.    Ms. Bienstock: Yes, I know her very well. Our kids went to school together.    Mr. Bienstock: Their parents had a farm.    Ms. Higgins: It was in Farmingdale, right?    Ms. Bienstock: Yes. Now she is in Princeton.    Ms. Higgins: Did you find when you came to the county that there were any problems regarding relations between the races, and would you care to comment on that?    Ms. Bienstock: It was segregated. When we went to the movies, the Black people sat upstairs. Mrs. Roosevelt wrote an article in "My Day" about Freehold and the Blacks being allowed to go into the movies without having to sit upstairs.    Mr. Bienstock: We didn't have any Blacks in Germany.    Ms. Higgins: The schools were not segregated?    Ms. Bienstock: No, not when I was there.    Mr. Bienstock: I think when we first came, we were not really aware of it with our children. We didn't have children at the time  our children were born after the War and didn't go to school until the 1950s or so. I think the one school in Freehold was segregated. As a matter of fact, it was the one on Court Street. And they didn't know what to do with it anymore, so they just made offices out of it.    Ms. Bienstock: But when I taught there, it was not segregated. I had Black children then.    Mr. Bienstock: But we were not really ever exposed to segregation. I don't think that Howell was segregated. But we didn't really have knowledge of it because our kids did not enter the system until the 1950s. By that time, there was a new New Jersey Constitution, which was probably written in the late 1940s, I think. But it was after the War. Are you aware of it? You ought to look at that. I think that did away with the segregation. And so I am not an expert on those things, but I am fairly certain that it had a lot to do with doing away with segregation.    Ms. Higgins: Do you have any questions, Doug?    Mr. Aumack: I'd like to discuss your background of being a German Jew. You said you came to New York in 1941. Was the reason you came in 1941 to New York City because you were a Jew? Was that the main reason?    Mr. Bienstock: Definitely yes.    Ms. Bienstock: He left Germany in 1938.    Mr. Bienstock: We moved through Europe, and I don't want to get too involved talking about that because it's a separate chapter. My granddaughter wrote a little story about my travels.    Ms. Bienstock: They were climbing over the Pyrennes, he and his father.    Mr. Bienstock: Just to sort of give you a little bit of a closer background, what happened was I was born and raised in Germany. And I went to German schools. In 1933, there had been some upheaval in Germany partly because of the economics, and there was a Depression. Germany was always much more Nationalistic than other countries in Europe probably. Hitler had become very powerful, and the German people really had voted almost fifty percent for the Nationalistic Party, the NSDAP or Nazi Party. But in 1933, there were a lot of disturbances. On the left side there was a leftist element, and there was the right side. Actually the one which governed was the Catholic Party, very similar to Christian Socialism. There was a very large Catholic group in Germany, and they had their own Party. But they were not able to govern because the parliament had a large proportion of Nazis in it. Interestingly enough in 1933, it went down a little bit. The numbers of Nazis within the parliament went down a little bit.    Ms. Bienstock: Isn't that about the time Hitler was elected?    Mr. Bienstock: No, Hitler was appointed. It was a parliamentary government. It was a little bit different, and not like he was elected. The parliament really was the deciding factor. There was a President, and his name was Hindenberg. He appointed Hitler, without any choice, because nobody else could form a government that would be able to govern the country and pass all the laws, because the parliament was so mixed up. Once Hitler came to power, it was well known that he was a rabble rouser.    Ms. Bienstock: He had already written Mein Kampf.    Mr. Bienstock: He thought all the economic problems were there because of the Jews. He postulated that they were the prime cause of poor economic times. Until that time, Germany was a perfect country. You minded your own business and you were more free. But once Hitler came to power, it changed very rapidly. Persecution included not only Jews, but all people that were opposed to him, including Catholics, Communists, and Social Democrats.    Ms. Bienstock: And Gypsies.    Mr. Bienstock: And they established concentration camps, and these people were put into them. And then for awhile, things quieted down a little bit. As a matter of fact what happened was because he geared up the military, the economy came up. As a matter of fact, my parents benefited by it, in a way. They were in the manufacturing business, and they had customers, and business became very good. And if you sell more, you make more money. It was simple as all that.    Ms. Bienstock: It's called Economics 101.    Mr. Bienstock: There were intermittent persecutions of Jews. I remember when I was a kid, they put up a big sign on our business that said, "This is a Jewish Enterprise," and things like that. In other words, there was a certain pressure. Some of the Nazis had certain people they didn't like, and they all of a sudden had the power to do something about it. They would beat them up, and there were some people that died, there is no question about it. This started out in 1933, and things changed fairly rapidly for awhile, and then they calmed down a little. Things didn't really change much until probably 1936 or 1937, when the Nuremberg Laws were enacted. Are you familiar with those things? It became law that the Jewish people couldn't have businesses and things like that. It was very common for everyone to have a maid. The Nuremberg Laws said our maid had to be at least forty-five years old. The reason for it was that she was not fertile. They were stupid, ridiculous things that were adopted, but that is what happened. The reason for that was that after forty-five years old, women usually could not conceive. Therefore, if any hanky panky would go on, there wouldn't be any mixed children. But anyway, there was no question that if you were a Jew in Germany, you were persecuted. They didn't kill you, but they didn't want you. I got kicked out of school in 1935, when I was fifteen years old. First they separated me…segregated…and I wasn't black, either. I hung in there for a few weeks, and I guess they thought I would get tired of it. But then they found some reason for expulsion, and that was it.    Ms. Higgins: I was just wondering how you came to America, also.    Ms. Bienstock: I was born here.    Ms. Higgins: Were your parents born here?    Ms. Bienstock: No, they came here on their honeymoon in 1906. They came from Russia. Actually, my father was what you would have called a revolutionary. You have heard of pogroms? My mother's father was a rabbi, the chief rabbi in their town. In the pogrom in 1905, he died. He wasn't killed, but in trying to rescue his family, he got wounded. He was forty-eight years old when he died. The following year, my mother met my father. And he had to get out, because otherwise he would have been sent to Siberia. While my mother was legally able to leave, my father wasn't, because he couldn't get a visa or passport. So they did the route where you are hidden in the back of a truck or farm wagon, and you pay through the nose to get there. And they eventually arrived in New York. My father was a skilled carpenter, so he had no trouble getting a job. Eventually my mother got tired of having babies, so she opened a store. She had been a school teacher. She worked for the Singer Company, and she had a school of sewing and design. In fact, during one of the pogroms, the chief of police who was running the pogrom, told his men not to touch that school because his daughter was going there and it was a good school for sewing. So her school was protected.    Ms. Higgins: I wondered if either one of you would comment on several things. When you were young and just married, what did you do for entertainment?     Ms. Bienstock: We usually went to movies or to the Community Center.    Mr. Bienstock: That was probably the extent of it.    Ms. Bienstock: We didn't have the money to do more. I mean you couldn't bring in a dozen eggs!    Mr. Bienstock: I do remember a very crass example of that. When we first dated, the hot dogs were a nickel, and I was a little hesitant to treat my wife. (laughter) We observed the Jewish laws at home. Kosher food, especially meats, were not readily available for many different reasons. As a matter of fact, there was a period when all we had was chicken, which wasn't necessarily a bad thing. When we came here, one of the first things that attracted me was that I always liked sausage, salami, and things like that. And I was really fond of hot dogs, which is an American thing. We had hot dogs in Germany too, but not kosher ones. When we came here, I used to like to eat them with sauerkraut, mustard and all that stuff. And you could get all that for a nickel! And when they went up to six cents, believe it or not, I stopped eating them. That's the kind of economics we had. You have to sort of understand because a nickel was a lot of money then. I made fourteen dollars a week, and you got by on it, but you couldn't do a heck of a lot. When we were married, we didn't have a car. I always liked skiing, and we didn't really have a honeymoon because I was in the service. We got married on a three-day pass. Bea and her mother made all the arrangements based on me being able to get out on a three-day pass. And that was it. When I came back from the Service, we went up to Canada, in the Montreal area, and went skiing. One of the first things we bought was a 1935 Dodge for $550. When the car was new, we probably could have bought it for less money, but that was after the War, and there were no cars. Everyone has their own taste, but our emphasis was more on reading or something else like that.    Ms. Bienstock: We read, and I was a very strong reader. We had records and radio.    Ms. Higgins: Do you have any words of advice or comment that you would like to leave for posterity?    Ms. Bienstock: You know there is an interesting article in today's Times on the very rich people, and what is happening to their children with drugs and laziness. It lists a number of young people who have died of heroin overdoses. And the article is trying to tell the parents what kind of restrictions to put on children so that they don't feel that because of all the money in the family, they can do whatever they want.    Mr. Bienstock: I don't think it is so much instructions. I always firmly believe that if you want your children to be a certain way, be that way yourself. In other words, lead the life. Don't tell the kids to be something, but be it yourself first. And then you really should not have to worry. And that's what we did, in retrospect. We acted the way we wanted our children to act, rather than telling them what to do. And that's the kind of advice I would like to leave them. Live the life you want your kids to live.    Ms. Bienstock: My older daughter is a math teacher in a New York high school. There is a school on 116th Street and FDR Drive called the High School of Math and Science. She is a high school teacher there. My second daughter is the Vice Principal in Marlton schools in South Jersey. In fact, they just had a wonderful program that I wasn't able to get to. She is very creative, and they had a beautiful program with artists, writers, actors, and musicians. In fact, people volunteered from Princeton, from the theater, from Rutgers, and other places. And they all came down to put on this fabulous program for the kids. It was like half-hour sections, and the children could rotate to each of these things. She has some of it on tape, and I am waiting to see it.    Ms. Higgins: She must have been planning that a long time.    Ms. Bienstock: Yes.    Ms. Higgins: How did you decide that you wanted to be an English teacher?    Ms. Bienstock: I don't know. I just gravitated to that. My favorites authors were Shakespeare and Milton, and I did a lot of reading and work on courses like that. Even in high school, we had courses like that. I liked Shakespeare and Milton rather than reading just general stuff.    Mr. Bienstock: Not to blow Bea's horn, but our children and grandchildren use Bea as their resource.    Ms. Bienstock: When my grandchildren need some information on literature and discussion, they call me up. Even my son-in-law calls me up for quotations from Shakespeare, etc.    Ms. Higgins: We're doing two Shakespeare plays this summer. We're doing Timon of Athens at Barnes & Noble for the New Jersey Shakespeare Festival, and we're doing the Taming of the Shrew here.    Ms. Bienstock: I was going to be a Shakespearean scholar at one time.    Ms. Higgins: Doug, did you have any more questions you would like to ask?    Mr. Aumack: Did you work as a spy?     Mr. Bienstock: No, I was a prisoner of war interrogator. When prisoners were brought in, we would interrogate them and try to find out which part of the German army was in front of us, which was very, very important. This was important especially in the Battle of the Bulge. They had brought in troops and equipment from the Russian front. And the American army did not know about that because it was done at night, and done very fast. And this was the sort of information we were after. We were trying to find out what the Germans were doing each day, and if there were new troops coming in, and things like that. In those times, I spoke more like a native German. At first they were amazed, and they immediately knew that I probably was Jewish. They sort of sensed it. And most of the time, you could not shut them up. One of the things they would tell you was how many Jewish friends they had. Accents are local here in the States, you know if somebody is from Rochester or Alabama, etc. In Germany, it is pretty much the same, but it's much smaller. I was born and raised in the Ruhr Valley, which is sort of near the Rhine. The twang I had is still with me today. My English probably still has that twang. It's something you grow up with, and it's something you never really lose. And so they knew where I was from. So it was just very simple. In the Battle of the Bulge, they were mostly the stormtroopers, the elite. They were part of the army also. And they were tough. They knew that all they had to divulge was their name, rank, and serial number. And we did not use any physical force, we just used psychology. I wouldn't even say we threatened, but we found out what we wanted.    Ms. Bienstock: Psychological force.    Mr. Bienstock: That was one of the things we were trained in, and some of it is common sense.    Ms. Bienstock: You know at Camp Ritchie, where he took his training, all orders were given in German. They would get a map of the locations around Ritchie, and the towns were all written in German. And they had to find their way around, that was part of their training. It's like dumping somebody in the middle of nowhere, and you had to try and find your way out. But the maps they were given were not the names of the area, but were in German, which I found very interesting.    Mr. Aumack: You mentioned Mrs. Roosevelt in "My Day" in which she used Freehold as an example. Could you talk more about that?    Ms. Bienstock: She wrote it because the movie theater was integrated at the time she wrote the article. She praised Freehold for liberating the Black people.    Mr. Bienstock: I think the New Jersey Constitution was adopted in the late 1940s. There were some legal problems in not integrating after the Constitution.    Ms. Higgins: I have a lost thread here. You said that after you had sold the pharmaceuticals on a commission basis, you got a "real job." But you didn't tell us what that was.    Mr. Bienstock: I'll just talk a little bit about it. It was a company that manufactured self-adhesive materials. Self-adhesives today are very widespread, but in those days, they were a novelty. This company established a machinery division, and the purpose of it was to increase the consumption of the self-adhesive material.    Ms. Higgins: What is the name of the company?    Mr. Bienstock: The name of the company was Kleen-Stik.     Ms. Bienstock: He had the whole east coast.    Mr. Bienstock: Anyway, the company I worked for was Label-Aire. Actually Label-Aire was a division of Kleen-Stik.    Ms. Higgins: And where were these companies located?    Mr. Bienstock: When I joined the company, it was in Chicago. I was hired as the eastern sales representative for the machinery division. Then the company moved to New Jersey, first to Newark and then to Princeton Junction. Then the self-adhesive part went belly-up and was partly sold, but the machinery division always made money, and it was bought out. Actually it existed until about two years ago, and then it was bought out by somebody else. I worked for them for twenty-five years. It was applications engineering. There was a machine, but it had to be adapted to manufacturing facilities. They had a patent on the big part of the machine that applied the label automatically at a fairly high speed on a production line. First we sold mostly to companies like Colgate that made some cosmetics and also soap powders and things like that. Originally the label would be a promotional item. Self-adhesives became more popular. Today most labels are self-adhesive, including stamps. I started there in 1963, and I worked there until 1987 or something like that.    Ms. Higgins: Did you work out of your home?    Mr. Bienstock: At first I worked out of the office in Newark. I really didn't know that much about the business, and I had somebody that trained me. I had a good grasp of the engineering background, but I didn't really know too much about the self-adhesive business. At that time we sold directly to the end user, like Lever Brothers, etc. The labels were produced by printers, which is sort of like an intricate thing. The printers sold labels to the end user. We sold the machinery to promote the uses of material, and in a way we controlled the label application. Since we made the machine, there were companies other than Kleen-Stik producing material, the printer was sort of inclined to buy Kleen Stik material. I was more interested in the machinery, because I really didn't get a commission on the self-adhesive label material, so I really had no proprietary interest in that. The self-adhesive business was a very competitive business, and so was the machinery end of it. But Kleen-Stik had a patent on the machine, and nobody else could make it, and the patent was good for seventeen years. There were other competitors around, but they had other methods of applying labels to the product. But ours was very, very flexible and very easy to use on a production line. The way the label was applied to the product was it was blown on, and that is why it was called Label-Aire.    Ms. Higgins: The twenty-first century is shaping up in Monmouth County. What are your comments on that?    Mr. Bienstock: When I started out years ago, I was very active in our Jewish community. And this was probably until the mid 1950s or late 1960s. When did we move, was it the mid 1960s? it used to be all chicken farmers, and I'll make the connection in one minute. And it was a very liberal group, and you never worried about insurance or liability. That was a term which was almost non-existent then. There were lawyers and this and that, and they would try and get some money out of a car accident, but it was certainly not for the phenomenal amounts like today. By the mid 1960s, our community changed. The farmers either died or moved out, or went bankrupt. And we were very proud that we were able to hold onto our land, because we had some very tough times in doing that. To me it was very important to maintain an honest name and not to file for bankruptcy, and somehow we survived, and it was by sheer willpower. Today that pride is not there anymore. A younger element came into the Jewish community, and they took over pretty much. They started to run the place. The first thing they worried about was liability insurance. And to us, you just took care of it if something happened, but obviously you didn't want anything to happen. And this was the beginning of a downhill course. And the same thing happened to politics. There was a famous story about the elections during President Johnson's campaign. They were fighting each other tooth-and-nail, and then later on they would have a poker game together. And they'd even enjoy a couple of drinks, and that was a common thing back then. You could fight each other politically, but still maintain a basic friendship. Now can you see that happen today?    Ms. Bienstock: This is society in general, not just in Monmouth County.    Mr. Bienstock: I found this meanness in politics. They try to destroy the other person. To me, I just want to forget about politics. It has become a very unpleasant, disagreeable kind of thing. And I don't want to have anything to do with it anymore. And this is what I am missing. I think our whole society has changed. Another thing is that the middle class was pretty strong. When I used to work, going back again to the 1960s, it was common that when you worked for somebody, once in awhile, you would even have something social to do together. There was a class difference, but it was acceptable from the worker's point of view. Today the difference between rich people and poor people is so much more, and there is no more connection between the two classes. And the middle class is sort of…well it hasn't disappeared, but life is not as gentle as it used to be years ago. I see this to be accelerating in the twentieth century. And if I am apprehensive about it, that is what I am apprehensive about. At some point, there has got to be a backlash.    Ms. Higgins: Do you have any concluding comments, Bea?    Ms. Bienstock: I think he took care of it!    Ms. Higgins: I have enjoyed this interview very much, and I thank you both for coming.    Mr. Bienstock: I want to thank you for listening to us. Anytime you have any questions, feel free to call us.    Ms. Bienstock: I was more or less protected being in school. I didn't have the kind of problems people have in the outside world, sort of. Over the years, I had some very prominent students. In fact the President of the Atlanta Braves was one of my students, Stanley Kasten. He was the president of the team, and he was my third grade student. Jerry Nadler, who is in Congress, was one of my students. And I could probably name a dozen more that I taught, and I feel very proud of having had good students.    Mr. Aumack: Have they turned out the way you wanted them to?    Ms. Bienstock: Many of them have. Many of them didn't, though. Can I tell you a funny incident about one student I had in the high school?    Ms. Higgins: Sure.    Ms. Bienstock: I had been out sick for one and a half years. I had cancer, and I had surgery. When I went back, they gave me an entirely different program from what I had been doing. And the name of the absolute worst student who was ever in that school was on my list. And I thought I wasn't going to survive that. So the first thing I did when he came into the classroom was to say, "These are the rules of my class. If you come in on time, you don't cut my class, and you don't give me hassles, you pass." And he questioned again if that was all you needed to do to pass. And I told him that was right. Then I told him if he did some work, he'd get a better grade, but he had to do those three things to pass. So he sat in the back of the room and kept looking at me like he couldn't figure it out… Well then finally he did drop out of school because the only class he passed was mine. (laughter) He got a 'D', and he got an 'F' on everything else. That was one of my greatest achievements!    Ms. Higgins: Well thanks again.    Mr. Aumack: Thank you very, very much.    Ms. Bienstock: Thank you very much.      Flora T. Higgins, Project Coordinator    Monmouth County Library System © 2001  
MonmouthCounty;John O'Brien;1932;1999;John O'Brien, 1932, 1999,         Remembering the 20th Century: An Oral History of Monmouth County    Date of Interview: September 28, 1999  Name of Interviewer: Flora Higgins  Premises of Interview: Eastern Branch, Monmouth County Library, Shrewsbury, NJ    Birth Date of Subject: December 31, 1932    Ms. Higgins: Mr. O'Brien, thank you for coming here to be interviewed and telling us what it was like growing up in Middletown Township.    Mr. O'Brien: Middletown Township was very rural in the 1930s and 1940s.  I was brought up on a farm in the Chapel Hill section of Middletown in Leonardo. We lived on the corner acre of my grandmother's farm. The roads were unpaved and transportation was nil, basically. We went to school and church in Atlantic Highlands, which is approximately three miles away, and we walked in both directions. In those days, being a Catholic, if you went to church on Sunday to receive communion, you had to fast from midnight the night before, so when you got home from church you were rather thirsty. There was nothing better than a cold glass of our well water.    Ms. Higgins: Transportation being a problem, did you get to enjoy much Monmouth County seashore?    Mr. O'Brien: Well, we were only about a half-mile or so from the bay, and we did a lot on the bay. We swam in the summer time, we'd seine for bait fish. My uncle had an oak rowboat that he built from driftwood, and when I was in high school, I used to use the boat to take my girlfriend out in the water. I'd swear the oars would bend as you used the oars in the water because the oak was so heavy. But one of my most significant memories is probably pre-teen.  The weather in those days seemed to be much colder in the winter time, and we used to go down for what we called frost fishing.  At that time when the first frost came in, the fish would come in close to shore, and the small waves would lap them onto the beach.  They were semi-stunned from the cold water, and we'd just walk along with a burlap sack and pick them up and bring them home. I can remember doing that on many occasions, but I can not remember what we did with them when we got them home.    Ms. Higgins: Did they go right into the freezer, being partially frozen anyway, or the frying pan?    Mr. O'Brien: Well, at that time we didn't have a freezer, we had what was called an icebox. And so you had very little space to do any freezing.  You were lucky to keep things cool for a while.    Ms. Higgins: You're not the first person I have interviewed to mention that the winters are not as cold as they used to be. Do you remember the river freezing over?    Mr. O'Brien: Yes, I remember the bay freezing over. There is an oral memory that's passed down.  My father had had a Model T Ford, and the bay froze over from Leonardo to the tip of Sandy Hook, and the story goes that he drove the Model T Ford across the bay -- across the ice to the tip of Sandy Hook. He also used to tell stories of other fellows who came out of Murphy's Tavern who tried the same thing, but the ice wasn't quite strong enough, and they lost their vehicles.  The Murphy's Tavern that I'm referring to at that time was actually called Boozies Depot Inn. It was adjacent to the railroad station in Leonardo.  And I believe it was owned by a family by the name of Murphy.  Model T.jpg (51587 bytes)    The Model T  owned by John O'Brien's father    Ms. Higgins: So how did your people happen to come to Monmouth County and end up in Leonardo and Chapel Hill?    Mr. O'Brien: That's a mystery that remains to this day. I've been doing a lot of genealogy work, and I have not been able to identify exactly how or where or when they arrived in this country. But my father's side of the family, the O'Briens, first showed up in the 1850 Federal Census both as single people in Middletown. I have not been able to find their passenger list records or their port of entry to date, although I'm still working on that issue.    Ms. Higgins: Of course you know of The Church of Latter Day Saints.    Mr. O'Brien: Yes, I have been there a number of times. I have found some information, but with no verbal information on whether they had any brothers or sisters, or parents' names, or even the exact date of entry, it's difficult, and there are a lot of dead end streets, and you have to try all of them to find the one that has the outlet you're looking for.    Ms. Higgins: O'Brien is such a common name, too.    Mr. O'Brien: Yes. Just like Smith.    Ms. Higgins: Back to this Model T across the river. Would horses go across the bay too?  Did you travel about on the frozen bay?    Mr. O'Brien: I would imagine so, but the only stories I remember about the river are people going ice fishing and ice boating. But when you ice boated the river was frozen from shore to shore so I could well imagine that horses went on it.    Ms. Higgins: Did you cut ice from the bay for the iceboxes?    Mr. O'Brien: Well, I believe the generation prior to myself did, but in Chapel Hill on the opposite side of the hill, the Route 35 side, there was an Old Mill pond and they used to cut ice there. This was on Whippoorwill Valley Road as it comes off of Chapel Hill Road.    Ms. Higgins: It's a good thing we're not dependent on that ice now. Did you ever go down and swim in the Highlands River?    Mr. O'Brien: No, we always had the bay, and Highlands was a little too far for us without having any vehicle. I was the first of three children and my father died when I was age seven.  My mother did not drive, and we had no transportation other than what my uncle from the farm provided us. And the only place he basically took us was to church on a Sunday when weather was bad.  Other than that we basically walked.    Ms. Higgins: And row boated.    Mr. O'Brien: Yes, row boated.    Ms. Higgins: When you were growing up did you take a trip to Newark or New York City?    Mr. O'Brien: I was lucky in that my mother had five sisters, one of whom lived in the family home in Leonardo, and she worked in Manhattan for many, many years, so most of the places we visited were through her benevolence. She took us to the Empire State Building, Statue of Liberty, Rockefeller Center, and I think at one point we had even gone to one of the plays at Radio City Music Hall.    Ms. Higgins: Well, that was quite a cultural background for that time.    Mr. O'Brien: I think in most cases we enjoyed the train rides, because the trains used to come right along the shore on the old Jersey Central line. But most of the time she'd take us down to Spring Lake on the train once or twice during the summer to go swimming, and the thing I remember there was that when you walked into the water you could walk in up to your waist and look down and still see your toes. Today if you walk in the water and look down you probably can't see more than an inch or two deep.    Ms. Higgins: Actually, during the past three or four years you have been able to see your toes on certain days.    Mr. O'Brien: We've come back around.    Ms. Higgins: One thing I think has been very good about the twentieth century is that we have reversed the trend of abusing our water sources.  Cindy Zipf was largely responsible for that locally.  Was your mother Irish as well?    Mary Agnes Ahern  John O'Brien's paternal grandmother,  circa 1888    Mr. O'Brien: No, my mother was German.  Her whole family side was German, so I've got fifty percent German on her side and fifty percent Irish on my father's side. My mother's father died within a month or so of my birth, so I really have no recollection of him. Her mother died early in my life also, so I have very, very little memory of her other than what I have in photographs. Same thing on my Irish side.  I don't remember my grandfather at all because he died when I was very young, but my grandmother had a lot to do with raising me. My father died, and my mother had to go to work.    Charles O'Brien  John O'Brien's father  circa 1930    Ms. Higgins: You were the eldest of three boys you said?     Mr. O'Brien: No, of three children. I had a sister who was directly behind me, and then a brother younger than that.    Ms. Higgins: Where did your mother work?    Mr. O'Brien: Well, when she first went to work, she worked in Eisner's Clothing Factory in Red Bank, and she had to get up early in the morning to take the bus to go to work, which meant that I had to take care of my brother and sister and make sure we got to school and back on time. And during the summer months that meant riding my brother on the handle bars of my bicycle, so I don't remember much of seeing the route going down there, only of the shoulder on the side of the road. That and the dogs that used to chase us.    Ms. Higgins: Eisner's was an old store even then, wasn't it?    Mr. O'Brien: Well, it was an old factory building, yes. But the Eisner family had quite a lot of employees. Most of their work was done for government contracts making military uniforms. As a matter of fact, I have one story from there.  When the quality control line found irregularities in something that was made, it was put aside for correction, if possible.  If the contract was ended before that was completed, then those items were available for purchase by the employees.  My mother had purchased for me, after I got out of high school, a navy foul weather jacket. The day I enlisted in the Navy, I wore that.  When we were inducted, we had to strip naked in a room and leave all of our clothes in pile.  We were told the Red Cross would send them to our homes. None of it ever got to our homes. When I got aboard ship I was issued a foul weather jacket that was nowhere near the quality of what I had.  In fact, it had no buttons on it, the zipper didn't work, and I had to use a rope to tie it around my waist, and yet this brand new one I went in there with was somehow sent elsewhere.  John USNavy 1952.jpg (40961 bytes)    John O'Brien, 1952 (with Sandy Hook in the background)    Ms. Higgins: When did you join?    Mr. O'Brien: Well, I joined in January 1952.  I was out of high school about two years.    Ms. Higgins: Why was the Navy in such bad shape?    Mr. O'Brien: Who knows?  I don't know that this was characteristic of the Navy in general, but I was on a small destroyer, and maybe they were on the bottom of the totem pole.  I was in during the Korean War.    Ms. Higgins: What was the name of the destroyer?    Mr. O'Brien: USS Brenner DDR 807. Home ported in Newport, Rhode Island.    Ms. Higgins: Where did you go to High School?    Mr. O'Brien: It was called Leonardo High School at that time, but used the initials MTHS (Middletown High School).  The building is still there.  As a matter of fact, right now it's under renovation.  It is one of the junior high schools in town, and they are putting a large addition on it.    Ms. Higgins: And you must have married somewhere along the line?    Mr. O'Brien: Oh, yes, somewhere along the line I fell prey.  It was after I had gotten out of the Navy and I went down to Monmouth College before it became Monmouth University and I saw this good looking red-head with a strange walk.  I happened to mention her at home one day to my brother, and he said, "Oh, that sounds like Sally.  She's a good friend of my girlfriend."  And through that combination, I was eventually reeled in.      John and Sally O'Brien, present day    Ms. Higgins: And did your brother marry the girlfriend?    Mr. O'Brien: Not that girlfriend, but he did marry another girlfriend and they eventually moved to California.  He subsequently died in Idaho.    Ms. Higgins: Were your children raised here as well?  Tell me about your children.    Mr. O'Brien: I have three boys.  The oldest son is Michael.  He is currently thirty-nine years old.  He is unmarried and still living at home.  He's had many girlfriends, but nothing seems to last.  He works in a contact lens manufacturing company as a customer service representative.  My next son is also unmarried.  At the present time, he is living in Brussels, Belgium.  He works for an international advertising outfit.  And his original assignment in the international end of it was in Mexico City, Mexico, where he spent six years. He's now completed his third year in Brussels and is in the process of moving the office to Paris.    Ms. Higgins: It doesn't sound like he has time to get married.    Mr. O'Brien: That's absolutely true.  He's probably working twelve to fourteen hours a day, sometimes six to seven days a week.  It's been a difficult time for him, but he seems to enjoy it, as long as he can keep burning the candles at both ends. He's got more power than I have. My youngest son is William, and he lives in Middletown also. He is right on the border to Atlantic Highlands. He met his wife up in New Hampshire at Franklin Pierce College. They have one son, Jacob, who was baptized last Saturday.  At long last.    Ms. Higgins: Congratulations.    Mr. O'Brien: Thank you very much.    Ms. Higgins: What are you most proud of in your life?     Mr. O'Brien: I think family.  Knowing the difficulties that we had as a family without a father, how my mother had kept us together, and kept food on the table.  I think I am most proud of the fact that I have three good sons.  They have not created any problems for us or society. They seem to be making their own way.  Not everything is perfect, neither were their parents, but I think I am most proud of the family.    Ms. Higgins: It does sound like a nice family.  It must be wonderful to have them all close by except for the one who is going overseas most of the time.  Have you been influential in any changes in Monmouth County other than being a contributing citizen?  Mr. O'Brien: Well, I don't know if I could say that I was instrumental in making any changes, but I hopefully had some influence on a lot of the young folks I spent a lot of time in soccer programs with the young people.  I spent a long time with the Boy Scouts of America as cub master for the local cub pack, and on the membership committee, and on the organizational committee for the Boy Scouts.  I used to take my summer vacations away from my family to take the troop to Forestburg, New York for two weeks because they had nobody to take them.  So I spent many summers at Forestburg being the father to twenty-five or thirty kids.     Ms. Higgins: You may well have taken our sons who are now forty-five and forty-three.  They weren't totally keen on Boy Scouts, but they stuck with it because they loved Forestburg.  It had quite an impact on their lives.  So you see here, without even knowing it, you were an influence and very much for the good.    John O'Brien BSA 1945.jpg (47596 bytes)  John O'Brien  while in the Boy Scouts of America      Mr. O'Brien: Well, the strangest thing is when you walk down a street in Red Bank, and all of a sudden somebody comes up to you and says, "Hi, Mr. O'Brien," and you look up at them and say, "I haven't the foggiest idea who you are," and he says, "Oh, I was in your cub pack or I was in your troop, my name is" And I'd say, "Gee, when I knew you, I'd look down at you and now I have to look up at you."    Ms. Higgins: Oh, I still remember those trips to Forestburg.  We have pictures of them.  Both boys would scramble to get their boy scouting obligations in order because that had to be done before one went. Well, thank you for that.  We were talking the other day with an interviewee who was very active in the Democratic Party.  Were you active in either the Republican or Democratic Party in Middletown?     Mr. O'Brien: No.  I've known people in the various parties.  I have never affiliated as far as organization goes with any one party. I like to consider myself more of an Independent, although if I look at my voting record it would probably be more weighted on the Democratic side. I kind of feel that the Democrats seem to give more to the people rather than to big businesses.  One of the problems in Middletown is that the Democrats don't seem to have any real viable candidates to run. One thing I don't like in Middletown is the fact it's been run by a one party system for so long.  I don't care which party it is, I feel we need to get both sides in there and get the voices heard.    Ms. Higgins: I also wanted to ask you if any places you have lived were owned ever by the Stout family?    Mr. O'Brien: Not that I'm aware of, but I know that when my mother was a young girl, her family had lived in one of the so-called "Bowne houses."  It is the Bowne house that is now between Route 36 and Leonardville Road down near Beacon Hill Country Club.

Emma Klass circ 1930.jpg (28193 bytes)      Ms. Higgins: Old, old family in the area.    Mr. O'Brien: Yes.  As a young girl, my mother also worked at the Rice Estate, which is now referred to as Croyden Hall.    Ms. Higgins: Your mother sounds very busy with all those children and all those jobs.    Mr. O'Brien: Yes, she was.    Ms. Higgins: She did it without a husband for most of the time.    Mr. O'Brien: An awful lot of credit goes to her for whatever it is I am today.    Ms. Higgins: Can you think of any people who have influenced your life in Monmouth County?    Mr. O'Brien: The first one that comes to mind is Father Callahan, who later became Monsignor Callahan for St. Agnes Church in Atlantic Highlands.  He sort of monitored us going through the school.  He knew that we were a family without a father and in poor financial circumstances, and so he kind of looked over our shoulder and gave us some direction.  At the time I couldn't understand why, when I lived probably the furthest from the church, I always had the earliest mass to serve. But I then found out that right after mass he brought me into the rectory and fed me breakfast.  I can remember on one particular occasion I came in, and he didn't think too much of the jacket that I was wearing. He said, "Cold weather is coming--you need something more than that. Come on down to the church basement."  And in the church basement was a collection of clothing gathered for the missions.  We went through and selected two winter jackets for me. I can remember serving mass with him where dogs would follow him all over, and a dog would come into the Sacresty and when he went on to the altar, the dog would walk to the doorway and stop, and not go into the altar  he would wait there until mass was over and Father came out.  Father would walk through Atlantic Highlands and kids would follow him all over.  He'd take them to the ice cream store and buy them ice cream.  It was never my luck, because I lived in the other direction and had to leave, but he was quite a man.  I remember him trying to keep the old church going.  I remember holes in the church floor.  He'd take Campbell's Soup cans and open them up and nail them over the holes. There were holes in the roof, and birds would be flying around during mass. He was just such an old kindly gentleman. I don't think I ever heard him raise his voice at anybody for any reason.     Ms. Higgins: So he had an influence on you, which you probably passed along yourself in certain circumstances.     Mr. O'Brien: Well, I hope whatever it was, it was good.  I heard a story at one time, somebody talking about another individual and all bad things he had done and what not.  The other individual said, "Nobody is totally bad  at least he can serve as a bad example."    Ms. Higgins: What other activities did  you and your friends do to amuse yourself?    Mr. O'Brien: Well, we ice skated but we ice skated in the swamps where it had clumps of grass through the whole thing and you couldn't skate in a straight line.  Most of these were places that were only four or five inches deep, and when they froze over we skated around there.  We did skate though at Hosfords Pond in Leonardo, which is now a housing development.  That was adjacent to the Schimmel dairy farm, but there wasn't much ice-skating done by us.  It was too far to go to get to anything  we had no transportation.    Ms. Higgins: You had good sledding on Chapel Hill.    Mr. O'Brien: Yes, we had good sledding right on the farm, and I have a child's memory.  I can remember the upper end of the farm, which was basically where we grew the corn, was a pretty good slope.  This is one memory I have with my father.  We had a big snow storm followed by sleet, and the snow was glazed over, and he took me and my brother up to the top of the slope.  The three of us together came down on a sled, but with the ice, you couldn't steer the sled.  There was a fence line along the side of the road with barbed wire on it, and the snow was up to the second strand.  Not being able to steer the sled, we headed right toward the barbed wire.  My father pushed my brother in one direction, and pulled me to jump in the other.  When we jumped off the sled, we probably went as far on our bottoms as we did on the sled, but we missed the barbed wire.    Ms. Higgins: When did you begin work?    Mr. O'Brien: Well, that was one of the problems I had in high school.  Being the oldest child, I was always expected to bring some money in to help support the house. So I was not really allowed to play sports in high school, which I really wanted to do, but I was so skinny at the time that a good wind would have blown me away, anyhow.    Ms. Higgins: All that biking.    Mr. O'Brien: But my jobs basically were cleaning cellars and cutting lawns and trimming hedges and shoveling sidewalks and that type of thing.  My first paying job was working for the A & P in Leonardo on Leonard Avenue.  This A & P was in a block of commercial stores, and it was prior to most supermarkets.  In the store you had three people: the manager, the assistant manager, and me. And it was always my job to unload the trucks.  At that time, we had to mark all the items with a stamp, so we had to do this in the back room and then load the shelves.  There were no cash registers like you have today.  People would come in and come up to the counter and then place their order with you. You would have to go get it and bring it back to the counter, then with your pencil you would write the price on the side of a brown paper bag, and when you were all done, the clerk added it all up and then charged them the money.  And I can remember a couple times in there, and hopefully this lady is no longer living, but I can remember being up on the ladder stocking the top shelves and all of a sudden the manager is saying to the assistant manager, "Come on in the back room.  I need you right now.  John, take care of the counter, will you?" and I knew immediately that Mrs. Murphy was coming. Mrs. Murphy had the reputation of out talking any truck driver in the typical truck driver language that you'd ever want to think of.    Ms. Higgins: What was Mrs. Murphy's problem?    Mr. O'Brien: She liked four letter words.    Ms. Higgins: And she would use them to a young boy?    Mr. O'Brien: Nearly anybody!  So the manager and the assistant manager were always prepared to duck out of the way. It took me about two years of working there to finally check down the roads through the window and see her coming, and every once in a while I could duck to the back.    Ms. Higgins: She apparently didn't like your merchandise or anything else.    Mr. O'Brien: No, I think it was just her manner of being.    Ms. Higgins: I'm still surprised that the manager and assistant manager would leave that for you to deal with. You must have been pretty good though, adding all those figures.    Mr. O'Brien: Well you had to  that's the way society was then. You didn't have any alternative  you didn't know any different.    Ms. Higgins: This is true.    Mr. O'Brien: You know, I don't know if it would involve any of you right now, but I had a thought tickler on the way over here today.  Talking about Mrs. Murphy reminded me.  I had NPR radio on coming in, and they were talking about collectibles.  They were talking about the Honas Wagner baseball card as being a collectible.  Wagner objected to this card being given out free because it was given out within the pack of Sweet Caporal cigarettes. Sweet Caporal cigarettes were one of the things I had to sell in the store, and I can remember the first time somebody came in and ask me for a carton of Sweet Caporal. I had no idea what it was.  "Don't you know what it is? It's under the counter."  I had to go into the back room to find out from the manager what Sweet Caporal was and then I found out they were cigarettes. It seems strange that today on the way over here, it re-tickled my memory.    Ms. Higgins: It also seems strange you didn't know.    Mr. O'Brien: Well, nobody in my family smoked, and I was not around people who smoked. I really had no idea what cigarettes were. You weren't allowed to listen to radio that much for advertising. We'd listen to Gabriel Heater and folks like that with the news, and  the "Lone Ranger", but only if your homework was done.    Ms. Higgins: How about "The FBI In Peace and War"?    Mr. O'Brien: Oh yes, and "Jack Armstrong--The All-American Boy" on Saturdays and a few of the kids' programs, "Red Rider" and a few things like that.  I can remember I guess it was about 1951.  I was already out of high school when we got our first television set, and my mother discovered professional wrestling.  EMMAOB circ 1952.jpg (91324 bytes)  Emma O'Brien, circa 1952  John O'Brien's mother    Ms. Higgins: I like your mother. I really like your mother. My son loves professional wrestling  he says I just miss all the subtleties.     Mr. O'Brien: Well, they were probably the greatest actors in the world, but anything other than that I don't know.  It's a waste of time. My mother liked Gorgeous George.    Ms. Higgins: We haven't talked much about your brother and sister.  What are they doing?    Mr. O'Brien: Well, my brother is now deceased. He moved to California and he worked for the Los Angeles Department of Transportation. He was a diesel mechanic for their buses. He smoked quite heavily and he wound up with emphysema. They moved to Idaho and he was on constant oxygen.  He eventually died with emphysema. He had a wife and several children. When my mother died, he and two of his children came North for the funeral. My sister and I were not very close. We used to battle quite a bit as kids. She'd do whatever she could to annoy me, and I could only take it so long.  I'd retaliate.  We'd both get in trouble that way. Somewhere along the line she got off track and we were a strict Catholic family.  The first occurrence that I can remember was when I was home on a weekend from the Navy and my mother was pretty well shook up.  She said that Rita had gone out with a fellow against my mother's will. I asked, "Why didn't you want her to date him?"  She said that the fellow came in the house drunk.  And while my sister was changing to go out, he pointed to my picture in uniform on top of the TV set, and his question to her was, "Who's that son of a bitch?"  My mother told him to get out of the house, went and got my sister and said, "You're not going out with him," and my sister said, "Yes, I am," and about three months later she comes in on a Saturday.  And Saturday was the great cleaning day in the house, and my mother thought my sister was still sleeping.  Rita walked down the driveway and said, "Mom, I'm leaving, I just got married."  My mother discovered that my sister had taken her clothes out of the house over the past week.  She had married this individual.  She stayed married to him for several years, then divorced, and then she married somebody else.  I'm trying to remember now: it must to be close to twenty years ago she worked in the same general area that I did, and I came in to work one day, and one of the gals was saying, "We didn't see you at the party last night."  I said, "What party was that?"  "Your sister's going away party."  "Going away where?"  "She didn't tell you she's moving to Hawaii?"  So I said, "No, as far as I know she stills lives in Eatontown."  Well, thirteen years later, I get a phone call on New Year's Day from my sister who had had a few nips, I believe, and wanted to know why I never got in touch with her. I said, "Number one, you never told me where you were or an address or that you were even going." So today we have sort of a strange relationship.  We write maybe twice a year.  During Christmas time there might be a phone call but we are not close.  The day Rita got married my mother wrote in the Bible, "Rita died this day."  She said to me, "When I die I don't want Rita at my funeral."  Now when my mother did die, I could not support that request. She was my sister and she was my mother's daughter, so I did invite her to come and she did show up.    Ms. Higgins: Another person I was interviewing went to Monmouth College when it was Monmouth Jr. College.    Mr. O'Brien: Well, that's where I started.    Ms. Higgins: It's been fun to watch that development. What did you study there?    Mr. O'Brien: I was taking electronics primarily, rather than engineering, because the electronics courses gave me more of the practical courses, and since I was going under the GI Bill, I didn't know whether I would be able to complete a four year curriculum or not, and since it was a junior college, it only offered two years.  So I figured if I only got through the first two years I would have more useful knowledge.  And at the same time in town there was a man who ran a radio/television appliance store.  He said to me that if I went into the TV repair business, he would set me up in business in his shop to do the repair work for his shop. By the time I got out of the college though, his business had gone down hill, and I could see that it was not a money making proposition, and I elected to do other things.    Ms. Higgins: Do you remember Campbell's Junction?    Mr. O'Brien: Oh, yes, that was our famous bus stop, but long prior to that, it was the trolley stop.    Ms. Higgins: Tell us about the trains that came down the coast.     Mr. O'Brien: We rode the train with my aunt quite a bit, and in later years when I had to go to New York City, I used the train.  If you were lucky, you'd get the right one right through to Matawan, and I can remember when they cut the line back and it just terminated in Highlands when the railroad bridge was out. They never put the bridge back in, so you used to get off near what was the merry-go-round in Highlands.  That was the terminal.    Ms. Higgins: I would always take my two children down to see the carousel in Highlands, and when it burned they were grief stricken. They were four and two, and they loved that carousel.  There was some speculation that the fire might have been deliberately set for the insurance.  So that's where the railroad ended.    Mr. O'Brien: The railroad bridge that went across the base of the hook came down, and I think that was by a fire also. It was never rebuilt, therefore the trains couldn't go any further. Of course in Sea Bright the tracks kept washing out anyhow, and that was before they put in the stones and barriers.    Ms. Higgins: If we only knew then what we know now about transportation, we would never have let those train lines go. Look at Route 36 in the summer.    Mr. O'Brien: They should not have.  Anyhow, they should've kept that railroad right-of-way and put in a monorail.  But eventually the track then backed up and was then terminated in Atlantic Highlands for a number of years, and then after that, they took the trains themselves off and just ran what they called bud cars which was just one car self powered.  It would run from Atlantic Highlands to Matawan and shuttle back and forth.  In 1944 we moved within a block of the railroad station.  Coming from a farm and moving down where the trains kept coming by was a change.  It took a long time to get used to those train whistles and the clack-a-de-clack of a train going by.    Ms. Higgins: Is St. Agnes Church still in Atlantic Highlands?    Mr. O'Brien: Yes, but it's the new church now that was built during the time that I was in the Navy.  They tore down the old church because it was just too decrepit to repair and was not big enough for the parish.    Ms. Higgins: What do you remember about Atlantic Highlands?     Mr. O'Brien: Well, as far as the town goes, I remember primarily Center Ave. which was where the new church is now, and the St. Agnes School that I went to.  And then we had the Jones Store which was a little mom and pop candy type store.  When we went out at lunch time from school everybody ran down there.  The movie theater was in Atlantic Highlands, which up until maybe my late teens was the only movie house I was ever into. First movie I ever saw there was Gone With the Wind.     Ms. Higgins: What a wonderful way to start movie going.     Mr. O'Brien: Well, my cousin who lived in the farm at the top of Chapel Hill who was about two, two and a half years older than myself, took me to the first movie and it was an afternoon matinee.  And I can remember when I saw the pictures of the soldiers on the battlefield dying with guns going off, I just covered my eyes and put my head down and said, "Tell me when that's over."  But when we used go in there, I think it cost us twenty cents to get into the movies. We had a quarter and we'd go to the penny candy store next door and buy penny candies up to five cents and the old fellow that ran that store didn't trust anybody.  He walked around behind to make sure you didn't put something in your pocket, and would say, "You've been in here too long.  Time for you to get out."  The town grouch.     Ms. Higgins: Was that hardware store there when you were growing up?    Mr. O'Brien: Yes, Siegfried's Hardware Store. If they didn't have nobody had it.     Ms. Higgins: That's right.  You'd go in with some archaic old appliance and ask them for a little screw and they'd disappear in the back.    Mr. O'Brien: And come right out with it.    Ms. Higgins: Yes.  Absolutely amazing place.    Mr. O'Brien: It is still there today. It's under new ownership, of course, but it's still there today.    Ms. Higgins: Was the ferry going back and forth?    Mr. O'Brien: I don't even remember the name of it now.  It wasn't the City of Keansburg but they used to run the boats from Battery Park down to the pier in Atlantic Highlands and then people would get on a train to go to Monmouth Park Racetrack.  But in my time the paddle wheelers were long gone.      Ms. Higgins: It was the City of Keansburg I was thinking of.    Mr. O'Brien: Yes that used to run to Keansburg.  It was pretty efficient.    Ms. Higgins: Why did that stop?    Mr. O'Brien: I think the boats themselves just got too old and ridership went down with the train service that was there.    Ms. Higgins: And the pier was decrepit.    Mr. O'Brien: The pier in Atlantic Highlands eventually caught on fire, and I believe the Gelhaus family had owned that, and they decided not to rebuild it because they were running bus lines.  It was probably a series of things, but basically I think it came down to economics.    Ms. Higgins: During the time when you and Sally were young parents, if you wanted to get dressed up and go out to a restaurant, where would you go?    Mr. O'Brien: Cedar Inn, Highlands, on Route 36.  If you were headed south, it was just before you got to the bridge.  It was on the right hand side with a very small parking lot.  And in our family we have a very fond memory of it.  Our oldest son was about  two and half years old, and was still sitting in a highchair.  We went in there one night for dinner, and my wife had ordered pork chop for our son.  The waitress said, "Would you like to have a child's portion?"  "Not for Michael."  No, he ate that entire pork chop and said, "Mommy I'm hungry."  We called the waitress back and ordered the second pork chop, and he ate that while the five waitresses that were in the place stood around watching.  Today this man is six feet six and about 330 pounds.     Ms. Higgins: A lot of pork chops.    Mr. O'Brien: He had a good start.    Ms. Higgins: Well, that's so much fun to hear about the Cedar Inn.    Mr. O'Brien: My wife used to like Alaskian King crab legs.  My mother used to talk about the amusement park on the Bayshore.  It used to be in Atlantic Highlands down opposite what is a boat yard now, and they put in some housing developments, but it was on the Leonardo side of what now is the harbor.  And they used to have Ferris wheels, and they had roller coaster rides. Some of the pictures of the folks on the beach at that time show the women in their bathing suits up to their necks and down to their ankles. And the men had heavy wool bathing suits.  Seems like if they ever went in above their waist, they would sink.    Ms. Higgins: From Leonardo could you see the New York skyline?    Mr. O'Brien: When we were up on the farm we could.  We moved in 1944 and that in itself is a story.  In 1942 Earle came in, this was the Naval Ammunition Depot.  And through the Right of Eminent Domain they came in and condemned all of the property and then gave you a flat fee for your home and told you to pack and get out.  In 1943, our family home was basically a bungalow.  My mother didn't have enough money to go out and purchase something else, and after they fixed a price on the property and the house,  they offered you the right to buy the house back at a very low figure, but then you had to move it.  My mother elected to do that.  She had a friend who owned a small piece of property fifty by 100 in downtown Leonardo. We purchased that piece of property, hired a mason to put a foundation under it, and then she hired the "One-Man House Mover: Duffy Fisher," a Black house mover from Middletown, who single-handedly moved the house from the Chapel Hill location to its location now directly opposite what is the post office in Leonardo.  But the day of the move itself is a memory burned into our minds.  On a Sunday, the house had been jacked up off the foundation and placed on the flat bed truck, but it wasn't to be moved until Monday.  It was a hot day.  We had walked to St. Agnes Church, fasting since midnight.  We walked all the way back and when we got there, there was no house!  The house had completely disappeared, so we figured somebody was taking it to its new location unannounced.  Then we had to retreat and head back on the route where it was going to go.  We found it stuck on the railroad tracks at Appleton Ave. in Leonardo because it was on a slight incline.  As we approached it, the train was pulling out of the station in Leonardo headed directly for the house, which was hung-up on the rails by the back steps. There was a man on the roof of the house with a pole to hold the power wires up so they could go underneath it. He jumped off the house, grabbed an ax, and chopped the back steps off of the house so they could pull the house off the tracks before the train got there.  So that's how we lost the back steps.    Ms. Higgins: Oh that's a wonderful story.    Mr. O'Brien: In the meantime, here we are dying of thirst, you can't get in the house, it takes them another hour and a half to get it down to the place. The foundation wasn't in, so they had to back it on the property and prop it up.  Luckily there was a neighbor next door who let us use the hose. And it was fun for the next month and a half with the china pot and the apple orchard across the street.    Ms. Higgins: What do you mean?    Mr. O'Brien: We had no running water in the house  we had no lavatory, so you had a china pot and the china pot had to be dumped somewhere.    Ms. Higgins: What year was that?    Mr. O'Brien: 1944.    Ms. Higgins: Do you remember in that Chapel Hill area a little lighthouse?    Mr. O'Brien: There's a lighthouse on the beach and there was one up in Chapel Hill.    Ms. Higgins: Chapel Hill in the woods.     Mr. O'Brien: Yes, up on the top of Chapel Hill there was a lighthouse. There was a couple who lived there and maintained the lighthouse up until the time that it was put out of service.  And even that has a story.  This was above Hosfords Pond, and you had to go past the cemetery, past the pond, up the hill, and in either October or November of that year--and I don't remember exactly what year it was, but it was in the late forties--we had walked up that hill and found that there had been a large fir tree knocked over by a hurricane that had fallen directly across the road just below the lighthouse.  My mother knew the people living in the lighthouse.  We were friends, and we were going up to visit.  So when we got home, my mother said, "There's a good place to get a Christmas tree.  The tree's already down. Why don't we go up and take the top of the tree and use it for our Christmas tree?"  Which we did.  The next day the State Police came to the door and accused us of chopping down a tree and taking it.  His evidence was a child's mitten, one mitten which was too small for any of us, and was not one of ours, but he refused to accept any information that we had to show him where we had taken the tree.  He just gave us a warning: "Don't ever do this again."  Now opposite that lighthouse there was an old estate that only had the foundation left.  It had a couple of clay tennis courts that were getting pretty old and run down, and during that period of time it was the local boy scout summer camp for St. Agnes and a couple of the other troops in the area. We camped there a number of times.    Ms. Higgins: Would that have included Highlands Boy Scouts?     Mr. O'Brien: It could very well have been.    Ms. Higgins: What were some of the medical practices when you were growing up?    Mr. O'Brien: The one that immediately comes to mind for me was the treatment for poison ivy.  There was a Dr. Opperman (I believe his name was) in Atlantic Highlands.  Any time we had to go the doctor we went there, and he used to treat you with some sort of a salve and then give you these little tiny white perfectly round pills the size or slightly smaller of a b-b and it was supposed to remove the itch. Today looking back at I think in reality they were candy.  I think they were what we know as a placebo today. But the doctor's practices at that time were that if you couldn't get to the doctor's office, the doctor would come to the house. But of course you had to pay for it, and so rarely did we go to a doctor other for a tonsillectomy or something of that nature.  I can remember my grandmother referring to hospitals as "horsepitals" and nobody ever went to a "horsepital" unless you were going to die, so the attitude toward medical practice wasn't too good. You kind of felt that it was your last chance.  But the only time we really got any exceptional medical treatment, I guess were in school physical exams, and then if they found something wrong, you were referred to a doctor.    Ms. Higgins: But you all grew up on a farm and you must have hurt yourself occasionally?  What did you do then?    Mr. O'Brien: Well, hurt in those days and hurting today are entirely different.  Today everybody runs to the doctor for everything.  At that time, wash it up, and put a bandage on it was normal. To this day I have a large scar on my ankle.  We had gone out one evening to visit neighbors up near the top of the hill. I had a little red wagon. The hubcap on one side of the wagon was missing, and the cotter pin was sticking through.  We had a habit of coming down the hill: you'd put one foot in the wagon, grab the steering handle, and use the other foot like a scooter to come down.  Well, I had my brother in the wagon.  I was trying to steer around him, but hit a rock and swung sideways, and cotter pin went in my ankle and just tore all the way down the side.  And there's about a four, four and a half-inch scar there now.  My mother had been a nurse, so when we got home she just cleaned it all off and put a gauze bandage on it and wrapped it up tight.  Everyday we'd clean it and put salve on it.  And the thing that I can remember from that is when it healed and the final gauze came off, some of the gauze strings were healed inside of the scar and I had to sit there with a pair of tweezers and try to pull these strings out through the scar.    Ms. Higgins: What was your mother's name?    Mr. O'Brien: Emma Florence Klass.    Ms. Higgins: A nurse, too!    Mr. O'Brien: Well, it starts even stranger than that.  She originally started off in a convent to be a nun.  GparentsKlass.jpg (112555 bytes)    The Klass family, circa 1930s.  John O'Brien's Uncle George (standing), Mr. O'Brien's maternal grandparents (sitting), and the young girl is John O'Brien's Aunt Helen.       Ms. Higgins: Is Class spelled with a "C" or a "K"?    Mr. O'Brien: That depends on which document you want to look at  she uses K.  K is on the tombstones, but letters that I have received from the relatives in Germany all use the capital C. Sometimes you see the children's names listed in a group and some will have C and some will have K.    Ms. Higgins: Was she an immigrant?      Mr. O'Brien: My mother was born here, but her parents were immigrants.     Ms. Higgins: When did she decide to become a nurse?    Mr. O'Brien: Let's see.  Did she become a nurse first or a nun?  I think she went in to be a nurse first and then she decided to become a nun.  Why she left I don't know, but I believe it was through economic reasons of the family.    Ms. Higgins: Then she met your father?    Mr. O'Brien: Apparently.    Ms. Higgins: And there went the nunnery.  What newspaper headlines stand out in your mind from Monmouth County in the past century?    Mr. O'Brien: Oh I think, VE Day, VJ Day.  That time the papers that we got were basically on Sundays.  We didn't get a paper during the week.  The local paper at that time was basically a weekly anyhow  it only came out on Thursdays.  It was the Red Bank Register.  It came out once a week.  And then it moved out here, right down the street from where we are now.     Ms. Higgins: It's not The Register anymore.  But when that would come Thursday, what would you read first?    Mr. O'Brien: The movies, all the want ads that were in there, and help wanted, and all the good stuff. Who hit John and who got divorced, who got married.  There was a recent article in the paper which recalled a memory that I had seen in the paper at that time.  That was when the ship blew up at the Earle Pier in 1946. I was in eighth grade in St. Agnes School at the time.  The State Police had a system of safety patrols. You had a brass plaque that you wore on your sleeve with an elastic strap around it, and you were in fact, the crossing guard.  At lunch time on this day, I was at the Avenue D and Center Ave. crossing as a safety guard, and this loud explosion went off.  You could feel the whole ground shake.  And this was from the explosion at Earle, and I believe it was just about a week ago there was a picture of that ship, or two pictures of that ship, in one of the local papers.     Ms. Higgins: You mentioned that you used to listen to radio programs after your homework was done.  Please describe any other favorite childhood games that you used to enjoy.    Mr. O'Brien: Well, basically throwing a ball, having the dog chase it, and then chase the dog to get the ball back.  My brother and I used to play baseball a fair amount.  Again it is a memory of St. Agnes Grammar School that makes me laugh every time I think of it. We had a playground which was across the street from the church, a half a block from the school.  It was actually a fifty by one hundred lot that the church owned between a house and what was then the Andy Richards Estate.  In the Andy Richards Estate close to this empty lot which was basically our playground, he raised chickens. The chickens would get out in the high grass and they'd lay their eggs out there.  Well, we were out there one day playing ball and somebody hit a foul ball into that grass, and one of the kids went in there and discovered these nice eggs warm from the sun.  He picked up a couple and started throwing them back toward the rest of us, and you can imagine the smell when they hit, so I said, "Not for me," and I ran into the lot next door and I hid behind a big tree.  The next thing I know somebody throws an egg, missed the kids on the field, hit my tree, broke, and fell right on the top of my head.  I couldn't stand myself.  I had to go over to the school trying to scrub it all off.  I had to get one of the kids to get one of the nuns to come out.  I said, "I'm going home."  She said, "Yes, you'd better."  I had three miles to go in the hot sun with a rotten egg on my head.  It's not my choice of having a happy day.  Play Ground 1945.jpg (56999 bytes)  The playground at St. Agnes Grammar School,  circa 1945    Ms. Higgins: The memory seems to linger on.    Mr. O'Brien: Hopefully, it's the memory and not the smell.    Ms. Higgins: In what way do you feel your life is now different than you thought it might be?    Mr. O'Brien: Well, probably the economy and closeness of people around. I came from basically a small family and married into a large family, and now that we're getting up in years, you see the family shrink and diminish again.  It's like coming full circle.  But in my growing up time, you could go out on the streets at anytime you wanted to, they didn't have paved shoulders, and there wasn't that much traffic.  Today you take your life in your hands to go out on the street whether you're walking or in a car or anything else, and I'm not so sure all of this is for the good.  But we have more things to get involved in today and more things that need your help.  There is very little that we had that were considered temptations in those days and today that seems to be all you see.  Consider the junk that's on TV for the kids to look at today.  I feel sorry for parents today  they have to be far more vigilant than we ever had to be.    Ms. Higgins: If you had one thing that you wanted to leave with people listening to this over the next hundred years, and I sincerely hope this archive will be listened to and read for a long time, what would you say? What would you like to leave with the present and future generations as your values and your concerns about the next millennium?    Mr. O'Brien: Basically, I think family is everything, that includes religion, whatever religion you are.  Live up to your ideals and your goals, do what you think is right, not what the society tells you is the norm. That doesn't necessarily mean its right.  God gave us all the brain to know right from wrong  live up to it.  Decide where you can help your fellow man.     Ms. Higgins: What was your career?    Mr. O'Brien: Well, I continued at Monmouth College for my degree in electronics but the college did not get its four-year accreditation in engineering the following year. Under the GI Bill, I had one option: either change my course curriculum or change my college. If I wanted to stay in the same curriculum I would have to go to NCE, Newark College of Engineering, which now has a different name.    Ms. Higgins: Newark College of Engineering.    Mr. O'Brien: Right, but in order to get there, I'd have to use the train.  Now I was going to Monmouth College five nights a week. To go by train, I would lose almost three hours a night class time, and I wouldn't be able to go five nights a week so it would take me much longer to get my degree. So, I elected to change my curriculum, but the college did not have a four-year accreditation. But about that time I met the gal who has become my wife. I had taken a full-time job and was then at Fort Monmouth.  I was working in the electronics area, and I was doing pretty well, so I decided to hold off another year and hopefully the college would come in with the accreditation at that time.  It did not, but then I got married and had other commitments, and I never really went back to it.  But I've had a pretty good career. I was lucky enough to be in the right place at the right time with enough people who thought enough of me to make my way in the world. Although I would never be a millionaire, I've never planned to be, and I don't know what I would ever do if I ever was.  We survived. The biggest thing was to get the children educated and out on their own. And for the most part I think we've done that.    Ms. Higgins: Can you describe any stories that have passed down through the generations?    Mr. O'Brien: Well there's very little on the Irish side.  I find more with doing my genealogy and refuting things that I had heard or not heard.  As an example, I know that my father's mother came from Keansburg and I knew that she had a sister who was approximately a year younger than her, but that's all I knew about her.  From doing my genealogy I've discovered at least five brothers that she had and possibly several more that might have been born in Ireland.  But the Irish at that time were so pleased to be out of Ireland with what was going on there, they didn't really talk about it.  Cameras were not that prolific, so you didn't have many pictures.  It was not our opportunity to be around with them when they were talking, so we really had nothing in the way of word of mouth.  On my German side, everybody seemed to hold a grudge against somebody.  And I know this aunt who took us all around had some ongoing battle with my mother for years, and every time I'd ask my mother, "What's the problem with you and Aunt Rose?" the answer was always the same: "It's none of your business."    Ms. Higgins: Doesn't make so much family history.    Mr. O'Brien: Not much in the way of verbal history, no.    Ms. Higgins: And I would also like to ask you about your milestones.    Mr. O'Brien: Well, I would say probably the first thing that I could recall is making my first communion at St. Agnes, then graduating from St. Agnes, graduating from Middletown High School. And our fiftieth reunion is coming up next year so that will be a milestone. Going into the Navy, getting a first decent job, getting out of the Navy, which was sort of an adverse milestone, it was not something I wanted to happen at the time but it was a medical reason, and I couldn't fight it. Of course one of the biggest things in my life was getting married, finding the number one gal in the country.    Ms. Higgins: If you could wave a wand and be back in Monmouth County in 1948 and direct Monmouth County development, what would you say?  We really should've kept the train.    Mr. O'Brien: Absolutely.  More needed to be done for public transportation, but before you could proceed the parkway came in and there was probably no way you would've known at that time other than by hind sight. Within Middletown, one of the things I wish they had done was to set aside some sort of a commercial area where tax ratables would've come in to help the homeowners and not just be known strictly as a bedroom community.  I think there needed to be more done in preserving some of our historical areas.  Particularly things like the fishing industry.     Ms. Higgins: How about education in Middletown?    Mr. O'Brien: Well, I went to St. Agnes Grammar School, but I went to the public high school, and the reason I went to the public high school was probably more economy than anything else.  The Catholic grammar school was affiliated with the church that we belonged to: however, they did not have a high school, and we were then in the St. James district, but being out of the parish we had to pay tuition, and my mother just could not afford it, and so we went to the public high school.  I think I got a decent education at Middletown High School.  There were a couple of things that I wished they had changed.  Some of those I think they needed to have a course in economics -- just teaching people how to run a checkbook, which unless you were taking the Home Economics and the secretarial courses, which were mostly for the girls, that was never even broached.  My first classroom at Leonardo High School was in the agriculture building.  Today people necessarily don't even understand agriculture. They go out and buy a plant that's already in bloom, they take it home, and water it twice, and throw it in the garbage, and tomorrow go out and buy another one.    Ms. Higgins: Do you remember the Middletown Library?     Mr. O'Brien: In several different locations.  At one time it was in the building that's on Kings Highway, which is now a private home.  It had been the telephone building at one time and it gradually moved from place to place to place until it finally got its own home and there's a nice group that supports the Library called the Friends of the Middletown Library.  My wife and I are members.  You had a couple of book sales there every year to help support the library and buy different things.  I'm very proud of the Middletown Library system.  However, I do wish there were some way that within the county and town, even though we have our own library system, we could have an easier access to use the county library facilities.  I don't know what the fee is today  it's a nominal fee to buy your membership.  I used to go there quite a bit for the Sunday programs, but I don't know if they are still going on.  I know they were there for a while.  Middletown has several branch libraries where, when our kids were growing up, they had fantastic programs reading and teaching the children.  They bring in classes and they read them stories or have them participate in reading stories and acting out stories and I think that went on a long way towards teaching kids that there's more than watching television or running around a ball field.    Ms. Higgins: Do you remember the Navesink Library near the Little Red Store?     Mr. O'Brien: I remember the library, but I don't remember using it as a library, but in the back of the library is a theater, and the Monmouth Players have been there for many, many years and for many, many years we were patrons of that and we went to many of their plays.    Ms. Higgins: Did you ever act yourself?    Mr. O'Brien: No.    Ms. Higgins: I can tell you're a reader.    Mr. O'Brien: Well, I read as much as I can but I don't read as much as I should.  I'm spending too much time on a computer now and my eyes are starting to go after a while.  Most of my memories now are of things that have been created through my genealogy.  I would like to see more genealogy available to us.  You had mentioned the Mormon Church History Center.  If some of that material that pertains to the area could be in our own files, that would be good.  I know we have the Monmouth County Historical Society.  I used to be a member until they priced me out.  Randall Gabrielan, who is the Middletown historian, has written several of those books, and in the Rumson book and one of the Middletown books he has a couple of pictures  that came from my wife's records.  Her family is an old family here.  Matter of fact, her family goes back to John Cook, the founder of the Red Bank Register.    Ms. Higgins: Mr. O'Brien, tell us some more memories of the farm.      Mr. O'Brien: The O'Brien farm was in Chapel Hill in the Leonardo section of Middletown. It was a farm of approximately twenty-two acres. It had vegetables, fruit, berries  it did not have any livestock per se, but it was a cultivated land, other than the orchard.  My home was on a corner acre of that piece of property, which had a little truck garden behind it.  We left there in 1943 when Earle came in.  At that time it was used as a sort of buffer zone for the Navy, and was not really used for anything. Our house had been moved off the property, and my grandmother's farmhouse, and the out buildings, I believe, were burned down some ten or twelve years later, leaving vacant land. Approximately fifteen years ago, in the early 1980s to mid 1980s, I had the occasion to work with a naval captain who was a good friend of the then commander of Earle.  Through him I was able to get permission to go in and look at the old farmland.  Once we got there, and I say "we" because my wife and my cousins also went, we discovered that it was now a forest.  You would never know it had been cultivated land.  Of my grandmother's farm, we found the stone foundation with no mortar, but it had all been filled in and nothing was left.  In my child's memory, I remember the laneway coming in off of Chapel Hill Road went past the side of the house and up to a three-bay open garage.  Behind it followed a pathway which went past the three-holer down to the barn.  Beyond the barn was a cultivated field, and beyond that the meadows up to the stream.  Going in the opposite direction about ninety degrees, you went up the hill where the cornfields and cabbage fields were, then up to the orchard and berries.  The Chapel Hill Road, which came past the house, made a ninety degree turn at the upper end of that orchard.  As I remember with my child's mind, the upper end of that field was about eight or ten feet above the road level, and we as kids used to slide down it into the road.  Well, when I got back there in the mid 1980s, I found that the distance between the farm house and the stream below the meadow was about one third of the distance my memory said it was! Everything was so much closer together, it was difficult to imagine how it was all crammed in there.  Got up into the orchard area, and found that the upper edge of this orchard ground--that my memory said was eight or ten feet above the road level--was now about two feet above the road.  You couldn't slide down it  it was only just one big step.  I was remembering something entirely different.  It was just strange to see that in a child's mind.  We also got up to my cousin's farm house at the upper end, and the cistern that my cousin had first shown me how to make apple jack in was all filled in, and you could only find some stones of the foundation.  Very little left of their property, either.  But the amazing thing was that in those forty some odd years, the acreage went from cultivated land to in effect a forest today. This is almost incomprehensible. It makes you think that at the time these people bought the property in the first place, it was wooded land like this.  How, with the implements available at that time, were they able to clear it and cultivate it? It's phenomenal, the strength these people had.  We also saw the outhouse where you answered nature's call. The clean up procedure was basically a Sears Roebuck catalog hanging on a nail in the wall, and if you were the lucky one, you didn't get the shiny pages. Summertime is a little bit disastrous though, because the yellow jackets seem to like that nice warm human atmosphere down below, and it was very ginger sitting down.  You weren't sure whether you would have to get up in a hurry or not.     Ms. Higgins: America is such a fascinating place here  we are talking about outhouses and our childhood and not only our children but we are now communicating throughout the world with computers. Do you have a computer now?    Mr. O'Brien: Yes, I do. I spend an awful lot of time on line trying to do genealogy stuff, but I'm involved in so many organizations that I use it primarily for keeping membership records and putting out newsletters.  I don't get the time to do the genealogy work that I want to do. I keep saying I'm gonna cut back on some of these activities and do that, and every time I do, I seem to take on another job.    Ms. Higgins: What are your organizations?    Mr. O'Brien: I belong to the National Association of Retired Federal Employees, which is a national organization which then breaks down into state federations and individual chapters.  I'm involved in a local chapter. I've been just about every officer in it. I'm currently the legislative officer and the membership chairman. I'm also involved in the newsletter committee.  Tied with that, I'm now tied with the New Jersey Federation of NARFE, and I've just recently taken on their newsletter responsibility. I also belong to the Irish Federation of Monmouth County.  We want to keep the Irish traditions alive, and so we schedule annual trips to the Irish Catskills to hear a lot of Irish music. We run three dances a year. We have a dance coming up in October. We march in the Belmar St. Patrick's Day parade. We have monthly meetings. We have annual picnics, and all these things are man power intensive, and my wife and I are involved in all of the above.    Ms. Higgins: Wow.    Mr. O'Brien: We're also involved in our church. Right now the church has what they call the Renew 2000 Program which is a program trying to bring people back to Bible reading and getting back into the better things in life. And these involve small group Bible readings and discussion.  My wife and I are small group leaders of that. And it originally started back around 1984 for five seasons  each season is six weeks. We were group leaders then, we're now into season three of the new season, and we're still group leaders.  One of the things they say about a good leader is that you can get a member of your group to become a group leader next time. My wife and I are total failures. Nobody wants to leave our group.  Primarily my interest is in genealogy. My folks, to the best that I can determine, came over here during the potato famine time.  The concept of the potato famine seems to be in most peoples' minds is the fact that there was a blight of the potatoes in Ireland, and therefore the people died because they had nothing else to eat. In reality, the British forced the deaths on the people by taking the other foods out of Ireland and using them in England.  Therefore, the Irish natives only had the potato to rely on. The British came in and cut out any official Catholic religion, so that all the religion had to be done by priests on horseback.  The potato famine itself is sort of a misconception in a lot of peoples' minds.  There was a blight on the potato, but it was not the main cause of the deaths and of the people leaving the country.  It was probably a good kick in the tail to get people moving, but there were other solutions to the problem at the time but they were just not allowed.     Ms. Higgins: Something comes to mind: an Irish party I went to in the 1960s at Bucky Smith's. That was a great party.     Mr. O'Brien: Well, Bucky Smith is no longer with us, but he's been a great member of the community.  He opened his place to all sorts of groups for different reasons. I know we've had a number of communion breakfasts there. We've had a number of dances there, and our cub scouts used to have many of our blue and gold dinners there. I believe it's his niece who is still running the place now, and they did carry on a lot of that tradition.  But of course at the same time that gives people a certain connotation: "Oh, you're going to Bucky Smith's.  Are you going to get that sliced thin ham?"  That's his only menu.    Ms. Higgins: It was underwater a lot, being so nearby the bay.  It would flood a lot.  I do remember that he was very generous.     Mr. O'Brien: A block and a half away was a home that was lived in by the lady I mentioned earlier in the interview, the sister of my father's mother who came from Keansburg.  She had one sister that I was aware of, this was the one sister, and she lived right near Bucky Smith's.    Ms. Higgins: Well, your background seems to have encompassed a lot: the farming, the shore, a lot of changes that have been in Monmouth County.     Mr. O'Brien: Well, one of the changes has to do with working on the farm. My uncle used to have a farm produce delivery service, and he would take his vegetables, and make a regular route, and of course one of the first stops on the route was Murphy's Tavern.  I had to sit in the truck until he came out.  But then we'd go down and deliver vegetables to various places. But during the summertime, every Friday night we'd load up the truck with all of his vegetables and fruits and berries and we'd go to Bradley Beach to the Farmers Market.  The Farmers Market was a fantastic place. All the farmers in the surrounding area would come in and they'd set up their stalls on Friday night and sell their vegetables up until about 11:00 or 11:30 when the crowd would leave. You'd go to sleep in your vehicle or under your vehicle or up against the lamppost or wherever you could find room. You'd open up early Saturday morning and sell until your produce was exhausted, and then you would leave.  I used to go with my uncle, and my cousin, who had the farm up the hill from us, used to go with his father. And we'd wait until the old folks went to sleep.  Then we'd walk around the block where there was an all night cigar store.  My cousin was about two years or two and half years older than myself, and he instigated me.  We'd pool all our money when we went in and buy a pack of cigarettes. And we'd walk around the block, each smoking one cigarette or thought we were smoking a cigarette.  But who's going to hide the pack of cigarettes until next week?  So one week, he would take them home, and the next week, I would take them home and hide them.     Ms. Higgins: They must have been awful by the end of summer.     Mr. O'Brien: I hid them in my top drawer of the dresser, my sock drawer.  I don't think they were in there more than fifteen or twenty minutes and my mother found them. She laced me up one side and down the other, and she said, "The one thing I can't stand is a sneak.  If you're going to smoke, smoke out in the open. But I'd better not see you smoke."  Well, the cigarettes went back to my cousin, and to this day I have never had another cigarette.    Ms. Higgins: What kind of produce did you grow?     Mr. O'Brien: Well, it was basically a vegetable farm, but it had a lot of fruits and berries, and then you had corn, cabbage, potatoes, of course, lettuce.  I don't remember anything like zucchini or anything of that nature.    Ms. Higgins: Was farming your grandfather's sole source of income?     Mr. O'Brien: Well, yes, but my grandfather was dead by the time I was there.  This was one of my father's brothers.  As a matter of fact, there were two brothers still living on the farm, but only one was able to work the farm. The older of the two had polio as a young man, and he was down in Allenwood Hospital for a number of years, and as a result of that, he wound up with one leg shorter than the other, and he wasn't able to do a lot of physical work. And he had a craft, I guess you would say, that somehow today I seem to do the same kind of thing.  I'm wondering if I didn't get it from him. He used to make these little lawn ornaments that you see in different peoples' yards, like the little girl with sprinkling can with a dotted cap and things of that nature. But the thing that I remember about him the most is his ingenuity.  He took one of those old Singer sewing machines, where you had the foot pedal, and took the sewing mechanism out and put a straight coping sawblade in it.  He made a coping saw that operated with a foot pedal, and he cut all these things out real nice, and did all the painting.  In downtown Leonardo there was a real-estate office, and he had made a model house that people today would probably say was something like a doll house.  It was on display in their window for probably fifty years. The man could do almost anything with his hands. There is a story with him that I need to research and find the details on.  He had worked at one time in, I believe it was in Morgan, in a black powder factory, and sometime in the mid 1940s, I believe it was, the place blew up.  I'd like to find more information about that, but just haven't had the time to do it.    Ms. Higgins: The Monmouth County Historical Association used to have all the local newspapers.  I don't know if they still do. The real newspapers took up rooms and rooms, and then they got wet.     Mr. O'Brien: Well, I went through their Red Bank Registers for a story that I was trying to track down for years.  This has to do with my German side of the family.  I have a series of letters written from Germany in the 19 teens. In several of the letters, they commented, "Sorry for your recent disasters, sorry for your bad time, sorry for your problem."  But you never find out what the problem was.  One day I just happened to run into somebody who said they were going through old issues of The Register and had seen something about a house fire.  I traced that down, and sure enough, my mother's parents were renting a house on Appleton Ave. in Leonardo, and the article in the paper said the house had caught fire, and that the family got out with nothing but the clothing on their backs.  In the case of my grandfather, he got out with the vest and the trousers of a brand new suit he had bought the day before, but the jacket was lost in the fire.  That I read in The Red Bank Register.  At that point and time it leads me to something else I haven't been able to track down.  The same article indicated that "Mr. Magee will hold a benefit at his theater in Atlantic Highlands, the Lyric Theater, on tomorrow evening."  I have not been able to identify the theater as yet, although recently I attended a presentation and one of the fellows who was talking about an actor who lived in what I knew as the Andy Richard's Estate, and that he put on plays in the Lyric Theater.  I've got to get to the Straus house in Atlantic Highlands to see what they might have on the Lyric Theater.    Ms. Higgins: I'm glad we had this opportunity to hear your stories.  I love your stories  they are just so Irish, and so Monmouth County!    Mr. O'Brien: Thank you very much.  Good luck.    
MonmouthCounty;John Livingstone;1926;2000;John Livingstone, 1926, 2000        Remembering The 20th Century: An Oral History of Monmouth County      John Livingstone, former director of Monmouth County Library, 1989  Date of Interview: March 13, 2000  Name of Interviewer: Rhoda Newman  Premises of Interview: Mr. Livingstone's home, Ocean Grove, NJ  Birthdate of Subject: November 6, 1926    Ms. Newman: Mr. Livingstone is presently the State Librarian of New Jersey, and was formerly the Director of the Monmouth County Library. When did you first come to Monmouth County, Jack?    Mr. Livingstone: Well, I came to Monmouth County as a kid, actually. My parents bought a summer home right here in Ocean Grove: 32 Heck Avenue. It was known as the Livingstone, and we had eighteen rooms. This was back in the early 1940s, the World War II period. Of course, everything was a lot different in those days. We were here in the summertime, we got to know Ocean Grove by coming here for vacations at a place on Embury Avenue the next street over. My parents liked it so they bought the Heck Avenue place, which is still there.    Ms. Newman: Where did you live the rest of the year?    Mr. Livingstone: In Philadelphia. We were among the few Philadelphians who came to North Jersey, actually. And I really got to enjoy Ocean Grove as a kid. I worked in the casino in Asbury Park during the summer  I worked in the Sampler Inn one summer as a bus boy - we were right across the street from the Sampler Inn, which, of course, is still there. I can still remember going in the casino. They had a ballroom on the ocean side, and they had a big band there on the weekends, and probably during the week, I can't remember how many nights during the week. I can still remember one man as though he were there today: a bald headed guy who was a terrific jitterbugger. He used to enter all the jitterbug contests, and I couldn't even dance in those days. I used to sit up there and enjoy the music. It was a lively area then. Asbury was in its prime, really, with the big hotels all over the place. In fact, the father of a good friend of mine who has a meat market in Loch Arbor was also in the meat business, a butcher, and he tells me that he used to come into Asbury Park in the summertime with a truck and just go from hotel to hotel dropping off tons of meat in each one of these places. There were a dozen or more big hotels -    Ms. Newman: The hotels all had dining rooms.    Mr. Livingstone: They had dining rooms, yes. At Berkeley Carteret, they used to have an open garden area where people would sit and eat and drink in the evening. I can remember peeking through the fence listening to Tommy Tucker's band. Those kinds of bands were here in those days. And the Paramount Theater, which is still there, was a nice place in that time. WJLK was on the boardwalk at Convention Hall. You'd walk out over the ocean and there was the studio WJLK. I remember that.    Ms. Newman: You came each summer?    Mr. Livingstone: We came each summer, yes, but we sold the place right after World War II. After I got married, Marlene and I used to come down here sometimes in the summertime, but I didn't get down here again, really, for a long period until 1968 - when I came here to become the Monmouth County Library Director. We were living outside of Philadelphia then. By that time I was married and had four children.    Ms. Newman: Where had you gone to Library school?    Mr. Livingstone: I went to Temple University and then to Drexel. But it was a long time between Temple and library school because I was doing other things.    Ms. Newman: Librarianship is a second career for a lot of different people.    Mr. Livingstone: Right. Actually it was fourteen years before I went to library school.     Ms. Newman: What made you decide?    Mr. Livingstone: Well, believe it or not, I had an Atlantic service station for ten years on Roosevelt Boulevard in Philadelphia in the Northeast section, a very busy place. It was open twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, three hundred and sixty five days a year, and I was just getting worn out. It was tiring. I quit doing that work, and a good customer of mine, who was a teacher in New Jersey, suggested that I look into librarianship. And I said, "What are you talking about, librarianship for a man?" "Yes, yes, we have some in our school system, they're paying better salaries, you can afford -" So I went down to Drexel and took a course at night. It was the worst course I could have possibly taken, for me, anyway. Cataloging. And I knew nothing about any of this stuff. Somehow I muddled through that course and I said to Marlene, "Well, if I'm going to make a change, I better sell the business and go full time. Because if I keep the business, it will take six years, I can't take that many courses, I don't have the time. By that time I'll be too old to do anything." So that's what I did. I sold the business, went to Drexel full time and started, strangely enough, working at the State library in Trenton. It was my first library job, in 1965. I was older than anybody else who was starting, and I had a family, so I was very, very gung ho. I would have done anything. I didn't know what I was doing, but I worked on the Reference Desk, and that phone couldn't ring twice because I'd grab it and I had no idea what I was doing, but I was determined  I had to learn and I had to learn in a hurry. So I guess Roger McDonough, who was then the State librarian, must have liked that attitude, because he came to me and said, "We're starting a reference referral service," and he explained what it would be. "Would you like to head it up?" and I said, "Absolutely." It was a service offered when local libraries couldn't answer the reference question. They would call me as reference referral. I would guarantee to answer their question in twenty-four hours or get back to them and tell them what I was doing. So it was a great opportunity. I would either fall on my face and everybody would say, "He's no good," or people would learn about me right away because they would be calling me from all over New Jersey. And that's how I heard about an opening here in Monmouth County. The director was going to retire and her reference librarian suggested she call me and see if I would come down for an interview, which I did, and I got the job. That's how I wound up here in Monmouth County. In those days, the county library was much different than it is today.    Ms. Newman: What year was that?    Mr. Livingstone: That was 1968. I came here in July. The Eastern Branch was just being completed in Shrewsbury. In fact, it opened in October. The Eastern Branch was the first real public library building in this county that was up to date. We had some real old buildings but nothing of recent vintage had been built. So it was a show place. The headquarters of the county library was in Freehold, the county seat. That's where most county libraries are located. We were in a big old house. We had hundreds of thousands of books packed into these rooms, it was amazing how many books they got into that place. Then we had a garage across town where we kept another collection of books because we had a department there that loaned the books to what we call member libraries. These are libraries in the county that pay tax support for the county system. So we would send them any book they requested plus hundreds of books that they could keep on their shelves for months and months, and then we'd go back and change the collection when they wanted to - that kind of thing.    Ms. Newman: Did you serve the public as well?      Library Quarters  80 Broad Street, Freehold 1940-1971  Mr. Livingstone: Oh, yes, we served the public out of this big old house. As I say, this was at the time Eastern Branch was being built. For example the children's library was just a collection of books in the garage, and in the wintertime that garage was cold, let me tell you. We had a space heater in there, but no kid would ever spend much time in there, I can tell you that. And there was no place to sit, because it was a garage with books in it. We had two bookmobiles, and they were ancient, and I still remember the first or second day on the job. We always had trouble starting those things in the winter, and that day one bookmobile wouldn't start, so sure enough my gas station experience came in handy, and next thing I knew, I was putting parts and that sort of thing in this bookmobile to get it going. We had two bookmobiles, we had headquarters, we had Eastern Branch, and then we started a branch system going. And now, of course, the library system has ten branches and we have a new headquarters library in Manalapan instead of in Freehold. I should mention before that we moved out of that Freehold house after several years to an empty building about two blocks away on Broad Street in Freehold, and this empty building had at one time been a Pathmark supermarket. Pathmark had gone out of there because they couldn't make it, and the town had made it into a teenage hangout called the Hullabaloo. Then, for whatever reason, the town stopped supporting it, the kids got mad and set the building on fire, and when we looked at it, it was a mess. The roof had huge holes burned in through it, it hadn't been occupied in quite a while, and the steel gutters were bent and whatnot, it looked awful, and there was water on the floor. But we had no choice  the Freeholders said, "You need more space, that's what we're giving you." So the county renovated it for us. It had a meat locker in the basement which we used to stack books. If you could have seen that place! We had wooden shelving down there, packed with about one hundred fifty thousand books. Couldn't be a worse place to keep books  it was always damp, and the lighting was poor. The building was eight thousand square feet, that's all  it was not big, but it did have a larger area than what we had been used to in the house two blocks away. It was still small, the staff were shoulder by shoulder,  so you got to know everybody pretty well.    Ms. Newman: How large a staff did you have?    Mr. Livingstone: I guess we had maybe thirty, thirty-five people, something like that in that building. We were under Civil Service. As you probably know, your choices are sometimes very limited as to who you can hire. They have to be on a list. If you're not happy with that list, that's just too bad  somehow or other you have to commit to those people who all want the job.  Many times you hire when no list is available. Then a list comes down from Trenton that you didn't know about. The person already in the job can be bounced by a person on the Civil Service list. I had to develop techniques to protect the  person already in the job. One of the techniques was to show these people the basement. They used to laugh in the Technical Services Department when I'd walk through the department and go down these stairs into the meat locker with these people. They'd laugh, shake their heads, and say, "Oh uh, there's somebody wants a job," and I'd go down there and show them all these books down there and this dank semi lit room, and I'd say, "You can see we've got a space problem here, this job requires shifting these books." And most everybody would say, "Oh, I'm not interested." And I'd say, "Fine. We'll keep you on the list, just sign here and say that you're not interested in this job." So that's the way that meat locker used to work to protect jobs. The infamous meat locker.    Ms. Newman: And were the kinds of requests you got very different from what you had been dealing with in Trenton, or was it rather the same? Or did you have different clientele?    Mr. Livingstone: We had different clientele. What I got in Trenton was usually a more sophisticated reference request, because  the local library had already worked on it.  Of course here it was different. We dealt with a variety of people who came into the libraries. Of course we had the usual crush of school assignments.    Ms. Newman: Well, the 1960s were obviously before computers.    Mr. Livingstone: In fact, they were tough days. The county wasn't doing a whole lot to fund us, and I used to have to go up to the Board of Freeholders and argue about raises for my staff, and the trouble in those days was that members of the Board of Freeholders knew most of the people in the county, and they knew a lot of people working for me. Some of those Freeholders had the idea, "Wow, this is so and so, and her husband's got a good business, so what does she need a better salary for?" It was that attitude: the woman doesn't need the money anyway, it's a second income type of thing. And many times, as you know, that's far from the truth. But even if it was the truth, it has nothing to do with doing the job. Budget time used to be a real interesting time. It became a problem to get a little increase in the budget for my staff, and ultimately that kind of attitude on the part of the Freeholders in those days lead to unionization. I'm convinced it led to unionization in the county  it certainly helped to stir our staff towards unionizing so that even to this day we have in the county system Civil Service and unions, so in a sense you've got an interesting management puzzle to solve all the time because you want people to do what you want done, you want the best people, but at the same time you're dealing with the union, and then you're also dealing with Civil Service, which is on top of that. When we moved, we maintained the garage on Marcy Street. People worked on the first floor or the second floor. The first floor was just a big warehouse type of thing, and in the summer it was blistering hot, because there was no air conditioning. I remember an incident with Sam Venti, who was one of my bookmobile drivers and also a maintenance man, and a real fine guy who could fix or build anything that you asked him to do. The county had been getting ready, prior to my coming there, to move a big collection of books over to the Eastern Branch before it opened in October. When I happened to go over in late July on a blistering hot day to check the packing and found hundreds of boxes with the books thrown in them in no order. It was a total mess.  So I called Sam Venti and said, "Sam, come over here, we've got to rig something together here, and you and I are going to spend the night putting these books in order." Which is exactly what we did. We packed them and marked each box, and we had every box properly marked and in order when we moved the whole collection over to the Eastern Branch. I would say aside from the opening of the Eastern Branch, one of the most important things that happened for us in the library was when I started the jazz series. We never had any kind of meeting room space, or anything like that until we had the Eastern Branch, but that meeting room is quite small, holding about eighty people.    Ms. Newman: What gave you the idea of the jazz series?    Mr. Livingstone: Well, I was always a jazz lover, but just a fan  I didn't know any musicians or anything like that. At that time there was a radio station in Long Branch that had a jazz show. Art Vincent was the MC of the show, "Art Vincent and the Art of jazz." He had a call in time, and I guess I must have called in and requested something, and one way or another he and I seemed to hit it off and I got to know Art Vincent. Art was an angle man, and he was always playing some kind of an angle, and he said to me that he had a musician acquaintance, Al Main, who was from Philly, as a matter of fact, who taught jazz guitar at Burlington County Community College. Al had some unusual musical theories that he wanted to present in concert format and he didn't know where to do it. And out of the blue I just said, "Why don't we use the library?"    Ms. Newman: What year was that?    Mr. Livingstone: This must have been in 1972 or 1973. The Eastern Branch wasn't open on Sundays, and I said, "Look, he can have it for nothing because the library's there, it's closed, it won't cost me anything to open the doors, I'll be there, I'll come over there, so we won't have any staff to worry about, but he'll have to provide the musicians, because I don't have any budget. If he can provide the musicians, I'll get a stage from somewhere, and we'll use the big reading room of the library as a concert hall." And so I met Al, and he said, "Yeah, great, I'd love to do that. Don't worry about the musicians, Jack, I've got plenty of musicians, they're all good, I'll come with an eight or ten piece band. It's a great opportunity for me, I want to present a few of my musical theories." Well, I'd never done this type of thing before, but I knew enough to know that I didn't want him to be too cerebral in his presentation. I said, "Al, don't forget it's a public library, it's not like Burlington County Community College, if these people learn something, that's great, but they're primarily going to come to be entertained. So don't preach too much about the musical theories because people won't care." And that's how we got started. My two oldest boys were in high school at the time, and the three of us went over to the library the night before, took books off shelves, picked up the shelves, moved them over to the perimeter of the room, and opened up the whole room. I got Mr. Parriot from the music department of the Asbury Park High School -- he's still playing the saxophone -- to lend me the risers from Asbury Park High School, so we had a stage, and then we set up chairs like an auditorium. Well, we packed the place! And I didn't have anybody there that anybody had ever heard of. The unfortunate thing was Al Main didn't take seriously my admonition not to talk too much about his musical theories and he brought a blackboard and he went on and on and on and the next thing I knew people were walking out. So I was at my wit's end. I passed up notes, "Start to play, start to play." To top it off, the trumpet player was coming  from Philadelphia, and he got lost, so we were delayed in starting the concert. At any rate, we had a terrible program, but it had been a great idea. So the question was, "What can we do from here?" I didn't know. Al Main did a couple more of these things, none of which was as successful as the first one, as far as getting people in. None of them were that great. One day my wife Marlene and I were in a watering hole in Spring Lake and Kenny Davern, one of the finest jazz clarinetists in the country was playing there. He lives in Manasquan. I went up to him and introduced myself, and I told him what I had done, and I said, "I'd love to do another jazz concert, but I don't know what to do." He said, "I'll bring a quartet over to the library and play." I said, "Well, Kenny, I can't get you very much money." "How much can you get?" I said, "Maybe a couple hundred dollars." "I'll do it," he said. He named some musicians he would bring, and they were musicians whose records I have been buying for years  I couldn't believe it. So he came with a quartet, again we jammed the library, and it was a fantastic afternoon. I had found the key. I knew right away I had to do something else besides jazz, because a lot of people have this feeling that jazz is rock type music and you're going to have problems and that sort of thing. They don't understand that it's not that at all. I've had occasions when one of the Freeholders came to one program because she was told we had to be careful of all these people who were coming to these jazz concerts. Well, she got there and she saw all these sedate middle age people sitting there clapping. That's all they were doing. They were too old to do any harm, even if they wanted to. So from then on she was a great fan. Then we started a classical concert series, and one Sunday a month we had a classical concert. Morey Berger, my Assistant Director, booked those. I booked the jazz concerts, and we had one concert a month on a Sunday afternoon. Then we started an author series. We had one of those a month. And then we would have ethnic programs, and we had one of those a month. So we started all these programs, and we had that library humming every Sunday afternoon. It took a lot of time, but we did this for many years. We started in 1973 and kept it up year after year after year, never missing a Sunday. People would say to me, "Oh you love jazz, that's why you're doing it." Well, believe me Rhoda, I love jazz, but my family would have been happy to see me on a Sunday. I was never home on a Sunday, I was always working, every Sunday I did this for, I guess, twenty years, worked every Sunday. Then foolishly, I expanded it even more. My son, Steve, was interested in old movies, and we became a state designated regional film center, which is the state designated regional film center. So we had a lot of these old sixteen millimeter movies at the library. And Steve loved those things, so he would borrow a projector and show them at home because he wanted to see the old movies. We were talking one night, and I said, "Well, Steve, why don't we start a movie series at the library?" He was in high school, but he knew a lot about movies. "You can introduce these movies, Steve," I said. "You know more about them then I do. And we'll put together this series, we'll pick out the movies, and let's see who comes." So we started what we called "Friday Night Flicks." So every Friday night Steve and I were at the Eastern Branch showing old movies. This was a great experience for him, because he'd get up in front of the group and talk about the movie, or the actors in the movie, or the producer or the director, and that sort of thing, and people really enjoyed it. Well, from that we developed a loyal following of forty to fifty people who for years attended Friday Night Flicks.Steve eventually abandoned me when he went off to college, but I kept it going. I had people who came there every Friday night for ten years. They got to know one another. We had such a good time because I would kid with them. We became a family. They knew more about the movies than I did. I used to do a little research before I came over on a Friday afternoon, and I quickly learned that they loved to learn any gossip, so any gossip I could find about one of the stars, or the director, I would relate. They would correct me if I was wrong, and I would kid them, saying "You have no right to correct me, I'm the instructor." We had a walk-in closet, and we knocked a hole in that closet and put the projector behind that hole and projected on the wall with a screen. We had to put it in a closet because these projectors made a lot of noise. So I learned something: if you're going to put on a program, you've got to do it in a professional like way. Just to put a projector in the middle of the room, with all the noise that thing makes, and then show a movie on a screen and not pay attention to how it's being projected, maybe it's too low for people in the back to see, won't work. Attention to all these little things makes a professional show. People will stop coming it it isn't done well. So we always kept two projectors, because that way I can go from one to the other very quickly and without a break, and I'd rewind the first projector after switching to number two. Most libraries had just one projector, and you'd have to wait while they take the reel off, and then maybe they'd wait while the switching was made. That's going to do it, not in this day and age. So there were those kinds of things that I learned. The other thing I learned, and I'm leading up to a point here, I learned to schmooze with the audience. It's one thing to put on a concert or a program, people come in, of course all of our programs were free, because that is the Public Library philosophy, come in, see the program, and leave. But I would walk up and down the aisles, I'd talk with the people, I'd kid with them, it was like they had come into my living room, they were my guests, that's always the way I felt about it. So it was more than just a jazz concert or a classical concert, it was an experience of a friendly welcoming place to be. So my argument for libraries was always this: everybody has sort of a warm feeling about libraries, nobody really is against libraries, but there's no real what I call "Little League Enthusiasm" about libraries, or very limited anyway, and what programming brought to Monmouth County was "Little League Enthusiasm." The Board of Freeholders couldn't care less what my book collection looked like, they had no interest in that, and I knew that. They're interested in votes. And I can understand that if I was a Freeholder I'd be interested in that, too. So when I invited them to come to the Eastern Branch on a Sunday, and they showed up, of course I put them right up on the platform, told the audience what great people they were, how they funded these programs that we had here, and they saw five hundred happy people in front of them. Nobody was asking them any tough questions, they were always happy. Now what could be better publicity for the library? I'd introduce Ted Narozanick, who was very loyal to the library, and it got to be a kidding thing, "The Great Ted Narozanick, he's done this for the library - ", and he'd come up and say, "Jack Livingstone is the finest library director in the United States." It was all baloney, but I'd say to Morey, "That's a million bucks in our budget next year, what happened right there." And I actually saw people come up--I saw this happen on more than one occasion--people came up to Ted Narozanick and said, "Mr. Narozanick I'm voting for you, my whole family is voting for you because Jack told us to." Just like that! Now how could he ever say no to me?! He couldn't, and he wouldn't. We're still great friends to this day. So I was pushing the library in that way. That's the way I felt most comfortable pushing the library. So programming became a budget item and I used to refer to it as the engine that drives everything else in this library. I could get a great book budget, I could get more staff, I could get all kinds of things simply because those programs made the library very visible to the Board of Freeholders. Also, to the county administrator, the county treasurer, and people like that. So I could really get almost anything I asked for after a while. But it didn't happen overnight. It was many, many years of being there every Sunday, every Friday, for these programs. It's not an easy thing to do, but it can be effective if you're willing to do it. I always laugh at people who do a program and it's successful and they sit back and relax and they're very pleased, and I say, "Well, are you ready to do it again next Sunday, and then the Sunday after that, and will you still be doing it every Sunday five years from now? Then you have a reason to feel pretty happy about what's going on, if you can do that." Then Morey Berger came up with the American History series, and I loved that series because I love American History. He used to get great authors to come in, such as Stephen Ambrose, who just wrote the best selling book on World War II. He also wrote the biography of President Eisenhower. We had one after the other: Richard Current, who was a famous biographer of Abraham Lincoln, who finished the G. Randall  biography of Lincoln after Randall died. We had people like Donald Goldstein, who finished Gordon Prange's book, At Dawn We Slept, about Pearl Harbor. We had Joyce Carol Oates and Isaac Asimov and David Eisenhower - people of that caliber.    Ms. Newman: And you had good turnout for these?    Mr. Livingstone: The biggest turnout came, and still does, to the jazz programs. I was never happy with the turnout for author programs, but we would get thirty to one hundred people, depending on what the subject was and who was speaking. David Eisenhower brought a big audience out. So we had all of these great programs, and it was very interesting to see the people who would come. Generally they were older. World War II was, and still is a hot topic with my generation. We had one evening program on World War II when a retired Episcopal priest who wrote about the US Navy in the Pacific talked critically about Admiral "Bull" Halsey, and after he was done, somebody got up on the far side of the room and said, "Sir, I want to compliment you for telling the truth about that no good drunken bum, Halsey." And somebody on the near side of the room got up and said, "I take issue with that statement, sir." And I thought for a minute that we were going to have World War II all over again, and then I realized they were too old to do any damage anyway. We had those kinds of things happen. In the meantime, we were building the branch system. We added branches in Ocean Township, we added branches in Wall Township, Marlboro Township, Holmdel, Allentown, and Hazlet.    Ms. Newman: Why does the county also have several Township libraries that are not affiliated with the Monmouth County Library System?    Mr. Livingstone: We had about fifteen towns that had their own independent libraries, but they still chose to support, by tax money, County Library system. Funding for county libraries is a very strange animal. For example, residents of towns that do no offer tax support to the County Library system can use the facilities of the county system, but if they want to borrow something, they have to buy a library card. A lot of people get upset by that, not completely understanding why this should be, but the law is written in such a way that a town can always remain out of a county system if they're not happy with the cost and with the services. So you walk a very fine line in trying to provide a different level of service to those towns because some support you, and some don't support you.    Ms. Newman: How did you decide which towns to set up the branches in? Was that by popular demand?    Mr. Livingstone: It was by a lot of different things, generally it was by economic necessity. The old story. For example, right after I got here, the Mayor of Holmdel would bad mouth the county library system constantly. Holmdel had a little library that was independent, but they paid taxes to support us, and the person there hated the county. He called me one day and said, "We're thinking of pulling out of the county system, I just thought I'd let you know." I said, "Well, look, could I meet with you and talk this over?" And he said, "Sure." He was David Cohen, a real fine man. And right away I worked out a branch proposal. I knew I wouldn't keep them in the county system any other way, so I sat down with him. I said, "Look, we'll make you a branch, we'll put in a professional here, you don't have one here now, we'll bring in a children's program, you don't have a children's librarian now, we'll provide you with more books than you have now, we'll provide a book budget to help you save money." And so he went for it, and he took a lot of criticism from people who felt that we were driving out the person who was the township resident, that sort of thing, but it worked out very well. They then built a library in the municipal center, and they're still a branch, and they're still very pleased with it. That was many years ago. So it was that kind of thing. You had to balance off needs of the library with service, and you can't give any service if you're not in business, that was my feeling, so some of the branches came about because of that type of thing.    Ms. Newman: You remained as County Librarian until when?    Mr. Livingstone: I retired from the county library in1991.    Ms. Newman: Computers?    Mr. Livingstone: Oh, computers, yes. Oh that was interesting. Actually, when I first came here back in 1968, all the librarians were locked in a room upstairs in that big old house I described, underlining with crayon, color pencil, whatever, different parts of each library card, each catalog card, the main card, subject -    Ms. Newman: Were they done manually at that time?    Mr. Livingstone: Yes. At that time, we did everything manually. So we wanted to have a book catalog that could be computerized, and we used IBM cards, these big IBM cards. The county had purchased a computer, and it filled up a whole room in the county offices, and they needed justification for buying that computer, so one of the ways they justified the expenditure was that the county library would be using it for printing up book catalogs.    Ms. Newman: This was around 1970, would you say?    Mr. Livingstone: I came here in 1968, and we were starting to get ready for this. So we were way ahead of the curve on things, and it was a mess! We had a period of time at the Eastern Branch when we literally had no catalog  it was like a gigantic book mobile. You had to use Books In Print to find anything, you can imagine, that was not an easy life for those people there. I used to work every Tuesday night on the reference desk, simply to keep my hand in and to understand what was happening, and I used to learn a lot more in those few hours of Tuesday nights working there then just walking around and looking. But this working without a catalog, or with a book catalog, was really difficult, because what happened with the book catalog, of course, was you constantly have to print supplements to keep it up to date. So people would be looking in three, four, five places if they wanted to find out what we had. The computer, of course, was very slow. The County was going to do it all. Well, it turns out the County had no idea what to do. For example, the first book catalog we got from the county was not in alphabetical order. They couldn't figure out how to put it in alphabetical order. What we learned, we learned the hard way. We didn't know enough to ask the right questions. We found that with this computer, punctuation would come in between certain letters of the alphabet. So if you had a period in the card, it might come between M and N. So that would throw the whole alphabet off. It was really a mess. On the recommendation of one of my commissioners, we hired someone, Bob Maier, a young man who was very sharp, and he straightened us all out. It took a lot of work on his part. He got permission to get a key, and he'd come into the county offices in Freehold and literally spend the entire Saturday night running these cards off the IBM machine because the county had other things like voter registration lists and so forth that had top priority. We were bottom priority, naturally. So everything we did was always late. So he would do this for us. He used to tell me about the American Hotel facilities, which is where he would stay. It was a pretty primitive hotel. He'd sleep on the computer sometimes while it was grinding away, pumping these cards out, little by little, all night long. That's how we got started, we had the book catalog for years and years, then Bob Maier put together an automated catalog for us before anybody else had any of these newer more sophisticated systems.   They are just now replacing it - it should have been replaced sooner - and the new system  will do a lot of things that this system can't do. That was the introduction to computers for us.    Ms. Newman: Did the staff adapt to it?    Mr. Livingstone: They hated it. Everybody on the staff hated the book catalog and I couldn't blame them, I did too. And yet we had no answer, we were married to this darn thing. The catalog cards were gone, and nobody was keeping that up to date anyway, so everything was going into this book catalog which we had for years. It was awful. It was a tough period  somehow we weathered it and kept going. And of course, now with computerization so modern and the way everything's changed, all that's just a bad memory at this point.    Ms. Newman: And the public got used to the book catalog?    Mr. Livingstone: Nobody ever liked it, I think, but they were forced to like it, unfortunately. But this system just kept growing by leaps and bounds. The use that we would get, and now even more, was just unbelievable. And, of course, when we built the headquarters in 1986, much of the push for that building was because of the people who came to our programs. They complained they didn't want to drive a half hour from the Western part of the county for these programs, we needed a library out there in the Western part of the county. So that became the cry, and with the help of the Friends organization that we had, who worked with me, hand in glove, and my Library Commission, we got the then Mayor of Manalapan, who was smart enough to know that Townships have no center to support us. He said, "I want Manalapan Township to have something special that will separate it from other Townships." And he knew that we were talking about moving out of Freehold. "I'll give you eighteen acres of land in Manalapan if you'll build a library within two years." The Freeholders were smart enough to grab that offer.  The new building was eighty five thousand square feet. At the time we built it, it was the largest public library in the state. It had a separate area for programs and concerts and meetings and that sort of thing, which the public insisted on. You had to have it. So now they've expanded it. They just added thirty two thousand square feet last year, so it's an immense place, packed with people all the time. I should also mention, going back a little bit, in Freehold, when we were still in the supermarket, the roof always leaked. It was a flat roof, it never stopped leaking. And when I say leaked, I mean BAD leaks. And I can still remember waking up New Year's Day, many years ago, and it was pouring rain. My family lived in Ocean Township and I said to myself, "I'd better go out to Freehold just to see if everything is alright out there." So I drove out to Freehold and I opened up the door and I could hear rushing water as I opened the door. The whole library was under five inches of water. It was pouring through the ceiling as though there was no ceiling. I went to the basement and got all these plastic tarps, threw them over the bookshelves, but we lost hundreds and hundreds of books. I called our Buildings and Grounds Department and said, "You better get over here right away 'cause I'm going to be drowned if I don't get this thing fixed right now." So they worked all day New Year's Day to stop those leaks. We threw out gallons and gallons of water all day long. It was awful.    Ms. Newman: Were you able to preserve any of these things?    Mr. Livingstone: No, we threw dozens and dozens and dozens of books out. It would have cost us too much money to try to preserve them. We tried to save them. Some we could, but many others you just couldn't do anything with. And then also for years, a number of years, while we were waiting for the new library in Manalapan, we'd run out of space. So we still owned the house, and we used the house as a backup resource where we packed books away that, to all intents and purposes, were unusable because nobody could get there. None of the public could get there. So we had to live with those kinds of situations at times until this library was built, and then it changed everything, of course.    Ms. Newman: A dream come true.      John Livingstone pushing bookshelves into place before the grand opening of the headquarters, 1987  Mr. Livingstone: Yes, but it was also a very difficult transition. We had been living cheek by jowl, in eight thousand square feet on one floor, and people could turn to their neighbor and say, "I'm behind on doing this, if you're not busy at the moment, would you help?" Or you would say, "I can see you need some help, I'll help you out." Now people were on maybe different floors over 85,000 square feet. All those little things you took for granted, you couldn't take for granted anymore. Now we had a communication problem to deal with that we had never had before. So with all the complaining about the old place, it had certain advantages that we had to make adjustments to when we moved into this new place. But move we did.    Ms. Newman: It sounds very adventurous. And you had good clients.    Mr. Livingstone: When we opened the Library, it was like we were giving out World Series tickets. As a matter of fact, it was in January, and we had a blizzard that day  we even closed the library in the afternoon, the snow was so bad. But people were pouring through the doors in the morning as soon as we opened. It was a great opening, and it's been that way ever since. The circulation now I think is hitting a million a year in just that one building, which for us was unthinkable years ago, anything of that sort. So for us that was a lot of use. It's been a bargain for the County from the very first. It's been a great thing for the County.    Ms. Newman: You retired in 1990 after twenty-four years. Did you just feel that it was time?    Mr. Livingstone: Yes, I just thought it was time. I was sixty-five and I'd been doing this now for a long time, and the new building was built - I didn't see any real challenges there. I could run the darn thing with my eyes closed, and I didn't want to do it that way. It was time for somebody with new visions, new enthusiasms, to come in instead of me doing the same thing over and over again. So I just thought, "I'll retire." And I did.      John Livingstone (center) with county Freeholder Theodore Narozanick and chairwoman of Monmouth County Library Commission, Renee Swartz, 1989  Ms. Newman: But you didn't stay retired for long.    Mr. Livingstone: Well, I intended to. I didn't intend to go back to work. I stayed retired for three years and started doing some other things. I started swimming and that kind of thing. I started teaching an evening program. I taught the History of Jazz at Brookdale, and I did a seminar on The Duke Ellington Orchestra, and the History of Jazz here in Ocean Grove, and things like that. And then I got a call from Renee Swartz, who was the Chairperson of my commission while I was at the County Library and also the Chair of the Advisory Council to the State Library. She said that the state librarian was being asked to leave, and would I apply for the job on an interim basis. I said, "Are you kidding? I'm not interested in the State Library job. I don't really want that job." But she kept after me for a couple of weeks, and then the Deputy Commissioner of Education, who I didn't know, called me and said, "Come for an interview, even if you're not interested, just come for an interview." And even though I wasn't interested, I got the job. I said I didn't want to drive to Trenton, so he said how about three days a week. And I said, "Okay, that's not as bad." But I knew when I said it that you can't do this job three days a week. So I took the job, and of course I was working five days a week right away. And strangely enough, I liked it. I really did  in fact it's the best job I've ever had. But I'm at the stage again, where it's time. I've just completed another phase, and it's time for some new ideas, a new person, a young person -    Ms. Newman: How does the state library differ from the county library?    Mr. Livingstone: They are very different. There are plusses and minuses in each, but they are much different. The State Library, first of all, is special  it's like the Library of Congress, where you worked. It's a special library with a special collection geared for state employees, the legislature, and so forth. Genealogy is one of our features, and that kind of thing. So the library itself is one thing. And then we also operate the Library for the Blind and the Handicapped across town from the State Library which is on State Street, just adjacent to the museum and half a block from the state house. Then also we devise grant programs for public libraries. We exert some leadership in developing new concepts to help public libraries, and that's how we got involved with technology and started to get a state plan to make sure that every public library in the state, no matter how small, no matter how poor the town, has hardware PCs, up to date Pentium computers, the knowledge and the training to understand how they work and how to show people how to use them. And then has free access to the Internet - rapid, good, dependable access to the Internet. And that's what we've put together with the State now. We've got ninety percent of the libraries hooked up now.    Ms. Newman: And that's all done with state funds.    Mr. Livingstone: That's been done with a variety of things  it's been done with state money, it was done with a grant that we were able to get, a bond issue that we were able to get for five million dollars for technology for public libraries, and it was done with the help of Bell Atlantic, who provided the routers and the modems for all the public libraries that needed them in the state, plus the fifteen hub libraries. We've set up hubs as centerpieces to provide the access to the Internet. The routers required to do that cost about eighty thousand dollars a piece. Bell Atlantic installed those free of charge in all fifteen hubs. So they were a big part of this. It was a cooperative thing, in that sense. And we also built on the resources of the local community, too, because the state is never going to have the money to do all this by itself. So that was our concept - sharing resources, sharing the funding, and making sure that we had equity, that we had as much as possible equality in all the libraries of the state for this aspect of library service.    Ms. Newman: And this aspect of sharing, that's true with books as well, isn't it? Interlibrary loans, for instance.    Mr. Livingstone: Yes, exactly, and now we're putting into place the electronic library loan system where we have what we call "Virtual Statewide Database." This means that through the software of the system, a library staff member can sit at a computer and search many collections in libraries around the state to find a book in an instantaneous searching of five to eight libraries at a crack to locate the book that they need for a patron in their library.    Ms. Newman: And with all of this changing, you must have had a large training budget as well.    Mr. Livingstone: We never had a large budget for anything, to tell you the truth.    Ms. Newman: But you needed one.    Mr. Livingstone: We could use one, yes. We are lobbying for money now, of course, we always have been. But, strangely enough, I've been of the theory, and I would never say this to anybody in politics, but it's sometimes better not to overwhelm us with money, because we waste it. Not deliberately, but simply because with the government, if you don't spend it, you're going to lose it. It's just the way the system operates. Sometimes we don't know enough, and as you know, in technology, a lot of people are still learning, because it changes so quickly. If you don't know enough to have a real sensible operation planned, sometimes it's better to be able to start a little slower and try some things out, maybe on a smaller scale that is more manageable, make sure that you're satisfied with that direction, and then go from there. While we certainly needed money, and Bell Atlantic made a big difference, we've never been looking for millions and millions and millions of dollars the way the school systems are. They have money coming in through their ears, and they don't know what to do with their technology, and you'll see a lot of schools around the state that aren't using it very wisely because they just don't know yet how to use it. But they have to use it, so it's an expensive way of doing things.    Ms. Newman: But the library system has been effective.    Mr. Livingstone: Been very effective. I think we are one of the first, and we still might be the only one, I don't know, that has built a technological infrastructure across the state to see that public libraries have access to the Internet and have command of materials that are worth viewing, such as full text periodicals. Through this periodical service, people are able to get the latest information from over twelve hundred journals from their computer, both in the library and at home through this system  this is at no cost to the public. We are working with state government money and in a statewide fashion to get a very effective use of that expenditure in funds. Bell Atlantic tells us we're saving public libraries a million dollars a year in technology Internet access by the system that has been put together. Their engineers helped design the system to insure that we have an effective way of doing this. So we feel very confident that we've got a system that can meet today's needs, and if we have to go in a different direction tomorrow, since nobody can predict what will happen, we will be able to do it. What we've done in these past few years will have been effective and will have been worth it to the public. So we're in that stage right now where we're able to begin to think about some new initiatives, but I'm not sure what they'll be. And that may be why it's a good time for somebody else to come in - someone who knows more about technology. I know nothing about technology, I've learned just enough to be dangerous.    Ms. Newman: But you have the user's viewpoint, don't you?      Mr. Livingstone receiving the New Jersey Library Association's 1989 Library Service Award  Mr. Livingstone: I have the user's viewpoint to a degree, and I learned you don't have to be an expert in technology to put something together and get it going, to get people working on it. Let the experts handle the nuts and bolts and work those things out, which is the way we've handled it here, and it seems to have paid off.    Ms. Newman: And as for yourself, what new directions are you looking for?    Mr. Livingstone: I'm not a very good planner, and dont look forward too far.    Ms. Newman: You've come a long way from that first catalog course, haven't you?    Mr. Livingstone: Oh, yes. A lot has happened since those days, sure. A long way from the days when I was in the service station and working for Atlantic Refining.    Ms. Newman: And as far as Ocean Grove, you came here as a child and then -    Mr. Livingstone: Then I moved back here after my wife passed away. I moved back here and Ocean Grove was kind of mixed at that time. The situation was such that many people told me, "You're crazy to go to Ocean Grove: there is a halfway house situation and all of that." It is certainly different. The hotels were no longer able to operate as hotels, and some of them were halfway houses, and that sort of thing. But I happened to find this place, and I liked it and took a chance, that's all. And I'm glad I did, because Ocean Grove is obviously coming back. I think we're on the right path.    Ms. Newman: Well, thank you very much  it's been an interesting interview.     
MonmouthCounty;Joan Hague;1932;2000;Joan Hague, 1932, 2000        Remembering The 20th Century: An Oral History of Monmouth County    Date of Interview: August 10, 2000  Name of Interviewer: Douglas Aumack  Premises of Interview: Ms. Hague's home, Freehold, NJ  Birthdate of Subject: March 6, 1932    Mr. Aumack: It is a pleasure to be with you. Let's start from the beginning: when did you come to Monmouth County and why?    Ms. Hague: My husband loved Monmouth County. I met him when he was stationed at Fort Monmouth, and everything was just green. It was all farms, and very few homes that were seeable from the highway. There were no stores whatsoever, and no billboards. It was just a beautiful place to live. My husband had never been to the ocean until he met me, and that became his second love. He just loved the ocean. I didn't have four kids to watch in the ocean, I had five kids to watch. So of course Mom never got in the water, because she was watching all five of them in the water. (laughter) But it was enjoyable growing up. Long Beach Island is in Ocean County, but we spent as much time down there as we could. My parents owned a home down there, and we spent a lot of time in the summers down there.    Mr. Aumack: Now you moved to Middletown when you first moved here?    Ms. Hague: Yes, in 1954.    Mr. Aumack: What highway, if any, was there?    Ms. Hague: Route 35.    Mr. Aumack: And that was it?    Ms. Hague: Yes, there was no Parkway.    Mr. Aumack: No Garden State Parkway.    Ms. Hague: No Garden State Parkway.    Mr. Aumack: And no Turnpike. Was there a Turnpike, do you know?    Ms. Hague: I don't remember if the Turnpike was built back then. It may have been.    Mr. Aumack: Did Route 35 have a lot of traffic?    Ms. Hague: Yes, more or less like the Parkway, but not the volume they have now. But there was quite a bit. I remember in the hurricane of 1937 that hit New York also hit New Jersey along the coast.    Mr. Aumack: Did it hit you in Middletown?    Ms. Hague: We were on Long Beach Island. We got off the island just before the tidal wave hit.    Mr. Aumack: Whew!    Ms. Hague: And there were two cars. My mom and dad and my twin and myself were in one car, and my aunt, cousin, and my older sister were in the other car. And we drove up Route 9, weaving in and out of farms because of trees and wires down. We got stuck in Freehold, and transformers were blowing up. A nice couple came down from an apartment next to where we were parked and invited us up for the night.    Mr. Aumack: Oh wow!    Ms. Hague: So I think we slept on the floor, but I don't remember that part of it. But the rest of it I remember vividly. The sky was yellow before the storm hit, and the ocean was like a lake. The sand, as we were going off, was coming down as hard as the water. The causeway was under water, so we barely made it off in time. We could have been caught down there. But the house we were staying in survived it. The house we stayed in on Long Beach Island was in Ship Bottom, and that house survived and was not swept away. The owners stayed down there and saw the tidal wave go over their home. And they survived. That's why I would never own a home on the ocean. I think if I could afford it, I'd spend the summers down there now. But I would never own a home there.    Mr. Aumack: Because of what you witnessed.    Ms. Hague: Yes, and there was also a bad storm in 1962, a Northeaster. That was right after my mother and father died. I could sit on the front stoop a block and a half away from the ocean, and I could see the ocean. It was just flat all the way to the ocean.    Mr. Aumack: What town did you growing up in?    Ms. Hague: I grew up in Cranford, New Jersey, which is in Union County.    Mr. Aumack: Do you remember the name of this hurricane that you were telling me about?    Ms. Hague: No. It's probably in the newspapers, because they have talked about it on television.    Mr. Aumack: How did you hear about it? Were you on the beach and then saw it coming?    Ms. Hague: We knew there was a bad storm or hurricane coming, so we opened the trunks of both cars and literally threw everything in. We didn't pack suitcases, we just threw everything right into the trunks and got off as fast as we could.    Mr. Aumack: Did you think that you were going to lose your home?    Ms. Hague: Well, that was not a home we owned at the time. My parents didn't buy one until many years later. This was a rental. It was scary!    Mr. Aumack: What about the Northeaster in 1962? Where were you?    Ms. Hague: We were not on the island at the time.    Mr. Aumack: Were you in Monmouth County in 1962?    Ms. Hague: Yes, in Middletown. My parents owned a home on Long Beach Island. My uncle's mother owned two homes, and they were both destroyed. The stoop was left of one, and the chimney was left of the other. The island was cut in three sections. That was devastating! I have a lot of pictures of it.    Mr. Aumack: Now you came here in 1954.    Ms. Hague: December 17th, to be exact.    Mr. Aumack: How old were you when you moved down here?    Ms. Hague: I got married when I was twenty, so I was twenty-two years old.    Mr. Aumack: Now you suggested to your husband that you move down here? Or did he want to move down here?    Ms. Hague: He wanted to move down here, which was fine.    Mr. Aumack: Where did you move to, do you remember the address?    Ms. Hague: Yes, 29 Handyboy Court. That's where that picture is from.    Mr. Aumack: Oh wow. How long did you live there?    Ms. Hague: From 1954 to 1983.    Mr. Aumack: At the time, what was your husband doing? What was his job in 1954?    Ms. Hague: He was an x-ray technician, and then x-ray manager for General Electric. He worked for them for twenty-five years in medical x-ray and then industrial x-ray. He was an expert in the field on some equipment. In fact, I would get calls up to two or three years after he died asking for him.    Mr. Aumack: Now was he one of the pioneers of x-rays?    Ms. Hague: No. General Electric isn't in that field anymore. They sold that part of the company.    Mr. Aumack: Tell me about your husband's work on the first hydrogen bomb test.    Ms. Hague: I don't know too much about it, because he never talked about it. All I know is it was a rock in the middle of the Pacific, and that's where he worked. That's really as far as I know. He did not go into any detail at all.    Mr. Aumack: Do you know how long he was working on it?    Ms. Hague: Probably about one and a half years, until he was injured. Then he was sent to a hospital in Hawaii, in Honolulu. He was there for eight or nine months.    Mr. Aumack: How did he become injured?    Ms. Hague: Unloading a ship. A cable snapped, and he got a crate on his back.    Mr. Aumack: I thought maybe it would have something to do with radiation.    Ms. Hague: No, it had nothing to do with radiation.    Mr. Aumack: So it was a safe distance away?    Ms. Hague: He worked in microwave.    Mr. Aumack: Alright, we'll get back to that later on. So he worked from 1950 until about mid-1952 on the island where the H-bomb was set off.    Ms. Hague: No, that was before we were married.    Mr. Aumack: Do you know the year he worked on the first H-bomb?    Ms. Hague: I don't know if he actually worked on the H-bomb, just that he worked on the island. He got out of the hospital in Honolulu in the spring of 1952. So it was the two years previous to that, I guess, which was when he started. The island is no more. The island was destroyed during the test, which they expected. You would probably find it on an old map, but not the new maps.    Mr. Aumack: So this was the first hydrogen bomb test in the world?    Ms. Hague: As far as I know.    Mr. Aumack: Wow, that's big!    Ms. Hague: I guess he was like a lot of other servicemen, they just didn't want to talk about their experiences. And he was one of them. It didn't bother him not to talk about it.    Mr. Aumack: What did he do in the service?    Ms. Hague: He worked on microwave.    Mr. Aumack: Was that the Army?    Ms. Hague: Yes, the Army.    Mr. Aumack: What did he do with microwave?    Ms. Hague: I have no idea. I'm not much help in that category.    Mr. Aumack: That's fine. Tell us what movies you saw when you were younger.    Ms. Hague: I enjoyed the movies, but my husband hated going to the movies. When we were married, we very rarely ever went to a movie. I wanted to see the first James Bond movie. It came out the year he died. He died before the movie came out. No, it wasn't Star Wars. It was one of the James Bond movies, the first one that came out.    Mr. Aumack: Doctor No was the first movie.    Ms. Hague: I wanted to go see it, and he wouldn't go. He said to wait until next year and it would be on television. When it did come out on television, I told him that was the longest year I ever waited. Eleven years later it came out on television!    Mr. Aumack: Wow, was it worth it?    Ms. Hague: Yes, it was worth it. I have enjoyed every one.    Mr. Aumack: So have I.    Ms. Hague: Now I usually watch them on HBO.    Mr. Aumack: Why did he hate the movies?    Ms. Hague: Probably because he fell asleep when he went. I had a brother-in-law who used to do the same thing. He used to fall asleep at the movies, so he didn't enjoy going either. Some men just don't like it.    Mr. Aumack: When he was working on microwave, he was working at Fort Monmouth, correct?    Ms. Hague: He was working at Fort Monmouth, but he got a discharge when he left the hospital. It was a medical discharge.    Mr. Aumack: So then he worked for General Electric.    Ms. Hague: He worked for them since high school. The first five years we were married, he put himself through night school at Seton Hall.    Mr. Aumack: That's good!    Ms. Hague: He got his business degree and ended up being manager at the office in his field, the industrial x-ray and at first medical x-ray, when he worked in hospitals. Then he switched over to industrial x-ray. Many nights he'd go out at two o'clock in the morning and come home at four o'clock, reeking of beer because he'd be going to a factory that made beer and the line wasn't working. And of course that's all done by x-ray. All the cans are x-rayed. If the amount was under or over the limit in the can, the cans would automatically be kicked off the assembly line. And of course, then all of them would start to be kicked off. So he would have to go up and fix it, and he'd come home reeking of beer. And he hated beer! He wouldn't touch it. He very rarely drank anything.    Mr. Aumack: Tell me more about what he did with x-ray, to your memory.    Ms. Hague: Well he spent a good many years in medical x-ray, and then he switched over to the industrial. There was something out in Harrisburg, and he would go out there. He spent a lot of time there. He also spent time at the Whitman Chocolate Factory, which he always enjoyed because he would bring home five-pound boxes of discards. They tasted just as good, they just weren't formed like little candies.    Mr. Aumack: Oh wow, so you got the great chocolate.    Ms. Hague: Yes, we got the great chocolate. Of course this was many, many years ago. But he enjoyed his work. He was offered a promotion out to Milwaukee, which was one of the main branches at the time. And he turned it down. He would not take an office job. He said it would drive him up the wall to sit in an office from nine to five. He liked being out on the road.    Mr. Aumack: So he was like a field engineer, or something like that?    Ms. Hague: Yes.    Mr. Aumack: Ok. Why did he change from medical to industrial?    Ms. Hague: It was a step up. It was a nice promotion.    Mr. Aumack: Oh, that's nice. What did he do with industrial x-ray besides the assembly line work?    Ms. Hague: Any problems anybody had with their x-ray machines, he would go out and analyze it and find out what was wrong. And then he would fix it. When he was first diagnosed with heart problems, he had to go in for an x-ray. I think it is an echocardiogram, where they put the probe into the heart. And the x-ray went out. And they saw everything through the x-ray, where the probe was going in. And it broke down in the middle of the test. And he laid there and told them how to fix the x-ray. So they got it working again, and they were able to continue with the test. They could not believe it, the doctors there, that he could lie there and tell them exactly what was wrong and how to fix it.    Mr. Aumack: Was he in pain?    Ms. Hague: Not as far as I know. They did call him a walking time bomb. Then he had a quadruple by-pass. And he died eight months later. He was forty-seven years old.    Mr. Aumack: So he died in…    Ms. Hague: In 1976, St. Patrick's Day.    Mr. Aumack: When you were in Middletown in the 1950s, where did you shop for groceries, produce, and things like that?    Ms. Hague: When I was in Middletown, I shopped at A & P on Route 36. There were no supermarkets in Middletown yet. Once they built supermarkets, then I shopped in Middletown.    Mr. Aumack: Let's talk about when you heard about Pearl Harbor. You had discussed hearing about what happened on the radio.    Ms. Hague: I was nine years old, and I heard about it on the radio. I can remember it as clear as if it was yesterday, hearing that radio report that Pearl Harbor had been bombed. It shocked everybody. I also remember the Hindenberg very clearly. Also, one time I was talking on the phone to my husband in Milwaukee, and he asked what that loud noise was over the phone. And I said I didn't know, but it was a very bad explosion somewhere here. That was when one of the silos or something blew up at Earle Naval Station. I saw pieces of metal flying up in the air. And that was quite a bit away from where I lived off Route 35, and this was over at Earle in Atlantic Highlands.    Mr. Aumack: So how many miles was that?    Ms. Hague: It was several miles away.    Mr. Aumack: And you still saw metal flying?    Ms. Hague: Flying over hundred-year old trees, yes, straight up in the air. The whole house shook. I know there were some killed, but I don't know how many.    Mr. Aumack: Did you later hear why it exploded?    Ms. Hague: If I did, I don't recall why it exploded. I also remember feeling an earthquake in Middletown.    Mr. Aumack: Oh, tell us about that.    Ms. Hague: It was just like a loud bang! They said in the paper the next day that it was an earthquake. It shook the house, and it lasted only three or four seconds, if that. And it surprised me--an earthquake in New Jersey! But that's what they said it was.    Mr. Aumack: Let's go back to Pearl Harbor. The gentleman on the radio, what did he sound like?    Ms. Hague: Very, very serious. I don't know what newscaster was on. Also, when the Hindenberg went down, the announcer was crying. They still play the recording of the announcer, and he was crying. And that really hit hard to hear that. He saw it coming down and crashing, it was so emotional to him that he was in tears. One of my sons-in-law works at Lakehurst now with the MTSB.    Mr. Aumack: So he actually witnessed this.    Ms. Hague: Yes, he witnessed the whole thing. And I also remember the newscast of the Martians landing in southern Jersey, somewhere. (laughter)    Mr. Aumack: That radio program, The War of the Worlds. Did you hear that on the radio?    Ms. Hague: Yes, I heard part of it. I don't remember too much, but I do remember that it was all over the news and the newspapers. I thought it was an absolute riot!    Mr. Aumack: Did you believe that Martians were landing?    Ms. Hague: No.    Mr. Aumack: Because a lot of people did believe it.    Ms. Hague: I know a lot of people did.    Mr. Aumack: They got into their cars and packed up everything, like you did when you knew that a storm was coming. And they drove off! But you were cool?    Ms. Hague: I don't recollect. I don't even remember what year it was in, so I don't know how old I was.    Mr. Aumack: It sounds like you were entertained instead of fooled.    Ms. Hague: Yes, it was more entertainment than anything else.    Mr. Aumack: When you were in Middletown in the 1950s, what was hospital and medical care like? Where was the nearest hospital from Middletown?    Ms. Hague: Riverview Hospital.    Mr. Aumack: Was there any talk of faulty medical care, to your recollection?    Ms. Hague: I heard rumors about Bay Shore Hospital in the early 1970s or late 1960s. My daughter was in a car accident in 1974, and she was taken to Bay Shore. The care that she got there was beyond reproach. She had fourteen operations over three years and had excellent care. The nurses and doctors were great. And I lost my husband in those same three years.    Mr. Aumack: This was on her leg?    Ms. Hague: On her arm. She almost lost her arm. Surgeons wanted to take her arm off, and we said no. We called our neighbor, who was our doctor and close friend, and he told us who to get. In fact, I'm going to go see that doctor in the next couple of weeks. I have to have some tests done there.    Mr. Aumack: Do you think that Bay Shore is to blame for the arm problems of your daughter?    Ms. Hague: No, it if wasn't for them, she wouldn't have an arm. Dr. Kappy was a new doctor that was just starting practice, and they said he was phenomenal. And he certainly was! He was an orthopedic doctor. And then there was Dr. Norwitz, who was the plastic surgeon. And they did wonders for her.    Mr. Aumack: Good. When your husband had his quadruple by-pass, where was the operation done?    Ms. Hague: Mt. Sinai, New York City.    Mr. Aumack: Do you remember any other faulty medical work at Bay Shore? Any rumors?    Ms. Hague: I just heard a few rumors that it wasn't the best hospital to go to. And yet the nurses, the doctors, and everybody there was fantastic. I was there every day. It got to the point that if I went to the cafeteria, I would get my meals for half-price. They thought I worked there. And I didn't let them know any different. (laughter) At that point, I was just widowed. And any money I could save, I would. I would just go up to my daughter's room, hang my coat up, and then go back down and have breakfast. When she was in Intensive Care, I stayed with her all day. They didn't have enough help, so I would bathe and feed her. And they were very grateful for any help that I could give.    Mr. Aumack: You discussed an armored car robbery. Describe that as best you can.    Ms. Hague: The first I had heard of it was a phone call saying there had been a shooting and a robbery at the Two Guys Store. We were told to close and lock our doors, and to close and lock all our windows, because they were back in Applebrook. So we did that. And there was a policeman with a rifle and a dog on every corner. And they tracked them over to the next development, which is now behind Bradley's in Middletown. It was scary! People looked out their windows, and then they would call the police and say, "They just went through my yard." They told me, when they called me, to call as many neighbors as I could and let them know. So they had not called every person in the development. So I called all my neighbors and told them to lock up and stay away from the windows and doors.    Mr. Aumack: Now this was in Middletown?    Ms. Hague: Yes, in Middletown.    Mr. Aumack: Do you remember the amount of money that they took?    Ms. Hague: I have no idea. They also had someone who was breaking into homes. I don't remember exactly when that was, but they made one major mistake. He or they tried to break into the home of an FBI agent, who lived in our development. In fact he was a friend of ours. The robber couldn't get into his house, but because he tried, they got him. They got him in California, as a matter of fact.    Mr. Aumack: Do you know what gave the burglar away?    Ms. Hague: No, I don't. All I know is that he made the mistake of trying to break into this FBI agent's house. (Laughter) I don't know if they still live in Applebrook or not. I go back there occasionally. In fact my kids were in the house they grew up in. Last week they drove over there and knocked on the door, and the woman let them in. So they got to see the house.    Mr. Aumack: Before this crime, did you lock your doors or anything?    Ms. Hague: No. We lived on a dead-end street. It was just a cul-de-sac at the end of the street, and there was a meadow down at the end of the street. My brother-in-law died last November, and up until that time, my sister never locked a door, morning, noon, or night. Now she does because she is alone. But nowadays, I don't think it's safe for anyone to leave a door unlocked. I don't take the chance, and I'm alone. I don't lock my storm door at night, so if anything happens, my kids can get in the house. I don't have a key to the storm door. It was never given to me when I moved in.    Mr. Aumack: It's just incredible. Why do you think that people feel they have to lock their doors now?    Ms. Hague: There is a lot more crime now than there was back when I was growing up. I don't remember locking the door when I grew up or where I moved to when I got married.    Mr. Aumack: Now in your development, did everyone know everyone else?    Ms. Hague: Everybody knew everybody else for blocks around. My son had twenty-seven other boys in the development that he played with. So he never had a lack of playmates. My eldest daughter had a problem with playmates because we were new in the development, and we were the first house on the street. She had no playmates, so she was the only one that went to nursery school. And that was so she would have contact with other children. But the others, I never had to send them to nursery school because there were a lot of playmates around.    Mr. Aumack: It sounds like if there was a criminal who was local, it sounds like they could say, "Oh, he lives two houses down."    Ms. Hague: Well, it was unusual for someone to come into the development because there was only one way in and one way out by car. So a professional would not come into our development, so it had to be somebody local, possibly teenagers.    Mr. Aumack: Let's talk about the names of the horses for the streets. Talk about Applebrook.    Ms. Hague: It used to be a working farm, and they raised horses there. And they did actual farming there. Back before that, the Conover family raised horses. And all the streets are named after horses. The main street is Hamiltonian Drive. Then there's Attaboy, Gayboy, Handyboy, Orphanboy and Highboy Court. We lived on Handyboy Court, and they called my husband the Handy Man of Handyboy Court, because he could fix anything.    Mr. Aumack: So was he the neighborhood handyman, then?    Ms. Hague: Yes, if anybody had problems, they would call on John.    Mr. Aumack: I guess his weekends were a little filled sometimes.    Ms. Hague: Always. We could never use the garage because it was filled with x-ray equipment. He would take old x-ray equipment and bring it up to par, and then he would sell it. It was a way to earn extra money. He was a good man. I never dared open the garage door when he was working though, because the air sometimes would get kind of blue.    Mr. Aumack: Why would it get blue?    Ms. Hague: Swearing.    Mr. Aumack: Oh, I see.    Ms. Hague: He didn't smoke, and he would never swear in front of the kids or me. I never heard a swear word come out of him, except once when I opened the garage door. And I didn't do that again.    Mr. Aumack: Talk to us about Dearborn Farms.    Ms. Hague: It was a tragedy when they sold that. I spent a lot of time there, and it was a great place. I always bought all my fruits and vegetables there. Then they turned it into apartments or condos and then a strip mall, and it was huge. I mean it looks very nice from the highway, and they did a good aesthetic job when they built it. But I hated to see the farmland go. And that is the one thing that I don't like about Route 35. It used to be such a beautiful place. I liked it because it was so green and so open, but it's not that way any more. It's nothing but stores, shops, billboards, and restaurants.    Mr. Aumack: When you first came here, there wasn't Route 35, was there?    Ms. Hague: There was Route 35. The main street of Middletown was Kings Highway. That's where there were stores, four or five of them, but no more than that. And that was the center of Middletown.    Mr. Aumack: Tell us about Red Bank.    Ms. Hague: Red Bank used to be a very nice town, and then it kind of went downhill. Now it's getting to be a real nice town again. They have really built it up, and it looks very nice. I haven't been there in awhile, because with my back it's too much of a drive. But I get over there when I can. If I have a doctor's appointment, I go to my doctors over there. I didn't get new doctors when I moved here to Freehold. When you have had the same doctor for twenty years, you don't want to change. But Red Bank is nice, and I get to drive through it occasionally. And I like it.    Mr. Aumack: Why do you think it declined?    Ms. Hague: I guess people just seemed to lose interest in it, and it just went downhill. But now it's really getting nice again. It's a nice town.    Mr. Aumack: Let's go back to Wagon Wheel Farms. I just want to make sure on some facts. Is what used to be Wagon Wheel Farms that area across from the produce store known as Dearborn Farms?    Ms. Hague: Yes.    Mr. Aumack: Ok, alright.    Ms. Hague: And they have condos behind that. They are $200-400,000 condos. But they also have interspersed low-income housing through it. And I know someone who lives there, who used to live across the street from me. And those low-income houses are really beautiful. They are very small: it's just living room, kitchen, bedroom, and bathroom. But the architect did a beautiful job on it.    Mr. Aumack: Do you think the availability of low-income housing is a good price to pay for more people in the area?    Ms. Hague: Well, it depends on how big a place you want. Senior citizens with little income enjoy being able to stay in the area in affordable housing. Some of those condos are huge. I mean I lived in a condo for twelve years, and it was a very nice one.    Mr. Aumack: So Wagon Wheel Farms used to be hundreds of acres.    Ms. Hague: Oh, hundreds of acres, yes. There were apple orchards, peach orchards, and it was really nice. It was a nice place to bring your kids to, which I used to do quite often.    Mr. Aumack: Talk to me about your philosophy of raising your children in Middletown.    Ms. Hague: In a way, just let them go their own way. We told them they were always allowed their own opinions. We might not agree with it, but you are allowed your own opinion. And we'll give your opinion a lot of attention, too. But they grew up pretty happy. Things changed when my husband died, and my youngest was eleven and my oldest was twenty-one. But it was a very happy home life, and we never had any problems with the kids. Not like you see nowadays. I know my one daughter tried marijuana behind her girlfriend's garage, but I didn't like it, so she didn't try it again. But I know kids experiment. I can remember my son coming home drunk once. He walked in the front door, trying to be so nonchalant. He was walking across the floor to his bedroom, and we just sat there and laughed because it was so funny. I mean you knew he was drunk. And we never punished him. We figured he was going to get his own punishment when he woke up the next morning. And when we knew he was awake, we started slamming doors, banging cabinet doors closed, and we slammed the back door when we went outside. We figured we were really going to let him pay for it! And that was the last time he got drunk.    Mr. Aumack: How old was he when he got drunk, do you remember?    Ms. Hague: Probably around seventeen. He very rarely has any drinks, and I don't think he does drink anymore. Since his father died, he changed his whole lifestyle. He has inherited his father's heart problems, which is something that has been brought down on his father's side of the family. So he is on medication now.    Mr. Aumack: And how old is he now, may I ask?    Ms. Hague: He just turned forty-four on Sunday. I think he weighs now what he did in high school. So he keeps himself in very good shape, as all my kids do.    Mr. Aumack: When they were young, where did they play?    Ms. Hague: In the backyard, in the development. We had 200 feet between my house and my neighbor's house in back of me, and it was all open. So there was plenty of place to play. Our backyard became the home base for a lot of the kids, particularly the boys. I know one boy decided he was going to be Tarzan and swing from one tree to the other, and of course he ended up with a broken wrist from falling. And his mother told me I didn't have to pay the bills, although I had offered to. She said it was the same wrist he had broken the year before trying the same thing. She said he was just accident-prone.    Mr. Aumack: Well, if he didn't swing, maybe he wouldn't be so accident-prone.    Ms. Hague: He did swing, and that was the problem. And you can't watch them every second, you know. Every once in awhile I would go look and make sure they weren't doing anything they weren't supposed to do. And my son got in trouble a few times. One time he was showing his sister, who was fourteen months younger than him, how to break all the windows in the garage with a baseball bat. He was about three, and she was a little over two. And he thought that would be fun because she would get blamed for it because she actually did it. But oh no.    Mr. Aumack: How did you discipline them?    Ms. Hague: We didn't discipline Heidi, but Blake got disciplined. I don't remember how, but he got disciplined. And he said, "But I didn't do it." And we said, "Yes, we know you didn't do it, but you showed your sister how to do it. That makes a big difference." But they were pretty good. He was stubborn, but I never had any major problems with the kids.    Mr. Aumack: Do you think being home with them was essential to them growing up and making that type of family?    Ms. Hague: Yes, all four are very caring kids, which I wanted. I wanted kids that grew up with responsibility and caring, and they are all that way. And I think that's important.    Mr. Aumack: Do you think that it would have gone another way if you had a job during the day?    Ms. Hague: With the fourth one, I had to go to work. But I got a job from a neighbor in a store in Middletown. I worked from nine in the morning until two, and my daughter got out of school about ten minutes after two. So I was home before she was. She didn't want me to stay home on her account, and I told her I wasn't staying home, I was just getting home right before her. And she said she didn't need a babysitter, and I told her I wasn't doing it to be her babysitter. I was home for her sisters and brothers, and I wanted to be home for her. I told her that was something that I wanted to do. So that's what I did until she went off to college. The store was open at ten, and I was there at nine. It was at Cloth World, in Middletown.    Mr. Aumack: Describe your job at Cloth World.    Ms. Hague: I managed all the notions, the whole wall of notions.    Mr. Aumack: What is the wall of notions?    Ms. Hague: Threads, scissors, sewing machine parts, zippers, and everything that wasn't fabric.    Mr. Aumack: How long did you work there?    Ms. Hague: Until they fired the manager. They didn't make as much money as some of the other stores. They only made $800,000/year instead of one million, which was their goal. So because he didn't make their goal, they used him as an example and fired him. And he was fired by his best friend, and he said that was what really hurt the most. So of course the new people came in, and they changed everybody's schedule. And they knew I had to be out of work at two. And they changed my schedule from two to nine at night, and there was no way I could be there. So I had to quit my job. And it was awhile before I was able to get another one.    Mr. Aumack: Why do you think that was? Was it tough?    Ms. Hague: Tough getting a job? Yes. Of course I hadn't worked in so many years. I went to Berkley Business School, which wasn't the training for working in the notions department in Cloth World. But I had been out of work for so many years. The problem with getting a job was they don't want you unless you have experience, and no one will give you a job to get the experience. So it was like a three-ring circus. So it was very difficult getting into the work field. I finally got a temp job at the Board of Realtors, for two days. And then it ended up being twelve days, and then three months later, they called me back to work full-time. So I worked there for six and a half or seven years, which I enjoyed, because it was five minutes from my front door. It was great, and it worked out fine.    Mr. Aumack: Let's discuss the Middletown Library. Do you remember when that came about?    Ms. Hague: The Middletown Library. I don't remember the year, but they had a library on Kings Highway in a house. And it was the library. It was many years later when they built the one on New Monmouth Road. That still stands today. I spent a lot of time there, because I was an avid reader.    Mr. Aumack: What did you read?    Ms. Hague: At the time, I guess it was mainly mysteries and historical novels that I enjoyed the most. And I still do.    Mr. Aumack: Did you like the way it grew and expanded?    Ms. Hague: Oh yes, very much. I didn't get to the one in Shrewsbury very often, which was the main library. I really had no reason to go there. My kids went there when they were in school, for reference work when they couldn't find what they wanted in Middletown.    Mr. Aumack: So in the 1960s, the Monmouth County Library in Shrewsbury was the place for Middletown student to go for school work?    Ms. Hague: That was the main library in Monmouth County, I believe.    Mr. Aumack: Let's discuss Dr. Alice Tyndall.    Ms. Hague: She was a great lady. I don't know if she has quit her practice yet or not. As far as I know, she is still practicing. And I thought she was marvelous. She took very good care of my children. She had what a lot of doctors don't have, and she had call-in hours. You could call her between eight and nine in the morning, and you would always get to talk to her.  You could always call her then, and I quite frequently did call her if I had a problem or question, as I was a new mother. I would give her a call, and she was a very compassionate woman. When my husband died in 1976, my kids hadn't gone to see her for quite some time, because they were grown. She came to the funeral home when John died. My youngest was eleven, and at the point she was going to an adult doctor and not a pediatrician. I had gone to another doctor with my eldest, but I didn't like his attitude. It was always, "Maybe we should do this, or maybe we should do that." I don't want to hear "maybe" from a doctor. I want them to say exactly what has to be done. And Dr. Tyndall fit the bill perfectly. My daughter had gangrene in her foot. The other doctor kept saying she was alright every time I would bring her in. And I kept saying there was something definitely wrong with her foot. And they would say no, she was alright. Well, when I saw streaks coming up her foot, I took her to the Emergency Room. And she had gangrene, and they had to give her a blood transfusion. And of course the doctor came by and asked what was wrong. And I told him. They had to take a scalpel across the bottom of her foot. And she was humiliated. She was three years old, and she had to be pushed around in a stroller because she couldn't walk on that foot. She had to have her foot encased in a plastic bag to keep it moist. But she turned out ok, but that was the last time I ever saw that doctor. I wouldn't go back to him. You know when something is wrong with your own kids.     Mr. Aumack: Yes! Do you remember the name of that doctor?     Ms. Hague: I don't think it would be right to say his name. I don't know if he is in practice in this area at the present time.    Mr. Aumack: When did you meet Dr. Tyndall?    Ms. Hague: My kids were pretty little. It was in the mid 1950s. My daughter was three at the time, and she was born in 1953. I married in 1952, and she was born thirteen months later. I had a doctor in Cranford until we moved down here. The first fourteen months, my daughter had a different doctor up in Cranford. And then we moved down to Middletown.    Mr. Aumack: So this was a neighborhood doctor which you could all trust?    Ms. Hague: The one up in Cranford, yes. In fact, he was my obstetrician and pediatrician. He waited for my pediatrician to get out of the service to take over the pediatrics part of his practice. And Chris was his first patient. And oh, did he ever earn his money! He was at my house fifteen days straight once she got out of the hospital because she was such a sick little girl. When Chris was fourteen months old, we moved down here to Middletown.    Mr. Aumack: Where were you when you heard Kennedy had been shot?    Ms. Hague: We were just coming out of a motel in Williamsburg, where we had just finished our vacation. We went without the kids, which was very rare. My sister-in-law, who was about fifteen years old, came and stayed with our kids for a week. And we knew she was capable, and the kids just adored her. She came down for a week, and of course the neighbors were all there, too, to help out. And we went to Williamsburg for the week. We were just packing up and leaving the motel when we heard about it on the radio. And I never forgot it!    Mr. Aumack: This was in the car?    Ms. Hague: In the car, the station wagon. Tears were rolling down both our faces, and it was a very somber trip home.    Mr. Aumack: How has Monmouth County changed?    Ms. Hague: Boy, there have been a lot of big changes. I would say the biggest change I didn't like is that all the farmland is going. When there are places where there is farmland, I enjoy driving through it. When I worked in Manalapan and traveled from Middletown there, there was a lot of farmland along the way. And I enjoyed that every morning when I drove to work. At night, I was more anxious to get home than to look at the scenery. I drove past Marlboro Psychiatric Hospital on Route 79, and that is where I used to see all the farms before it changed. I worked a block from the library at Gloria Nilson Realtors. I had a part-time job there after I lost my full-time job. I worked for a couple of different agencies before I was laid off from the last job in Manalapan because they were cutting back. Of course I was the last hired, so I was the first to go. So I hadn't worked since then. I really tried, I must have tried for about 350 jobs. Unemployment says you have to try for three jobs a week, and I would try for at least ten jobs a week. But there is age discrimination, there is no doubt about that. A lot of people agreed with me, but the Unemployment Office said there was no age discrimination.    Mr. Aumack: How else has Monmouth County changed, for better or for worse?    Ms. Hague: I hated to see some of the things come into Middletown, but the Garden State Arts Center was a good thing for Monmouth County. But I think since PNC Bank has taken it over, it has gone downhill. I'd rather it go back to the Garden State Arts Center, because that's how I will always know it. My husband and I used to go over there for concerts, but they don't have concerts anymore. It's all these big name bands and singers, which don't interest us. I know for a couple of years, I used to go eight or ten times a year to a concert over there. I saw Liberace there, and it was very good. I also heard Tchaikovsky's 1812 Overture there. I am a classical music lover, so that has been a big change that I didn't like. AT&T I know has been marvelous for the area as far as jobs go, and I guess it has brought in a lot of revenue for the County. So that's why my son's taxes are lower in Holmdel than they would be in Middletown. I left Middletown because of high taxes, and he had to sell his home in Middletown because of high taxes. It was over $3,000 for a two-bedroom condo, and that is ridiculous. When I moved here to Howell, it was $1400. It's a little bit higher now, because I just got the new tax bill. But not that much higher. But it was too expensive living there, although I hated leaving there because I had been there for forty-four years. But none of my old friends lived there anymore. They all moved south, west, and to all different places. I still call Florida every month, and I have a schoolmate there. I went to school with her from second grade, and I talk to her every month in Florida. My best friend lives now in North Carolina. And I talk to her. In fact, they built the same house they had in Applebrook in Middletown. They built the same house in North Carolina. They obtained the blueprints. And the only thing different was the kitchen. The kitchen was on the meadow in Middletown, so it was downstairs. And in the new house, the kitchen is upstairs. Otherwise, the house is a duplicate. But they were good homes they built in Applebrook. They were good, sturdy, and we never had any problems. The only problem we ever had was we had to change the front door because there was a crack in it.    Mr. Aumack: Usually when they took away the farmlands they put up shopping centers, homes, and developments. Do you think with the growing number of developments going up now, do you think it is still necessary?    Ms. Hague: I would like to see less. I'll have to admit that they keep the AT&T buildings looking very nice. The property around is always well kept. But I still hate to see all the farms go. I guess I'm just an old-fashioned girl. I've always been an old-fashioned homebody.    Mr. Aumack: Is there anything you would like to say to young people of Monmouth County or anyone else? Any advice you would like to give them about raising a family or anything else?      The Hague Family, present day  Ms. Hague: Just to give children good values, to live honorable lives, and be independent. Parents have to let them be independent, with limits. You can't let them do things that you know are really wrong, but let them have their own opinions. And I think that makes a big difference. You are not going to tell a child, "Absolutely not." You need to say, "We'll talk about this and come to some kind of settlement between your idea and my idea." And I think that is what parents don't do anymore. They don't spend enough time with their children. Unfortunately, too many families have to have both parents working. It's not their fault, it's just the way things are now. And I would like to see a little more help for seniors.    Mr. Aumack: What would you like to see?    Ms. Hague: More help with prescription drugs, for one. I have heard that prescription prices are going to double. If that happens, I don't know what I am going to do. Because I just wouldn't be able to afford it. I'm on more or less a fixed income. I have some income from my husband when he died, and social security. Of course I had to apply for it when I was sixty-one, and I could get it then being a widow. But I had to take a greatly reduced amount, five hundred dollars less a month than I would have gotten if I had waited until I was sixty-five. And it hasn't gone up much since then. It hasn't even gone up one hundred dollars in nine years.     Mr. Aumack: Do you think the big insurance companies have ruined it for senior citizens?    Ms. Hague: Yes. I have an HMO, and there are restrictions.    Mr. Aumack: Before the present restrictions came, were there any problems?    Ms. Hague: I never had any problems with the medical. The biggest problem I had was pre-existing conditions. A lot of people in my family have had problems with their feet. They asked my grandmother if she had had polio, which she did. It was just something she inherited, which my mother inherited. And I inherited it, and two of my children inherited it. And because it was a pre-existing condition, I had an eight thousand dollar hospital bill they wouldn't pay for. Also it was because of my boss, who kept changing our medical coverage every year. I had to wait two years before they would cover it. Well, I literally could not walk. I could not wait the two years. I needed surgery, but as I had no coverage, I had to pay the eight thousand dollar medical bills myself, which is hard when you don't have much of an income. It took me more than three years.    Mr. Aumack: Why do you think you didn't receive the money that you deserved?    Ms. Hague: Because they wouldn't pay for anything pre-existing until you have had the policy for two years. All insurance companies are that way. This was through the coverage I had through my work, through my job. I don't know if the HMO is the same way or not. But I know seniors could use a lot more help. I'm not just talking about me, I have heard cases that are unbelievable for seniors.    Mr. Aumack: Is there anything else you would like to say to Monmouth County residents?    Ms. Hague: Enjoy your life here. You only have one life to live, so enjoy it. I try to. I can't get around very easily anymore, but I enjoy it. I have family close by, which is great. And all seniors should have family close by. And if not, they should get as many friends as possible. I have made some nice friends here, and having grandchildren is the greatest.    Mr. Aumack: Well, that is a good place to stop. I thank you very much.       
MonmouthCounty;Jeannette Morton;1911;1999;Jeannette Morton, 1911, 1999        Remembering the 20th Century: An Oral History of Monmouth County      Jeannette Morton with her pig collectibles  Date of Interview: September 15, 1999  Name of Interviewer: June West  Premises of Interview: Navesink House, Red Bank, NJ  Birthdate of Subject: July 30, 1911    Ms. Morton: I am Jeannette Morton. I was born in Long Branch in 1911, the seventh child of Frank and Anna Brown Morton. My dad was a Pennsylvania railroad engineer. He worked as a passenger service man for about forty years as an engineer. My mother was a homemaker and never had outside work of any kind. I attended Long Branch public schools all my life. I was graduated from the Long Branch Senior High School in June of 1928 and attended the Newark Normal School in Newark, NJ for two years. I was employed by the Long Branch Board of Education for two and one half years. Because of the Depression era and not having tenure, I lost my job. But in 1936 I was employed by the West Long Branch Board of Education and gave them thirty-five years service. Since retiring, in fact before retiring, I did a great deal of traveling. I have visited every one of our fifty states and have a map in my apartment showing these fifty states. This map is made of counted cross-stitch by me. I have traveled in Europe, also China and Russia. Now I am very much enjoying a life of leisure in Navesink house.    Ms. West: I guess you've traveled extensively through Monmouth County as well?    Ms. Morton: Well, I think I've seen Monmouth County pretty well also because I like to take just little trips now and then around the area. I know quite a bit about New Jersey as well, because I also enjoyed my home state.    Ms. West: Are there any historical points of interest in Monmouth County you'd like to tell us about?    Ms. Morton: Well, I always make sure that I told my children in school about the Monmouth County Museum in Freehold and have taken many classes there to see the great things that they have on display there.    Ms. West: Such as? If you can recall.    Ms. Morton: The artifacts that they had concerning the Revolution are excellent. The man who did the lecturing was a great fellow. Their display of toys and small artifacts that amuse the children at that time was very, very good.    Ms. West: Do you recall the kinds of toys the children played with?    Ms. Morton: Oh, the dolls especially.    Ms. West: And what about the boys  what kind of toys did they have?    Ms. Morton: Trucks. Well guns of course, were the things for the boys. Another place of interest for children as well as adults was, I guess it's called the State Park now down at Allaire. I've taken many classes there as well. The old buildings and the general store were of great interest.    Ms. West: What historical interest did that have?    Ms. Morton: Well, that was the place where iron was going to be made, but they found that they couldn't get enough coal to run their furnaces, and so it didn't last very long.    Ms. West: Is there any location in Monmouth County that has personal significance to you?    Ms. Morton: No, I think the whole county is a very lovely place to travel. Our roads are very adequate, and the farmlands, many of which are now disappearing, were always lovely to look at any season of the year.    Ms. West: Is there any particular person in the county or including your parents, of course, who played a very significant part in your life or was a great influence to you?    Ms. Morton: No, I don't think so. I always thought quite highly of two of the principals under whom I worked, Elmer Barnett and William Kate, both connected with the Long Branch public schools.    Ms. West: How did they impact your life?    Ms. Morton: Well, they were people that you looked up to because you felt they were good citizens and people who could give advice when needed and were there just as a good friend.    Ms. West: Well how would you describe Monmouth County in your childhood, then in your youth, and now?    Ms. Morton: Well, of course as a child I didn't get very far from my home because we had no car. My dad was a railroad engineer and everywhere that we went we went on the train. Consequently, traveling as a youngster was very limited, but since my own car came into existence, why, naturally I did a great deal more traveling.    Ms. West: How were the schools when you were going to school as compared to when you began teaching?    Ms. Morton: Well, I guess I'll have to say I don't think I saw very much of a difference. The only thing is we had a lot more supplies when I became a teacher than what we had as a youngster. I recall learning to read from charts that were posted in the room. I don't recall having a book to read from till maybe the third grade. Our reading was done by means of using a chart with stories and so forth. But in my teaching experience, I had ample material books and papers and so forth to work with.    Ms. West: Speaking of books, did you have a favorite book that you liked to read as a youngster?    Ms. Morton: I made it my business to read to the children in my class everyday, and I've had more than one child come to me since I have been retired and said one of the things that we enjoyed most was hearing you read to us everyday.    Ms. West: Were you a reader when you were a youngster?    Ms. Morton: Yes, I always enjoyed books.    Ms. West: Do you have a favorite author?    Ms. Morton: No.    Ms. West: Just liked to read.    Ms. Morton: I very much like to do handwork, also as evidenced by things around my house.    Ms. West: What games did you play as a youngster?    Ms. Morton: We played with the neighborhood children a game called "kick the wicket," and it was really sort of like a ball game I guess. We had a stick posted on the sidewalk and you kicked that and ran the bases. We did that at the four corners of the street. There was no traffic at night and we could go out and play kick the wicket. We played tag and hide and go seek. A girlfriend and I rolled our doll carriages up and down the street. When I was older than that I used to do a great deal of roller-skating. I enjoyed roller-skating with the neighborhood children.    Ms. West: How were the roller skates then as compared to the skates that the children are using today?    Ms. Morton: Oh, I wore out two pairs of roller skates. I was a very heavy child, very stout and heavy, and I wore out two pair of roller skates. But they were ordinary roller skates.    Ms. West: What were they made of?    Ms. Morton: Steel.    Ms. West: So now while you and the girls were out pushing the doll carriages, or what have you, what were the boys doing? Did the boys and girls play some of the games together?    Ms. Morton: Boys and girls roller-skated together. Kick the wicket was usually with the boys. We played tag and hide and go seek with the boys.    Ms. West: What is kick the wicket? Anything like cricket? Are you familiar with cricket?    Ms. Morton: I'll explain it to you. Then another thing when I could go by myself, I did a great deal of swimming, because I lived close to the ocean and went swimming practically everyday.    Ms. West: Do you know anything about your ancestors?    Ms. Morton: No.    Ms. West: Did you have any heroes or heroines when you were a little one?    Ms. Morton: Don't remember.    Ms. West: What type of music did you like?    Ms. Morton: Classical music.    Ms. West: Always?    Ms. Morton: Always. I've never enjoyed other music.    Ms. West: What were the clothing fads of the day when you were a young girl?    Ms. Morton: Well, because I was, and this is very personal, because I was such a big girl most of my clothing had to be made. To get something to fit me that wasn't too old looking, we had to have a dressmaker come once a year and make clothes. I make a number of my clothes even today.    Ms. West: Do you remember the first movie you ever saw? Did you like going to the movies?    Ms. Morton: Yes. I went often to Saturday matinees, but I don't remember the first one that I saw. One of the first stage productions that I saw was Oklahoma which to me was wonderful. I remember going to the Hippodrome in New York on occasion, and of course it was a big treat to be taken to New York. The Hippodrome was a place where there were many different reviews. They had a swimming pool there right on the stage. I've seen a locomotive on the stage there, too.    Ms. West: Oh, really. That's interesting. Do you have any hobbies?    Ms. Morton: I would say my desire to do handwork: knitting, crocheting, sewing.    Ms. West: You have done that all your life.    Ms. Morton: Yes. As a youngster, I would be getting ten or fifteen cents to go down to Woolworth's and buy something to embroider. I was never denied as long as I finished the one piece that I did. When I finished one, I could go get another one.    Ms. West: Now that you mention Woolworth's, could you tell me something about Woolworth's?    Ms. Morton: Oh, Woolworth's was a wonderful place to go. They had everything.    Ms. West: What was Woolworth's?    Ms. Morton: It was a five and dime. There were stores all over.  There was a big one in Long Branch and there was a lovely one in Asbury Park and one here in Red Bank that I remember going to.    Ms. West: Did you go to Asbury Park much since you lived in Long Branch?    Ms. Morton: Asbury Park and Red Bank were our two shopping areas. If you couldn't get it in Long Branch, you went to either one of those other towns.    Ms. West: If you could choose any symbols, what symbol would you use to represent you in your life?     Ms. Morton: Well, I enjoy teaching very much. I think I made a little imprint. I've had students who became nurses, teachers, our Monmouth County judge was one of my pupils, Bill Haggen. Two or three of my pupils became lawyers, dentists, doctors, so I guess I shed a little light.    Ms. West: I would think so. What grade did you teach?    Ms. Morton: Mostly fifth grade, but I had experience in kindergarten through eighth.    Ms. West: Then you laid a good foundation for many a person here in the county. What would you say has been your greatest achievement in life?    Ms. Morton: I'm very proud of some of the handwork that I've done, if that means anything. Making my own clothes and the bedspreads I designed and made  I have also crocheted bedspreads.     Ms. West: Is this just for a hobby?    Ms. Morton: Just because I like to do it.      Jeannette Morton with her pig collection  Ms. West: What would you say is the most unusual thing about you? How many other people handle more than 200 pigs in their house? Tell me about the pigs.    Ms. Morton: Oh, our collection of pigs is close to 200. It was started by my sister Elva Davis and comes from all over. There are pigs from all over the country and every time I visit a country I bring a pig home.    Ms. West: How did the pig collection get started?    Ms. Morton: Well, it was something my sister liked. She loved to play with the pigs on my uncle's farm.    Ms. West: Where was this farm?    Ms. Morton: Belmar. One summer when she and my brother went to visit Uncle Wilson they came home and found a new baby sister. Me. Then when she married and her husband retired they had a farm in Marlboro and the suggestion was made that they raise pigs. She said that was all right with her, and she'd bring one in and use it as a pet. But instead a collection of pigs got started. No pigs were raised. I inherited the collection of pigs from her and they're mine until I finish with them.    Ms. West: Do you have any nieces and nephews?    Ms. Morton: I had eight nephews and two nieces. I've lost two nephews and one niece so far.    Ms. West: Maybe one of them will inherit the collection or one of their children will inherit the collection. You certainly have a lot of pigs. I didn't know that pigs came in all positions, I would say.    Ms. Morton: All positions and all kinds. I have the native coal. I have several native coal, brass, disk, wood, just about everything. I also have a great, great, great niece.    Ms. West: Was that three greats? Boy, she's a lucky little girl. She doesn't know it, I'm sure.    Ms. Morton: Five generations.    Ms. West: Isn't that wonderful. Not many people can attest to that. They go to three, well maybe to fourth generations, but still it's quite a thing.    Ms. Morton: People are living longer these days. After all, I'm eighty-eight years old.    Ms. West: Well, except for the record, I wouldn't tell anyone. As the old saying goes "you carry it right well." What are your values in life?    Ms. Morton: I like to see things dealt with fairly. I don't like to see anyone given privileges over someone else. Rules are made to be obeyed. If you can't curve the thing that's going on, don't make any rule about it, just let it go. But when a rule is made, it should be obeyed. Don't feel that you're the only one around to be pleased. There are 200 other people here in this place. I'm not the only one.    Ms. West: Is there anything about your life that you would change?    Ms. Morton: I don't think so.    Ms. West: Anything that you would like to do that you haven't done or tried?    Ms. Morton: I'd love to go to Japan, but I don't expect to go there. I've been to China, but I don't expect to get to Japan.    Ms. West: You never know. What advice would you give to the young people today, if one of your grandnieces or nephews were looking for a little direction or a little more direction, because life is so complicated today?    Ms. Morton: Just be honest with yourself and other people. I think honesty is one thing that would help a great deal. Think of others. I believe in the Bible:"Do unto others as you have them do unto you." I think there's a lot of people in this world who don't think about that at all, and that's where some of our trouble comes from. Home life, I just can't understand why we have the type of crime that we have with young people if there's any home life. There must not be. When I was growing up, I knew that my mother was going to be home when I went home, and that my father would come home. He seldom was with us because he worked all day, but I knew that he was going to come home at night. We had a family. It was very rare for the whole family to sit down with my father for a meal because he didn't get home till eight or nine o'clock at night many times. But we were a family. You just knew that there were rules and laws that you had to pay attention to or else you were punished. That doesn't go today, I guess, from what we see in our newspapers and see on our televisions.    Ms. West: What legacy do you think you might have left your students, your nieces, nephews?    Ms. Morton: Well, we always had fun when they came to Grandma's. That's what they tell me now when I see them. I guess I must have been there to engineer the fun.    Ms. West: Sounds good to me. What would you think is the most unusual thing about yourself?    Ms. Morton: The fact that I was able to go to so many places and see so many wonderful things in this world. In studying geography as a youngster, I thought, "Oh! wouldn't it be nice to be able to see these things and to stand in front of those pyramids there in Egypt," and I did.    Ms. West: A lot of us don't see it beyond the geography books.    Ms. Morton: It was a wonderful thing to be able to drive my first car, which I didn't do until 1956.    Ms. West: What was your first car?    Ms. Morton: It was a lovely Chevrolet.    Ms. West: How were the roads and things in the county then compared to the way they are now?    Ms. Morton: Oh, I think we've had good roads in Monmouth County. All of them that I traveled on were fine.    Ms. West: Growing up in Long Branch, did you live in beach community? Did you grow up on a farm?    Ms. Morton: No. Oh, I visited the farm, but not to stay.    Ms. West: Are your siblings here in the county?    Ms. Morton: Some of them lived right here in Red Bank. My oldest sister moved to Red Bank and her children grew up here. They're still a couple of them are still right in Eatontown. I have two nephews out in California, whom I have visited many times.    Ms. West: How were the hospitals in the county? How do they differ from when you were a child as far back as you can remember? How was the service? What was offered in the hospitals?    Ms. Morton: The Monmouth Medical Center in Long Branch was just a one building affair when I first remember. Then they built an addition to it. Tore down the front of it and built an addition there, which is still there. They are doctors' offices now. Then of course many years later that plant has come there. One of my sisters trained there as a nurse, and I was called upon many times to take uniforms, which another sister washed and ironed. Until I got a chance to go into the main lobby of the hospital she would meet me there to pick it up. I think the service that they offer has always been excellent.    Ms. West: Were doctors and other medical aids accessible here in the county?    Ms. Morton: Yes.    Ms. West: It was apparently adequate back then.    Ms. Morton: Well, in those days of course, way back as far as when I was a youngster, the doctor came to the house. You didn't have to go to his office. He came to the house. You could go to the office if you were able, but they made house calls.    Ms. West: Were your mother and father born here in the county?    Ms. Morton: Dad came from Manasquan and Mother from Belmar.    Ms. West: So they're both from Monmouth County. And their parents?    Ms. Morton: Their parents were all from the same area.    Ms. West: Oh, then you go back generations in Monmouth County.    Ms. Morton: I had a man visit me one day about some property that Morton family was supposed to inherit and I asked him where he thought we Mortons originated? He said as far as he could determine there were Mortons who came over from England with Roger Williams. A Scottish Parcer who I met on one of the ships that I took to Europe said the Mortons were also prominent in Scotland so apparently they came from British Islands. My grandparents were also born in the United States and my great grandparents. I never knew the great ones, and I knew only one grandparent. My two grandmothers and one grandfather were gone when I was born.    Ms. West: Did they live on farms?    Ms. Morton: No. The grandfather that was alive was a fisherman down at Belmar Fisheries. What's now the Belmar Marina was Shark River at that time. The grandfather Morton was a farmer.    Ms. West: What did he raise?    Ms. Morton: General farming.    Ms. West: For sale or just for family?    Ms. Morton: I'm sure more or less for family and probably neighborhood.    Ms. West: I guess you've enjoyed your life here in Monmouth County, or else you wouldn't have stayed here.    Ms. Morton: I would have gone elsewhere, I'm sure.    Ms. West: Just looking here out on the Navesink River, it seems so peaceful. It must be heavenly in the summertime.    Ms. Morton: It's beautiful all seasons of the year.    Ms. West: Oh, I could imagine looking out here at the trees when the fall comes. It must be very colorful, and before you know it, it's going to be all nice and green again. What are your personal strengths?    Ms. Morton: Oh I don't know how to answer that.    Ms. West: Tell me, did your mother and dad or your grandparents pass any stories on like you do generation after generation?     Ms. Morton: My mother and father must have lead very quiet lives because everything was always so easygoing, so quiet in our home. Never any fuss or bother  no arguments or anything like that. I think Mother and Father were a very devoted couple. He was only seventy-two years old, but that was back in 1939, seventy-two was a fairly good age for a person at that time. Mother lived nine years longer. It was always a very happy home when people came.    Ms. West: What major changes have you seen in your lifetime?    Ms. Morton: I think the way people behave toward one to another.    Ms. West: How does it differ?    Ms. Morton: There was no thought of doing harm to somebody else. You wanted to do good. If you saw somebody in trouble, you helped them. Today you pass them by on the street.    Ms. West: What other changes have you seen?    Ms. Morton: The way things are done, the way we shop in particular. You went to one grocery store  you had a clerk to wait on you. Took all the things from the shelf as you wanted them, out of the bins or whatever, and got them all together. You don't have that today. You have to fend for yourself when you go into the store. Big difference to me as far as shopping is concerned. News in the newspaper: our newspaper Long Branch Daily Record was just local news. Once in a while there would be something about New York or maybe Europe, but today there's no local news. It's all what's happened in the world when you pick up the paper.    Ms. West: Was your father in World War I?    Ms. Morton: No. I didn't have any brothers in the service, either. I had nephews in the service.    Ms. West: Being handy with your hands, did you do any work for the Red Cross?    Ms. Morton: Yes. I did volunteer for the Red Cross in World War II. In World War I, I knitted washclothes for the soldiers. That's how I learned to knit, making washclothes in World War I. In World War II, I went and made bandages.    Ms. West: You did all that for the Red Cross.    Ms. Morton: And also the USO furnished refreshments in the Second World War.    Ms. West: Were there any troops stationed near by?    Ms. Morton: Fort Monmouth. I don't know whether they were actual troops, but that was a Signal Core Installation and where troops were trained.     Ms. West: How did you heat your home when you where a youngster?    Ms. Morton: With a coal furnace. We had to shovel coal in it. There was a big coal bin down in the cellar and you lay in coal and hoped it would last all winter. If it didn't, why you had to find more. We carried out those ashes everyday. There was no means of controlling the temperature like we have on a heating apparatus today.    Ms. West: No thermostat.    Ms. Morton: No thermostat, no.    Ms. West: How did you get around?    Ms. Morton: Walked. I walked to school even while I was teaching.    Ms. West: How far was home from school?    Ms. Morton: About a mile. As a youngster, I walked to school in the morning, walked home at noontime. Because we had an hour and a quarter for lunch, we did not stay at school for lunch. Then I'd walk back again and home after school. I would say it was close to a mile that I walked. Up until the time that I got the car, I walked even when I was teaching. There was no bus transportation that was anywhere near that I could use. If you went anywhere on the train you walked from home to the station. In very bad weather, you might be able to afford a taxi, a jitney. Jitney fare was a nickel, but sometimes you didn't have a nickel.    Ms. West: What was a jitney?    Ms. Morton: It was like a small bus. There's nothing left on the road today that is comparable as far as I can see. One little story about the blizzard of 1914. My sister was having a baby and my mother came to Red Bank to be with her. When she went home to Long Branch, she went on the first train that went through after the blizzard. The train slowed close to the street on which we lived in Long Branch, and she asked the conductor if she could get off. He said, "Well, lady you're going to go to your waist in snow." But she said, "I just live up the street, and I'd have a much shorter walk home than I would if I went all the way to the station." That was March 1st in 1914.    Ms. West: You don't get snows like that anymore.    Ms. Morton: No transportation but, as I say, this jitney was like a small bus. They were at the station. You walked you didn't take that.    Ms. West: Now that we've come to the turn of the century, what hopes or aspirations do you have for this new millennium?    Ms. Morton: It looks to me as though were depending too much on mechanical things  especially this new Internet and that type of thing. I feel that already harm has come from it and I feel that there's a place where a lot more harm can come from it, as well as good of course, but harm has harmed too much.    Ms. West: Harmed how?    Ms. Morton: Getting people involved in things that are harmful. These scams and things that people take up with.    Ms. West: Do you think there will be an about face later on somewhere down the road?    Ms. Morton: I wouldn't want to predict that, but I just feel that there's just too much mechanical business.    Ms. West: Is there anything else you'd like to tell us?    Ms. Morton: I don't think so.    Ms. West: It's been my pleasure meeting you, and I'm glad you were willing to be one of our subjects. If you think of anything else that you might want to add to this, I'll be around. Thank you so much.    Ms. Morton: You're very welcome.
MonmouthCounty;Jane Reid Zdancewic;1918;1999;Jane Reid Zdancewic, 1918, 1999        Remembering The 20th Century: An Oral History of Monmouth County      Jane Reid Zdancewic  Date of Interview: September 22, 1999  Name of Interviewer: Lydia Wikoff  Premises of Interview: Ms. Wikoff's home, Manalapan, NJ  Birth date of subject: June 27, 1918    Ms. Zdancewic: Hello! I am Jane Reid Zdancewic. I was born in Tennent. I was the daughter of Florence Griffin and Edgar Denise Reid. My mother was born on Long Island at the Van Wyck Homestead out there in Woodbury. Her mother was Susan Jane Van Wyck, and her father was William Henry Griffin. They were farmers, as most people were in those days. Mother recalls the big old homestead as having a huge cook-in fireplace. She could sit in one corner of the fireplace when the fire was going. It was that big. She also said that she remembered seeing Teddy Roosevelt riding by on horseback past their farm. She also remembered that they had some of the earliest automobile races around the roads on Long Island. This would have been around the turn of the century. Around that same time, development was coming out to their area from New York City, so the family moved to farm in Monmouth County, and mother, while visiting one of her family there, attended Old Tennent Church, and that is where she met my father, who was the son of William Henry and Emma Taylor Reid.       William Henry Reid II (Jane Zdancewic's brother) arrived December 28, 1913.   He was born in the house that my grandparents built on Craig Road. That house is still standing today. He had three brothers and two sisters. They loved to do all kinds of things outdoors. They would walk around the fields and check on wildflowers, and because of that, I have a love of wildflowers, which I've inherited from my dad, and I passed it on to my kids. My Dad and Mother bought a farm when they married in 1913 on what is now Church Lane in Manalapan Township. It was a very nice home, and fairly new when they bought it, and they spent their entire married life in that house. That is where I was born in 1918. We were very fortunate in that shortly after my folks moved there, the main line for electricity and telephone came from Freehold, down Craig Road, and down Church Lane going to Englishtown for the borough of Englishtown. One of mother's good friends, a Mary Gould who was her neighbor on Long Island, was an operator of the Englishtown Telephone Office, and she was there for many years in that office when they had all the wires and all the plug-ins for telephones. I remember going there and watching them operate that part there. Our social life was connected with church and visiting families, and outdoor things. Of course, there were no such things as televisions or even radios when I was first born. We played all kinds of games as kids growing up together. Some are still playing these games: hide and seek, red lights, jump rope, hopscotch, marbles, and giant steps. There were several other games that we used to play together.  As I say, our social life was visiting back and forth with families. I had cousins in Mount Holly and Pennsylvania, and we would visit them. There weren't movies to go to at first either. Our lives were quite simple. As I was growing up, my mother was quite a seamstress, and I learned to sew at a very young age. By the age of eleven, I was making all of my own clothes. I was kind of a chubby kid, so I couldn't go in the store and buy things ready made. (Laughs)       Jane Reid Zdancewic and brother, Bill eating apples  We were quite poor, but we were happy, and we did not realize it. I lived through the Depression when sometimes we would have some kind of a meat maybe only once a week. And the rest of the time, we'd eat the potatoes and the vegetables that we grew. Cottage cheese we made because we had a cow, which we milked, and we made butter, also.  We had a few chickens, and mother could collect extra eggs, and extra cheese, and extra butter, and she would go to the store and swap it for the things that we needed like flour and sugar that we didn't have on the farm ourselves. We raised a few pigs, and that was some of the meat we had. Many times, I can remember helping my mother prepare meat. She would put it in jars and would cook it in a water bath for about three or four hours to preserve it. When we had pigs, she'd make pork sausage, and she would cook it and put it into a crock and cover it with lard, the fat. And by doing that, it would keep.       Jane Reid (Zdancewic), 1923  And then many times, she did much canning, as I did all through my life and since I have retired in the last few years. I remember we had a huge white amber cherry tree in our yard, and that the branches hung over the porch roof. My dad more than once would go up into that tree, and he would pick a whole milk bucket full of cherries, and we would can those. And, oh, they were so good in the winter to eat. All these little things.    You asked me if I remembered tramps. Yes, I remembered tramps. They came around during the Depression years when food was not too plentiful. And, we were getting along lots of times on only one meal with meat in it during the whole week's time.  This tramp, the one tramp that I remember, was Frank Walker. He came every summer and helped pick potatoes, which was one of those things that my father grew along with apples and peaches. Frank built himself a metal shack down behind the barn, and he had an open fireplace where he cooked his food, and he was as happy as could be. He loved it that way. He was a very interesting person, because he had been a sailor. He traveled all over the world, and every summer, he made sure that I had a hammock to swing in. He made it out of heavy cord, and that hammock was so made, that it didn't matter how many kids would swing in it, we couldn't fall out of it. Evidently, this was one of the things they had to learn when they were on shipboard when it was a rough sea. You couldn't fall out of that hammock. Anyhow, he loved to tell us stories about his trips. One of the things he did, he helped to build the Ben Franklin Bridge.  He worked on the cable work on that bridge, and he told us about it. "But," Mother said, "Okay, you can go and talk with him, but you must sit out in the front of the barn where I can see you when you're talking with him there." That is how careful parents were of their children in those days. This was about the time of the sequentenial of our country. And he brought me a bank that was built like the Liberty Bell. And in it he put a note, "Remember, Jane, for every dollar you put in this bank, ten cents belongs to God." That is a touching thing for a man of his caliber to say to me. Then to go on with my life, of course, I went to a one room school in Tennent through the fifth grade. And then, I went to Englishtown for the sixth grade. And just the other day, I met my sixth grade teacher again, Erma Bennett Dorrer, and she said that is where she started teaching, and she was only twenty years old at that time. So, we had quite a reminiscing time there together. I stayed in Englishtown through the ninth grade. And then, I went to Freehold High School for my last three years of high school. I was the last class to go to the Freehold High School from Englishtown. After that, they went to Jamesburg. I remember while I was in Englishtown going to school that the road , the concrete road that came from Old Bridge and went through Englishtown to Tennent was laid while I was there in school. That would have probably been about 1930 or 1931, or something like that. Before that, that road was a dirt road. So, you can see how far we have gone in these few years. I can remember one of the first tractors my father bought. It was a caterpillar tractor with track onto it. While I was going to high school, I became a member of The Grange, The Monmouth Grange, which was a family oriented social group basically of farm people. And, it was a very wonderful organization at that time. One of the things that I remember a lot about The Grange is we would put on plays, we'd put on variety shows to make money, and to help pay the mortgage off on our buildings and things like that. And another thing, I was involved with The Glee Club. And that group was probably about thirty young people. And, we'd travel all over the State giving programs. It was led by Mrs. Ruth Applegate Barclay. We had a wonderful time. Of course, Atlantic City was always where the State Grange meetings were held, and we would go down there for those programs. After I finished high school, I wanted to go on to school, but I didn't have any money for that.       Jane Reid (Zdancewic) graduate of Freehold School,  1936  Then, my mother found out there was a college in Trenton called The School of Industrial Arts that I could attend. The tuition for one semester was twenty-five dollars. I knew some people there, and this lady needed someone to come and live with her because she had lost one of her legs through cancer. She needed someone to help her with the housework. I worked with her for my board in Trenton, and I went to school for two years. After the two years with her, she said she didn't need my help anymore. So then, I was able to commute by train. The train, it was the Pennsylvania Railroad, went from Long Branch into Monmouth Junction and then from Monmouth Junction into Trenton. It turned around and it would come back. And, it made one trip in the morning and one trip at night. There were a lot of kids going to Ryder College and State Teacher's College. No others were going where I was going to school. I was the only one that went there. And, some of them went to work in Trenton. But the train only had a whistle stop in Tennent. It stopped in Farmingdale, Freehold, then Englishtown, and then Jamesburg. At that point where the station was in Englishtown, that was nothing but a freight station. And there were no houses around it. And when I would get home at night it would be six o'clock and very dark. My mother said that is no good for a young woman to be getting off a train all by herself there. So, she wrote a letter to the President of the Pennsylvania Railroad if it would be possible for that train to stop in Tennent for me. Yes, it would be if I was going to be a regular passenger. Thus, it was a whistle stop. So every night, the conductor had to see if I was on the train and blow the whistle so the engineer would stop to let me off in Tennent. Did I get a razzing about that! (Laughs) After that, I went to work down in Camp Evans, which was part of Fort Monmouth. I was helping to write books and retouching photographs that were directions for some of our early radar equipment. I worked there until I got married.       Jane Reid marries Henry Zdancewic in Tennent, New Jersey on October 23, 1943  I met Henry through the Grange. His parents both were immigrants from Poland. He was master of Jerseyville Grange, and I was going to Monmouth Grange, and he got invited to one of our annual anniversary dinners. And that is where I first met him. And, of course, these young people that were in The Grange would have dances, and so we got better acquainted by going to dances. Not that I was ever much of a dancer. So, when I married I moved all of eleven miles from Tennent over to this farm over near Smithburg, which we later called Wood-Z-Lane Farm. At first, he had just a few cows that he milked. He grew potatoes and he had some vegetables on the farm. And, it was quite a come down for me because there was no electricity in that house. There was no running water in that house, so this was quite a deal for me to step down from where I had these things. There was no central heating either in that house. By the first winter, we had a bathroom in the house. There was a little pot stove down in the basement, fired by coal, and that was the trickiest doggone thing to keep running, but that is what gave us hot water for our showers upstairs. Oh, when I was growing up as a kid, many of times I took cold showers because there was no hot water, right? (Laughs) Also, I can remember my room had no heat in it. One time, I came home from a Grange meeting with some flowers that had been given to me. I put them in a vase in my bedroom, and the next morning, it was all ice. So, I slept under many quilts to keep warm. (Laughs)       Ann and Arthur Zdancewic, 1950  After I got married, it wasn't too long, it was about a year and a half later, our son was born. Then twenty months after that, our daughter was born. They were raised on the farm. They loved farm life, which is a wonderful place to raise kids, because there is lots of space and many things to do. And very shortly afte,r Arthur, our son, was born. Henry had raised a bunch of heifers, and he was going to sell them when they had their calf and would start to milk. Well, he couldn't sell them. The next thing, he was milking four heifers with lots of milk. My mother-in-law came to see me in the hospital when Arthur was born and said, "I've got so much milk I could take a bath in it, and I don't know what to do with all this milk." Well, it was about the next day that Henry went to Elliott's Dairy in Freehold and asked if they could use some milk. He came home with a milk can and a strainer and that is when we started in the dairy business, which we continued for twenty-five years. When we sold out, we had seventy milking cows and about seventy young animals. So we had quite a sizable dairy.  Henry had been drafted for service in World War II, but when he went to the draft board, they said go home and raise potatoes. That is more important than you going into the Army. So, that is what he did. But at the end of the war there was a surplus of potatoes. They didn't know what to do with them. So the government told him to pile them up in fields and spray them with a paint so they couldn't be sold for human consumption. I guess they were going to go for alcohol or something of that nature. With that, Henry said, I don't want to grow potatoes for that purpose. I want to grow them for people to eat, so we stopped growing potatoes. We also had pigs before we had the cows, but we found out pigs could get a disease, that if you had cows on the farm, you could not sell your milk for a month after this sickness was found with your pigs. So, they went with the potatoes. Then we concentrated on the dairy herd, and it grew and so forth. By 1950, we had quite an experience. There was a hurricane came along just about Thanksgiving Day. We had just built this new chicken coop, enough to hold 1,000 birds. And, the wind came along and it took the roof off that chicken coop. Well, chickens are very funny animals. They're flighty. With that, they all piled up in two corners of the chicken coop. And half of them suffocated because they piled on top of each other. The next day the ones that survived were, of course, soaking wet. And we found out that a neighbor had an empty chicken coop, so we picked them up and moved them over there. But you know they were so upset, they never did anything. And then, it was about three or four weeks later, we discover we had tuberculosis in our herd of cows and we lost the whole herd. We didn't get to keep any of them. We had bought one cow that was evidently diseased in the spring, and in six month's time, she had infected the whole herd of cows. So, that was quite an event. The things that farmers have to go through along with fighting the weather and never getting a fair price for your food. It has been historically that way for years. We've all, a lot of us farmers, felt that farming has been controlled by the government just so that the people in the country could have cheap food.    Ms. Wikoff: After that disaster when they had to get rid of all their cows, Henry became very much involved with The United Milk Producers.    Ms. Zdancewic: Maybe I should back up a little bit. Henry started farming when he was twenty-one years old. His mother and father were both born in Poland. His father was up in the northeast corner of Poland near Lithuania and what was then Prussia. He went to school for just about two or three winters. Because at the time they were under Russian control, the schools were required to teach Russian. He had a Polish teacher. So, whenever he thought he could get away with it, he'd teach them in Polish. So, Henry's father learned both Russian and Polish. He learned some German and he learned some Lithuanian because he had friends in both of those countries. When he came to this country at the age of seventeen, in about 1900, he learned English. This man could speak five different languages. I don't know how he could do it, but he did. Henry's mother grew up in a town that was north of Warsaw, the capital of Poland. They were both farm people  both came from farm families. She came to this country following her mother. Her father had come to this country about 1898, 1897, something like that. At that time, these immigrant people worked at anything they could find, like building railroads, in the mines, things like that. He wrote letters back to his wife in Poland frequently, and I assume probably sent her money, too. Well, anyhow, these letters ceased to come. And so, Henry's grandmother left Poland and came to this country trying to find her husband. She settled in Jersey City where there was a group of Polish people living. She did as much research as she could, and she found out that her husband had been working on a crew that was building a railroad in western New York State, and that there had been a bad accident, and many of them were killed. They didn't keep records, so they didn't know who it was who was killed, and so she always figured that is what happened to her husband, but there was never any trace of him afterwards. She worked hard. She was working in a laundry in Jersey City, and was getting two or three dollars a week for her twelve hours a day work. Talk about your slave labor. Anyhow, she earned enough money so that she was able to bring her two daughters to this country. And, Henry's mother was thirteen, and his aunt was eleven, when they came to this country. They were put on boats without any family with them, only with some people that they were acquainted with, and that was it. When you stop and think about all these immigrants that came to this country and still are trying to come, they leave their home, their families behind, and they know they are not going to go see them again, at least back in those days. Today, they are a little bit more mobile and do get home once in a while. So, that was Henry's background. So, at the age of twenty-one, following the death of his father from tuberculosis, which could be cured now, back then it couldn't, he took all of the responsibility for this eighty-some acre farm, and his mother, his three younger brothers, his grandmother, who lived in the home with them, and a great grandfather who lived in the home, too. So, that was quite a responsibility for a twenty-one year old. After I married him, and we were running the dairy, he was a member of the Monmouth County Milk Producer's Association, which was affiliated with the state organization, which was called United Milk Producers of New Jersey. Within about three or four years of being a county director, he became a state officer, and then he finally became a state president. And, he held that office for seven years. During that time, he traveled. There were county organizations all over the State of New Jersey with the exception of the very urban counties. So, I can remember traveling with him many times up to Sussex County, down to Cumberland County and all the counties in between, all these annual dinners that they would have. And then, a few times when he would be attending a meeting in Syracuse representing New Jersey up there at the Dairyman's League meeting, I would go to these other meetings without him. And then many times, I didn't go to these meetings, I stayed home and helped to run the dairy with the help of a hired man and our family. My two children were quite instrumental in helping us raise cows, with the milking and so forth. But our son was not cut out to be a dairyman. He could not tolerate cows. So, and also about that same time, dairying was a very poor business to be in. And, both my children decided there were better ways of making a living than to milk cows, and we couldn't argue with them about that.    Ms. Wikoff: Jane, weren't you about the last dairy herd in Monmouth County to close?    Ms. Zdancewic: No. When Henry first became a dairyman, there were 143 dairies in Monmouth County. There are none today. When we sold our cows, I think it was in 1970, there were probably seven or eight farms that were still operating at that point. Some of the last ones were up around Allentown area. There were two or three up there, and then the last one of all was the Search Farm that sold out. And there are no potatoes grown in Monmouth County and haven't been for several years. These things are too labor intensive for this area of the country. You have to have the kind of farming that can be done with just one or two people running big equipment. And even then it's not very lucrative.    Ms. Wikoff: You still didn't tell how you would milk the cows.    Ms. Zdancewic: Actually, I never milked cows. My chore was to feed calves, and you know, help with the raising of the calves. I would check cows to find out when it was time to breed them. And, I kept all the records on their breeding, on their milk production, on calving dates. We also had a registered Holstein Friesian herd, and I was responsible for registering these animals. So, I did all the bookwork and the financial end of the business. As far as milking cows, what I did, I would wash the cows' udders to make sure they were clean before the milking machines were attached to them. And also by washing them like that, you stimulated their utters so they would let their milk down a little more easily. But, I never really got so I could milk a cow. I don't know, it wasn't my knack to do that. (Laughs) We soon learned that we had to have a generator, because if the power went off, and those cows were used to being milked with a milking machine, you could not milk them by hand anymore. And, also, when you hand milked they were bred with very large teats and then later on it wasn't necessary. So, we wanted them to have smaller ones so that they wouldn't step on themselves and hurt themselves that way.    Ms. Wikoff: I never knew that, Jane.    Ms. Zdancewic: Then we had one cow. This was before we had many registered Holsteins. She was one of the ones we bought after we lost that herd of cows to tuberculosis, which by the way, was the last herd in the state I think that was lost to tuberculosis. This cow got tangled up with a piece of barbed wire somewhere. And, she had a slit about four inches long in her utter and when I went to her to start washing her, she decided she wasn't going to be touched, and she turned around, looked at me, she kicked, and she landed on my leg and broke it. So, I couldn't do any milking help for six months after that.    Ms. Wikoff: That isn't such a proud memory is it, Jane?    Ms. Zdancewic: No, but Henry was going to sell that cow before that happened, and he sure sold her after that. (Laughs) It took two of them to milk her after that. We can't blame her for not wanting to be handled when she had had a bad sore like that on her. I forget what they did with her.    Henry was very civic minded. He was on the Board of Education. He belonged to The Republican Club, and he served on the Election Board for years and years in Manalapan Township. Through his acquaintances in the United Milk Producers, he got acquainted with people who were involved with the Farmers' Mutual Fire Association in Flemington, NJ. They wanted a director from this area of the country, so they asked him if he would do it, and he did. He served there for thirty-five or forty years, I don't recall exactly how long. Following the death of some of the older members, a man came on as president. And Henry came home from a meeting one time and said, "Gee, I could run a meeting better than that man. That man didn't want to be president." The next time they had an election, Henry got elected, and he served as their president for many years. Of course, when he was going to all these different meetings, you know who was home taking care of the farm and the dairy and so forth. But it all worked out pretty well. I got interested in wildflowers, and when I bought a new camera, that was something that he sort of encouraged me to do.  I collected photographs, slides of as many wildflowers as I could find, and being on a farm like that I had access to a lot of different kinds. On our farm in Smithburg was one of the little streams that started the Manasquan River. We were on a ridge, as that area of Manalapan Township is. One way, the waters ran toward the Manasquan River, the other way they ran up to the Manalapan Brook, which eventually ran into the Raritan River and the Raritan Bay. So on the other side, on the south side of the Manasquan River, is the Pine Barrens with your scrub pine and entirely different flowers and plants from the north side where the ground was heavier. So I had access to all of that for my photographs. Back in the 1970s and 1980s I could go down a road twenty miles per hour and look for things like that, and stop if I wanted to and take pictures. Today, your life would be in your hands if you tried to do that. When I first married Henry, the hard-top road went as far as Smithburg. If you were to go any further south on Route 537, which now goes through Holmeson, down through Great Adventure, and on down to Mount Holly, why it was a real adventure. It was just a sand-track road which you could easily get stuck in. That was from Smithburg on when I first married Henry in 1943. And see how long ago that’s been, and that road has grown, and the whole area has grown. So I have seen tremendous changes in this area.    Ms. Wikoff: Jane has pleased many people with her slideshows and lectures on wildflowers. I’ll bet she hasn’t kept track of how many organizations that have benefited from her talks, and they are wonderful. I have seen them and enjoyed them, and I just know that it has given so much pleasure to so many people.    Ms. Zdancewic: It has given me a lot of pleasure to me to be able to share them. Because if you don’t share something like that, what’s the use of it?    Ms. Wikoff: Jane also has been active in the restoration of the Village Inn, in which the Battleground Historical Society was formed thirty years ago. It has done many good things over the course of its years, and I do think Jane has been the treasurer almost all of those thirty years. And thank goodness she still is, because we need her very much.    Ms. Zdancewic: Yes, that’s true. Well, after we sold our dairy in 1970, it was kind of my turn to be active in statewide things. I was appointed by Governor Byrne to be a member of the New Jersey Historic Sites Council, and that required traveling here and there, all over the state to various places. We would try to meet in historical places as we held our meetings, and toward the end of the time we could only meet in Trenton. Our chore was to basically monitor things that were encroaching on historic places. Things like people trying to tear down a house that was on the Historic Register for a road. We also helped to determine whether places, houses, and sites were appropriate to be on the historic sites list. So it was quite an interesting thing. I got into such places as the ferry terminal up in Jersey City before any development was done and we were prowling around in some of the craziest places up there that you ever wanted to see. I was also in the ferry terminal in Hoboken, again when there were no improvements done to it. I’ve been down as far as Cape May and, as I say, up in Jersey City, and Hoboken was another. We visited many places all over the state, and that was very interesting. And then I was a trustee of the New Jersey Museum of Agriculture in New Brunswick. I got on their membership committee--this was long before there was any building or anything else up there--and I served as a trustee for twelve years up there. How are people going to know what farm life was like if there wasn’t a place like this museum? My goal was to help them get the museum set up so that there would be some way of showing people in this world what farm life was about. When I was young, at least fifty percent of the people in this country were farm people. Now, there’s about two percent that are farm people, and they are able to grow enough food for the other ninety-eight percent. So my background as a farm person, growing up on a farm and marrying a farmer, has pushed me into doing these kind of things.      Jane and Henry Zdancewic, October 1987  Ms. Wyckoff: I think you have accomplished an awful lot in these few short years. (Laugh) It’s really been remarkable, and I think that our whole population in this area should be appreciative to what you and Henry contributed over the years. It’s been wonderful.    Ms. Zdancewic: That’s one of our purposes of being here on this Earth, is to leave it in a better shape then you found it.    Ms. Wikoff: Wonderful. Thank you so much for the interview. 
MonmouthCounty;James W. Parker, Jr.;1919;2000;James W. Parker, Jr., 1919, 2000    Remembering The 20th Century: An Oral History of Monmouth County  Date of Interview: June 23, 2000 Name of Interviewer: June West Premises of Interview: 179 Shrewsbury Avenue, Red Bank, NJ Birthdate of Subject: April 20, 1919  Ms. West: Dr. Parker, Jr. is a practicing physician in Red Bank. Hello, Doctor Parker.  Dr. Parker: Hello.  Ms. West: Would you just give us your name, Doctor, and tell us something about yourself, your family, your mom, your dad, your siblings.  Dr. Parker: My name is Dr. James W. Parker, Jr. I was born in Red Bank, New Jersey at my present residence, 175 Shrewsbury Avenue, in Red Bank, in 1919. My parents were Dr. James W. Parker, Sr., and my mother was Marie Parker. They met at Howard University in 1917.  Ms. West: Where is Howard University?  Dr. Parker: Howard University is in Washington, D.C. My father graduated from Howard University in 1911, received a BA degree, and my mother went to Howard University, actually Howard Normal, because in those days the women went to Normal school, rather than the University. They met and were married in 1918. My father came to Red Bank in 1919. He had worked on the boats that came from New York to Red Bank and thereby became acquainted with the town of Red Bank and he opened his office here in 1919.  Ms. West: You say he worked on the boats. Was this during the summertime when he was in college?  Dr. Parker: Right. And he came to Red Bank at the time of the flu epidemic, which was the swine flu epidemic, which in those days many people died of. He received his reputation for treating people during that epidemic. I went to grammar school in Red Bank, at the Riverstreet School Grammar School. At that time, when I was a youngster in Red Bank, the West side of Red Bank was a mixed community comprised of Italians, Jewish people, Polish people, and we had a beautiful community at that time. There were very few Blacks in Red Bank, and so all of my playmates were of mixed ethnic backgrounds. I remember that during my school years we had beautiful teachers. All of my teachers, however, were white. I had a sister who was thirteen months younger than I. I can remember that the worst thing that could have happened to me was for me to fail, because in those days if you didn't do your work, you were left back. I finished Riverstreet Grammar School and went to Red Bank High School on Harding Road, which is now the middle school in Red Bank. My fondest memories are of my teachers. One of my most unfortunate memories is the fact that there were few Black students in Red Bank at that time because there were very few Black families at that time. Another most unfortunate memory is the fact that when I would go to the theater I would have to leave my classmates who sat downstairs in that theater and I had to go upstairs and sit in the right hand side of the balcony. I played basketball in high school  in fact I was captain of my high school basketball team for two years. When I graduated from high school I went to Howard University in Washington, D.C. and I did my undergraduate work there.  Ms. West: As a youngster did you like to read books?  Dr. Parker: Oh, yes.  Ms. West: Did you have a favorite author?  Dr. Parker: Well, I liked to read history. I liked to read medieval history  I was enthralled with reading medieval history. I also was exposed to what could be considered to be now, Black history. We were not taught Black history in school, so my exposure to Black history came from going to the library and from books that we had around the house to learn about some of our forefathers, mainly Booker T. Washington, Frederick Douglass, Washington Carver. And it's unfortunate that total history wasn't taught to us in school.  Ms. West: You mentioned about going to the movies and the movie being segregated. Do you remember the first movie that you ever saw?  Dr. Parker: Probably Tom Mix.  Ms. West: Who was Tom Mix?  Dr. Parker: He was a cowboy. Cowboy movies. I remember, of course, Tarzan movies, with Johnny Weissmuller, and I can remember specifically going to the Strand Theater here in Red Bank, which was also segregated. Blacks were allowed to sit in the last ten rows on the right hand side in the back of the theater. My sister and I took piano lessons from Miss Grace Malchoir, a white music teacher, and she wanted us to see a musical in the theater. My father didn't want my sister and me to go because he didn't want us to be segregated in that theater, but we cried, and finally he allowed us to go the theater. He sat us in the middle row of the middle section of the theater, and threatened anybody who put their hands on us, and that was a miserable movie to look at because we expected to be escorted out of the theater at any time. The Carlton Theater, which I had mentioned previously, is what is now the Count Basie Theater, named after Count Basie, who was born in Red Bank, and who was good friend of my family.   (left to right) Dr. James Parker, Sr., Count Basie, and Ed Jones  Ms. West: Who was Count Basie?  Dr. Parker: Count Basie was the bandleader who left Red Bank and went to Kansas City and had one of the most famous bands in the land. He was born here on Mechanic Street in Red Bank. His aunt was my babysitter when I was a youngster. My father was born in Aiken, South Carolina in 1888. His father, Stafford Parker, was born in slavery. He married an ex-slave named Josephine James and they moved to Jacksonville, Florida. My father had two brothers. One became a dentist in Englewood, New Jersey and the other became a pharmacist in Hampton, Virginia. My uncle in Hampton, Virginia was a track star  he graduated from Columbia University in New York. He taught track at Hampton University and opened up his pharmacy in Hampton for many years. So actually I'm proud of the fact that three boys born of slave parents were able to finish school and become professionals. Each brother had two children. My sister finished Howard University a year after I did and married a music professor who went to Howard, and he became the music director at Union University in Richmond, Virginia, and my sister was the music director of choirs in Richmond, Virginia until she died. She has a daughter, who is my niece  she teaches at Virginia State in communications at the present time.  Ms. West: Is that a college or a university?  Dr. Parker: Virginia State University. When I was in high school, I had the advantage over most youngsters my age because my father was a doctor. I can remember the Depression of 1929. I was ten years old in 1929, and I can remember grown men standing in line to receive food from food kettles. I can remember walking along the railroad track in Red Bank to pick up coal to put in the furnace. My first job was with an auto repair person who was a patient of my father. My father got me the job, and I would simonize two cars a day for the salary of five dollars a week. And I can remember that. I used to pick apples as a youngster on the farms around Red Bank, particularly in Middletown, and compete with the older men when I would climb the ladder. I picked the apples for a penny and a half a bushel.  Ms. West: Was it mostly farm area around here?  Dr. Parker: When I was a youngster, yes, it was farmland all around Red Bank. My father and mother built a house and they called it out in the country, which was on Sycamore Avenue in Tinton Falls, and now it is a built up community. But in those days that was considered out in the country.  Ms. West: Were there any people in Monmouth County who had any particular influence in your life?  Dr. Parker: My father had the most influence in my life. And there were quite a few people, too, older people in Red Bank who influenced me.  Ms. West: And how?  Dr. Parker: There was a dentist by the name of Dr. Dabney who was the first Black dentist I think probably in Monmouth County. My godfather was Dr. E.A. Robinson who was a physician in Asbury Park. In fact, when I was a youngster, we did not have access to the hospitals in Red Bank. I was born on Bank Street here in Red Bank, and my father delivered me. My sister was born in my house on Shrewsbury Avenue and Dr. Robinson delivered her. And my father delivered most of his patients at home. It wasn't until I came back from the Korean War in 1953 that I was able to deliver patients in Monmouth Medical Center.  Ms. West: Were you able to admit patients to Monmouth Medical Center?  Dr. Parker: Not at that time, not before - there was not a Black doctor on the staff of Monmouth Medical Center or Riverview Hospital. At that time Riverview Hospital was a little house. And I can remember there was a doctor by the name of Dr. Hazard who had a small hospital on Washington Street in Long Branch and that's where Black women had their babies.  Ms. West: Well, if a Black person had an illness that warranted hospitalization, where did he go?  Dr. Parker: You treated them mostly at home. If they went to a hospital, you had to refer them to a white doctor.  Ms. West: So was this something that was going on throughout the county?  Dr. Parker: As far as I know, because there were not Black doctors on the staff at Fitkin Hospital, which is known now as Jersey Shore Medical Center, and there were none on the staff at Monmouth Medical Center - in fact, the only Black doctor in Long Branch was Dr. McKelvie. The Black doctors in Asbury Park at that time were Dr. Joe Carter, Dr. E.A. Robinson. Dr. Parks preceded all of them at that time, and my father here in Red Bank  they were the only Black doctors in Monmouth County. And none of them were on the staff at any hospital.  Ms. West: How do you see medicine today as opposed to back then?  Dr. Parker: Oh, it's much improved. I can remember, of course I remember medicine before antibiotics. I graduated from medical school at Howard University in 1944. I did my internship at Freeman's Hospital and I can remember when penicillin, the first true antibiotic came out in the early 1940s. When I started practicing medicine in Red Bank, about 1947, I can remember having a patient with meningitis who I treated at home.  Ms. West: Not in a hospital.  Dr. Parker: Not in a hospital. My father never delivered a baby in the hospital and he practiced from 1919 until he died in 1973. He practiced almost until the day he died.  Ms. West: Here in the town of Red Bank.  Dr. Parker: Here in the town of Red Bank.  Ms. West: So then it really hasn't been that long, when you think in terms of time, that the Black physicians could use the services of the hospitals here in the county.  Dr. Parker: That's true. I can remember when I was invited to join the staff, I remember like it was yesterday. I'd come back from Korea, I'd been practicing about five years and I had my last year in medical school under the ASTP program -  Ms. West: What does that stand for?  Dr. Parker: I don't really know, but I was in the Army, I graduated, and they needed doctors during World War II, and I was in medical school during World War II, and they were all drafted in the Army as medical students. I received my last year of medical school as a private first class in the Army.  Ms. West: Private first class.  Dr. Parker: Yes. And when I graduated from medical school, I graduated as a second lieutenant. And when I was finished and doing my residency, the war came to an end. I did my residency in a community hospital in Norfolk, Virginia. And when the armistice was declared, I resigned my commission at the completion of the war, came back to Red Bank and started practicing. The Korean Conflict broke out -  Ms. West: What year was that, do you recall?  Dr. Parker: In 1950. Because I had received my education, my last year of medical school in the Army, I was subject to draft in the military. I either had to volunteer or be drafted, so I volunteered and was sent to Brook Army Hospital in San Antonio, Texas and received my army training and within two months I was in Korea. And I stayed there for two years, and then rotated to Japan, where I was in hospitals in Tokyo, Yokohama, and Osaka. And when I returned home, after getting out of the Army, I had had quite a lot of experience overseas. I was in a battalion aide station. I gave a lecture at the hospital here in Red Bank, Riverview, and I was invited to join the staff.  Ms. West: What year was that?  Dr. Parker: 1953 or 1954.  Ms. West: Were there any Black physicians on the staff, or were you the first one?  Dr. Parker: No. I was the first Black physician.  Ms. West: On the staff of Riverview Hospital -  Dr. Parker: And Monmouth Medical Center.  Ms. West: And Monmouth Medical. Riverview now is a part of Meridian Systems, which is a conglomerate of many hospitals.  Dr. Parker: I and Dr. Wiley, who was a practicing physician in Red Bank at that time, both joined the staff at Monmouth Medical Center about the same time.  Ms. West: How were you all accepted at the hospital with the staff itself?  Dr. Parker: All right. No problem. My father's practice was mainly white. Because they said in those days the community would revert to Black. And when I graduated from Red Bank High School, there were only about six Blacks in my class who graduated.  Ms. West: Is there any location here in Monmouth County that has any personal significance to you?  Dr. Parker: In what way?  Ms. West: Any way. Something that has meaning to you.   Dr. Parker: I can remember things that I would rather forget about Monmouth County, if that's what you want to hear.  Ms. West: Anything that you'd like to say.  Dr. Parker: When I was a student in grammar school in Red Bank, I can remember that students in Fair Haven, which is only a mile or two from Red Bank, were going to a one room segregated school in Fair Haven from the kindergarten to the eighth grade and were taught by two teachers. One teacher's name was Nancy Fields, the other teacher's name was Mr. Horace Booker. And I hold them in high regard.  Ms. West: Why is that?  Dr. Parker: Because they taught those youngsters in Fair Haven as well as any student could be taught, and prepared them to come to Red Bank High School when they graduated from the ninth grade in Fair Haven. I have fond memories of a Mrs. Fields' sister, Mahala Fields, who did the same thing in Reevytown  she taught all the youngsters who lived in Reevytown and Pine Brook, you know one school -  Ms. West: What is Reevytown, or where is it?  Dr. Parker: It's a country town right out between Eatontown and Asbury Park, west of Asbury Park and west of Eatontown, out in the country. You might not know this, but  Pine Brook was an underground railroad station. Pine Brook was founded by escaped slaves who intermingled with the Sand Hill Indians, and with the families that I grew up with and descendents of whom I still treat. Those are the people Mahala taught. Mahala Fields subsequently married a Reverend Atchison, and there is a beautiful school on Sycamore Avenue in Tinton Falls named after Mahala Atchison.  Ms. West: How did Reevytown get its name?  Dr. Parker: From a family of Reevys.  Ms. West: Was the family connected with the underground railroad?  Dr. Parker: Part of it. They settled out there and the large family of Reevys are scattered all over Monmouth County at the present time. There are Reevys in Fair Haven, Reeveys in Eatontown. The Richardsons, the McGuires, the Dalhamous, the Berrys, and all of these people were descendents of escaped slaves. The church in Reevytown was started by the people who lived out there, and it was first called, in fact Reevytown. I mean, Pine Brook was called originally Macedonia, and Macedonia AME Zion Church was established. But interestingly, before it was established they used to have preachers come by horseback on Sundays to preach to the residents out there.  And I had the original log of that church. It was given to me by a man by the name of Peter Rock. Now the Rocks were settled about in that area. Mr. Rock was the first Black printer in Monmouth County. He was the son of old man Peter Rock, who was the son of a slave, and he was the first printer right up here on West Bergen Place here in Red Bank.  Ms. West: The first printer?  Dr. Parker: The first Black printer.  Ms. West: The first Black printer.  Dr. Parker: The first Black printer here in Monmouth County. And his son was the one who gave me this log. I can't remember who I gave it to, but I haven't gotten it back. It's very interesting  it had all the names of all the parishioners of this church and it's interesting to me because it gives origins of the families who I've treated for over fifty years. And I can show them where their lineage is. That was interesting. Now you asked me some of the interesting things that I did when I was a kid.  Ms. West: I was also going to ask you about the physical changes that have taken place in the county.  Dr. Parker: Terrific physical changes. I can remember a street car that went right by this house. And it stopped right here at Newman Springs Road -  Ms. West: Now you're speaking of a streetcar?  Dr. Parker: A trolley car -  Ms. West: Okay, I was going to ask if it ran on a track. Okay. A trolley car.  Dr. Parker: I can remember that. I can remember the bus was called the Belt Line. And the driver of the bus was named Mr. Fred Matthews. It would start up here at Newman Springs Road. I can remember when Shrewsbury Avenue went as far as Newman Springs Road and then it was a country road. And I can remember the only way you could get to Asbury Park from Red Bank was to go through West Long Branch. I can remember before there was such a thing as Highway 35.  Ms. West: Do you recall about what year it was when the trolley cars were running?  Dr. Parker: It had to be about 1924, 1925, 1926, somewhere in there.  Ms. West: And the trolley car ran from Newman Springs Road to where?  Dr. Parker: All the way to Fair Haven.  Ms. West: To Fair Haven.  Dr. Parker: That was your means of transportation. I can remember when they had the pumping station where the trains would get water by the station down here, where they'd have to pump water into the train -  Ms. West: Were these are trains traveling interstate?  Dr. Parker: No. Not interstate. It was just between here and Long Branch and Asbury and Perth Amboy.  Ms. West: Oh, you're talking about the railroad chain -  Dr. Parker: There was no such thing as electric trains, you know that.  Ms. West: Oh, yes, yes.  Dr. Parker: So the trains used to have a turntable right down here where the train would stop here, and then the engineer would turn the train around. You'd take the engine off and then turn the engine around. We used to go out there and turn the engines around -  Ms. West: Oh, something like the cable cars in San Francisco?  Dr. Parker: Yes, yes. Then they come on the other end of the train. And then the train used to have to stop at Perth Amboy because that's when it would become electric, the electric only came about as far as Perth Amboy. It was a coal train from here all the way down to the seashore. I can remember when the ice on the river used to get two feet thick.  Ms. West: Two feet thick?  Dr. Parker: Yes. Two feet thick. The airplanes would land on the river.  Ms. West: Airplanes coming from where?  Dr. Parker: Casey's field here just above Newman Springs Road where Shrewsbury Avenue keeps on going now-  Ms. West: Is that part of Red Bank?  Dr. Parker: No, it's Tinton Falls.  Ms. West: Oh, that's Tinton Falls, okay.  Dr. Parker: There'd be an airplane field there where Casey had a one winged airplane and he used to fly all over.  Ms. West: Who was Casey?  Dr. Parker: He was a pilot. We used to call it Casey's Field. And Casey would take you up if you wanted to pay him and he'd fly around to look over Red Bank and such - and often times he would land in people's houses because he couldn't make the field, and he'd land on the ice, too. Red Bank was the ice boating capital of Monmouth County at that time. And we used to skate, and every kid, even during the Depression, had a pair of ice skates and a Flexible Flyer.  Ms. West: Can I ask you what is a Flexible Flyer?  Dr. Parker: It's a sled.  Ms. West: Oh, okay.  Dr. Parker: And we used to take the skates and take a kite and start up there at Newman Springs Road on the river and sail down the river on your ice skates and your sled. We'd go down to where Marine Park is where Riverview Hospital is now. All the way down almost to Fair Haven. And sometimes there were cars out on the ice when it was so thick.  Ms. West: Really?  Dr. Parker: I'm telling you. Now winters in the past provided more ice on the river than in recent years. One winter, in my youth, we had thirty inches of ice on the river.  Ms. West: That's two and a half feet!  Dr. Parker: That's right. That's right. They would rough shod a horse and they'd carry coal from Red Bank to Fair Haven on the river.  Ms. West: Because the ice was so thick.  Dr. Parker: That ice was so thick. And they used to have iceboat regatta on Red Bank's ice - on Shrewsbury River. We called it Navesink river. I can remember my neighbor who lived right up the street here. Once when she was down there skating on the ice, Casey came with that airplane and landed on the ice and the propeller killed her. Ran right into this woman. Her name was Hannihan, Grace Hannihan. Her brother tried to save her, and he lost his arm. He died a few years ago. The propeller hit her and killed her. Her husband is the one who built this house.  Ms. West: That's a nice piece of history.  Dr. Parker: So we don't see the ice on the river anymore. The youngsters used to do what the youngsters don't do now  that is they had fun. Out in the open, on the ice, and in the river. We used to crab, get a rowboat, go out on the river and crab. We'd spend all day out there, having fun. When winter came, you'd get on the ice and skate on the river and you'd have fun. You didn't have to go inside to have fun and do the things that happen when you come inside. I didn't smoke my first cigarette until I went away to college, and I didn't know anybody in high school who smoked. I didn't smoke until I thought I was grown, when I went away to college.  Ms. West: Well, tell me, speaking of your youth, did you have any favorite radio programs that you liked to listen to?  Dr. Parker: I listened to Amos and Andy and all those kind of people.  Ms. West: What kind of music did you like?  Dr. Parker: I love music  I'm a music enthusiast. I play the piano.  Ms. West: Yes, you mentioned that you and your sister took piano lessons.  Dr. Parker: I just love music.  Ms. West: All kinds of music?  Dr. Parker: Not this new jazz  I don't like that. I like music I can hum to and that has some words to it that have some meaning. I don't like this loud rock and I don't like what this is supposed to be, new jazz. I don't like that. I like the old band music. And songs that you can hum and with some meaning to it.  Ms. West: I know what you're talking about. What's the first newspaper headline that you can remember. Something that has stood out in your mind?  Dr. Parker: When Lindbergh landed in Paris.  Ms. West: Who was Lindbergh?  Dr. Parker: You don't know who Charles Lindbergh was?  Ms. West: I know who Charles Lindbergh was, but maybe somebody listening to this, or reading this someday may not know.  Dr. Parker: Oh, I see. He was the first solo plane to go from United States to Europe. He flew solo from right outside of New York, Long Island somewhere, and landed in Paris. Everybody knew he had taken off and everybody was holding their breath to see if he'd make it to Paris. And I can remember exactly where I was when I heard it. Right out there playing kick the can out on Leonard Street there, and the word came out that Lindbergh had landed in Paris.  Ms. West: You mentioned the game kick the can! Out of all the people I have interviewed, everybody speaks of hide and go seek and what have you, and in fact this past Monday I did ask a man I was talking with in West Long Branch, "Did you ever hear of a game called kick the can?" And of course he said, "Yes." But of all the people, nobody ever mentioned it, and this is one of the games that we used to play all the time. You're the first person who has ever mentioned it. If you could describe your life as a road map, how would you describe it?  Dr. Parker: I've been lucky. A pretty straight road. I've had a good life. I married my first wife the day after I graduated from medical school. Her name was Alice Williams  she was from St. Louis, and we went together all the time I was in college. I married her the day after I graduated from medical school. We had two sons  she died two years ago. I was married to her fifty-four years.  Ms. West: Do you have any grandchildren?  Dr. Parker: Yes, six grandchildren.  Ms. West: Are your sons living in New Jersey?  Dr. Parker: Yes. One's right here with me now, and the other is in Orlando, Florida. He's in security. I've had my ups and downs, but I've had it easy, and I've had it enjoyable.  Ms. West: Oh, that's good. If you could choose a symbol to depict your life, what symbol would you choose?  Dr. Parker: They tell me I'm a Taurus and I act like one. They tell me I'm tough. I don't think I am. After people get to know me, they know I'm not. But from what they tell me my outward appearance is that I'm too Taurus.  Ms. West: So you say your appearance is what you belie really. What would you say was your greatest achievement in life?  Dr. Parker: I've been on a lot of boards, you know. I was Chairman on the Board of Social Services in Monmouth County for about sixteen years. And I enjoyed that  I think I did a lot of good there. I've been rewarded for what I've done. I've tried to be a good doctor, and I have sympathy for my patients. I feel their pain, a lot. One of the reasons I feel their pain is I've had so much of what they've had, and been able to deal with it. And I'm still maintaining, unless you feel somebody's pain, you don't know what pain is. You don't know what they're complaining about.  Ms. West: Is your life different today than what you thought it might have been as a child?  Dr. Parker: I think I've been on the road map ever since I was a child. As I told you, my grandfather was a doctor, my mother's father was a doctor in Winchester, Kentucky. He was a grand old man. I remember him. So when I was in grammar school, I was preparing to be a doctor.  Ms. West: And you boys wanted to be physicians?  Dr. Parker: That's right.  Ms. West: Was there anything that you would have liked to accomplish that you haven't?  Dr. Parker: Not in particular. I wish I could have been able to play more musical instruments beside the piano, but I broke my arm as a youngster and there's certain things that I can't do with my left arm.  Ms. West: Do you do much playing of the piano today?  Dr. Parker: I play a lot. For my own enjoyment.  Ms. West: So what would you say would be your legacy to your family?  Dr. Parker: That they complete that health center up there. I think that would be one - they have great plans for that health center. And it's for people who can't afford medical care.  Ms. West: Is this a building that they are erecting or is this a building that they are converting?  Dr. Parker: They're started in a trailer up there, but they plan to purchase a building.  Ms. West: And what street is that on?  Dr. Parker: It's on Shrewsbury Avenue.  Ms. West: Shrewsbury and what?  Dr. Parker: It's on Shrewsbury, right between Catherine Street and River Street on Shrewsbury Avenue.  Ms. West: What would you say is your greatest strength?  Dr. Parker: I don't know that I'm that strong. I like to deal with people. I think I would have been a good teacher, and I try to teach as I practice medicine. And my patients will tell you that. And I like to encourage youngsters to learn. I like to encourage youngsters to prepare themselves for what they do not know that is ahead of them, and to give them some idea that if they are not prepared to take opportunities that present themselves to them, that they are going to have a tough road. Of course a lot of the youngsters think I talk too much, and I chastise them too much, but I think somebody has to do it.  Ms. West: Does the state of the world today bother you?  Dr. Parker: Yes, it bothers me.  Ms. West: How is that?  Dr. Parker: Because I think that too many people live for the day and don't think about tomorrow. It also bothers me when I look at my immediate surroundings and see how man is unwittingly greedy. Man is destroying this universe, not this universe, but this earth. And if we're not careful, it's going to be barren. We can't do some of the things that we do to ourselves and to our environment if we plan to preserve it. I'm concerned about that.  Ms. West: If a youngster, say one of your grandchildren, came to you asking for advice, what would you tell him or her?  Dr. Parker: First thing I'd tell them is to read everything that they can. Prepare yourself. Educate yourself. Because without education, you're lost.  Ms. West: Are your grandchildren aware of their family history?  Dr. Parker: They're aware of it. I don't know whether they appreciate it or not. I don't think youngsters realize, particularly our youngsters, and when I talk about our youngsters I mean Black youngsters, realize from whence they have come. And I didn't until I was grown. I wasn't a stupid kid, but I wasn't aware of a lot that I should have been aware of had I only been taught. My greatest awakening was when I went to Charleston, South Carolina. My former wife had a class reunion  she attended college in Alabama, at Talladega before she went to Howard, and some of the students that went to school with her in Talladega had a reunion in Charleston, South Carolina, and I grudgingly went to this reunion. One of the things that we did when we were in South Carolina was to go to the meeting place center  it's a theater in South Carolina, where they showed the history of Charleston. As you know, Charleston was one of the slave markets. And there were about maybe twenty of us Blacks in that theater, filled with whites, and they gave the documentary of Charleston. And they gave credit to the Black slaves who did all that architectural work in Charleston. All that iron work that survives today, all the stained glass windows that are in those churches in Charleston, that withstood the Hugo hurricane, were built by Blacks. The program gave credit to the Blacks for teaching farmers how to plant rice, which is a staple in South Carolina. As far as I knew, and I told you I was good in history, the staple in South Carolina was cotton, and I came to find out it was rice. They gave credit to a Black slave for inventing the indigo dye industry in Charleston. They gave all that. I walked out of there with my chest high.  Ms. West: I know you did.  Dr. Parker: I didn't know those things, and none of our kids know them. A lot of our youngsters are down on Black churches right now. And a lot of them don't go to church because they think it's beneath them, that there's just a lot of singing and whooping and hollering. They don't know that if it weren't for the churches, the slaves could not have made it. And I still say that a lot of the reason that Blacks have a different high blood pressure than whites is because of suppressed hostility. And it's almost about to be proved that that is true. We have discovered that there is a hormone produced in the kidneys that's sensitive to Blacks that doesn't necessarily apply to whites. The angio tension converting enzyme Ace, and that's why Ace inhibitors are better for Blacks with hypertension than whites with hypertension. They don't realize what Blacks have had to go through to reach where we are today. And they will never know unless they study and learn. Unless someone tells them. Because they start from here, not realizing what it took to get them to this place. Now they have advantages that their fore parents never even thought possible. And they're not taking advantage of it.  Ms. West: That's the sad part of it all, not taking advantage.  Dr. Parker: It is. And I give youngsters the devil, particularly young Blacks. They wouldn't any more want a white person, white boy to beat them playing basketball then the man on the moon. They just assume, they know they're better. Basketball players. It's evident by what you see on TV. They practice  they fight like mad to be better.  Ms. West: But there's academics.  Dr. Parker: Those same youngsters don't care whether they're better in the classroom.  Ms. West: That's because they're not taught. That stems from the home  their parents should be teaching them.  Dr. Parker: Of course. But you see, the advantages are out there, but you can only take advantage of something if you're prepared to accept it, or receive it.  Ms. West: Oh, yes, and only what they're exposed to. People need encouragement. They should be getting it.  Dr. Parker: When you ask me about some of the things I'm concerned about, it's also the money that they're making. And not doing anything with it. Now we have that club right there, Monmouth County Men's Club. We went to Trump Castle and stayed overnight. It's the first time I've ever been to Trump Castle  we stayed at the Taj Mahal. Glamour. Doors made of marble, chandeliers big as this room. Now we went there to spend our money. You got Blacks making millions of dollars now, and they don't own anything. Very little do we own that we can attract our money. This is what I'm concerned about. And it disturbs me that they're making all that money and not spending it wisely.  Ms. West: It bothers me also.  Dr. Parker: You know I volunteer at the same church I was christened in eighty-one years ago. I still go to the same church and I believe do unto others as you'd have them do unto you.  Ms. West: Dr. Parker, with that note we will conclude our interview, and I want to thank you very much. 
MonmouthCounty;James Truncer;xxxx;2000;James Truncer, xxxx, 2000        Remembering The 20th Century: An Oral History of Monmouth County    Date of Interview: September 5, 2000  Name of Interviewer: Flora Higgins  Premises of Interview: Thompson Park, Administrative Offices of the Monmouth County Park Systemm, Lincroft, NJ  Birthdate of Subject: N/A    Mr. Truncer: Good morning.    Ms. Higgins: Good morning. Thank you for being a part of our oral history project of Monmouth County.    Mr. Truncer: Glad to, Flora, glad to do that.    Ms. Higgins: Please tell us how you came to be in Monmouth County in the first place.    Mr. Truncer: Well, my parents moved to Upper Freehold Township in 1951. I attended Upper Freehold Regional schools, starting my sophomore year in high school.    Ms. Higgins: What high school would that be?    Mr. Truncer: This was in Allentown, Upper Freehold Regional High School, which is where I met my wife. We went through high school together. My father had his career with state parks so I was born into the business and didn't realize that's what I wanted to do, but I did have the early exposure in this field.    Ms. Higgins: What did you do after high school?    Mr. Truncer: During high school and immediately after high school I worked on a neighbor's farm. I graduated from high school in 1955, and of course, at that time Upper Freehold was grain, and potatoes, and dairy. After a year of doing various jobs I decided it was time to go on to college, so I started to pursue my studies and eventually completed my undergraduate degree at Michigan State University and also my masters at Michigan State.    Ms. Higgins: In?    Mr. Truncer: Natural Resources and Park Management. So that was the field that I found myself in at Michigan State as a part of the Department of the College of Agriculture.    Ms. Higgins: So you came back then to Monmouth County?    Mr. Truncer: Well, sort of in a circuitous way. I worked briefly for the National Park Service in Virginia, after I was out of college, I spent a year on active duty over in France with the military, and then I worked for the State of New Jersey for two years before I came here to Monmouth County.    Ms. Higgins: How old is the New Jersey Park System and the Monmouth County one?    Mr. Truncer: Well, New Jersey was one of the first states to become involved in preserving state forests, going back to slightly after the turn of the century. Most of the state land acquisition was during the 1920s and 1930s when there was interest and also funding, both state and federal. Monmouth County Parks System really started through the Monmouth County Planning Board studies and reports. Charlie Pike was then the County Planning Director, and as a result of his studies and reports, and the Planning Board's recommendation, the Board of Chosen Freeholders embarked on acquiring land in 1960 from the New Jersey Highway Authority at Shark River. That was really the first county park site, involving about twenty acres. That site was developed using county highway employees, the county engineers office, and county prisoners. Also, the Soil Conversation Service was doing work at that time creating farm ponds, and they created a small lake at Shark River. In 1961 the Board of Freeholders created, by resolution, the Board of Recreation Commissioners, which is a statutory board with seven members appointed for five year staggered terms. They receive no compensation, meet twice a month, and I serve as secretary to that board and also as the Director of the Park System. My first job with the county starting in 1964 was as a park planner. We had no park budget: part of the payroll was in the Planning Board, and part was in the Highway Department.    Ms. Higgins: How did you acquire land with no budget?    Mr. Truncer: Well, the Freeholders appropriated money specifically at that time to acquire the property at Shark River, and in 1962 the first Green Acres program was approved. A referendum was held statewide in 1961, which was passed by the electorate, and in 1962, funds became available to assist the county and municipalities in acquiring land. As a result of that program, lands were acquired at Holmdel, which is now Holmdel Park, as well as Turkey Swamp Park. So Shark River Park, Holmdel Park, and Turkey Swamp Park were the first three properties.    Ms. Higgins: What part of 1962? I don't remember what administration this was.    Mr. Truncer: Well, this would have been under Governor Richard Hughes.    Ms. Higgins: Was there federal money?    Mr. Truncer: Green Acres was state money, state bond issue money. Subsequent to that, federal money did become available through either the Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development's open space programs or through the Department of Interior's land and water conservation fund. Two distinct, separate programs, the Housing and Urban Development and Open Space Program, no longer exist at this time.  The land and water conservation fund has diminished significantly, but there's a movement at the present time to have it reinstated.    Ms. Higgins: I'm amazed that the park system is so young. I really am surprised that this has all been going on while we've been here in Monmouth County. It's so much progress you've made!    Mr. Truncer: Oh, yes. In 1961 we had something like eight employees, so in 1964 part of my first job was to create a budget, and to develop a program that was presented to the Freeholders, who ultimately provided funding, both capital funding and also an annual appropriation.    Ms. Higgins: I'm also, I must say, quite pleased to have been a real part of it as a Monmouth County taxpayer all these years. Did you find the public supportive as far as voting? What was the biggest disappointment?    Mr. Truncer: In 1964 many of the municipalities in Monmouth County were still rural  urbanization was limited to the eastern portions of the county. There was not a strong local commitment on the part of the local elected officials in support of the county program. However, subsequent votes on statewide Green Acres issues were always carried in Monmouth County  recently in 1986, the county had a referendum on the ballot to create a county open space programs funding with county dollars as well as using the state money. And each of those votes were issues passed by a large majority, so it's obvious that the people who live here today are very supportive of preserving open space and saving recreation areas as well as historic properties.    Ms. Higgins: What was your next job with the system?    Mr. Truncer: Well, after serving for a year as a planner, I was made director. I worked with a gentleman by the name of Walter Schoellner, who was a retiree who served as secretary to the board. We developed a plan for the Freeholders in terms of a long-range open space park plan. That led to several subsequent plans for the use of the county and state Green Acre funds. Also, I think, the other important fact is that a number of landowners in Monmouth County over the years have donated properties. We're sitting here at Thompson Park in the boardroom of the Administrative offices, which was Dr. Thompson's study. Mrs. Thompson, Dr. Thompson's mother, donated two hundred fourteen acres to the county upon her death. It was obvious that she felt strongly about the property, because she provided in her will that no additional houses are to be built on the property, that it be a bird sanctuary, and that if at all possible it be oriented towards children's activities. So here was a lady in her nineties, who in 1968 was far ahead of many people. I think as a result of her generosity others contributed properties over the years including Mrs. Elizabeth Durand and Miss Helen Herrmann, who was a very nice lady. Also, the Huber family donated properties in Middletown, so we've been very fortunate that citizens have come forward and made lands available to the public for the public's use and enjoyment.    Ms. Higgins: Was there a feeling in the 1960s that we must hurry and acquire this land due to the rapid development of the county?    Mr. Truncer: No, I think the planners, and a number of other people felt it was going to happen, predicted it was going to happen.     Ms. Higgins: I'm sorry, development or acquisition?    Mr. Truncer: Well, development was taking place. I'm thinking of people moving into the county and the population increase. But I think many of the elected officials didn't grasp what was about to happen, or believed it would happen. It wasn't until, in my opinion, until the late 1970s or 1980s that many of the elected officials realized what was happening  it was evident because the houses were there, the new subdivisions, the increased traffic, just the number of people who were suddenly here in Monmouth County.    Ms. Higgins: When did the park system acquire that huge success, the land for Seven Presidents Park?    Mr. Truncer: Well, that was an undertaking that really was started by the City of Long Branch as part of an urban renewal project, and the city came to the county asking if the county would take over the property and develop it for recreational use and as a beachfront operation, and we agreed to do that. It was with some difficulty that we did it over several city administrations. Ultimately, we were able to move forward, and we have acquired also some additional lands at the north end that we have added to Seven Presidents as additions to the original property that the city had assembled.    Ms. Higgins: Is it common for a county to have an oceanfront park?    Mr. Truncer: We're the only county in New Jersey that I'm aware of. In other states, such as South Carolina for instance, I know the counties have beach operations, but I'm not familiar with others.    Ms. Higgins: Is the park system involved in any kind of restoration of Asbury Park?    Mr. Truncer: We're not directly  we have been looking at acquiring lands in the Neptune and Asbury area for an urban venue, something different then we've done for other parts of the county. We're in the early stages of that at the present time. There is always a conflict in that the communities tend to think in terms of increased ratables. In renewal situations where they have lost ratable, their main emphasis is to put the property back on the tax rolls, so they're often reluctant to see additional properties go off the tax rolls for public use. And there are competing interests in terms of economic development, although we feel we have a role to play. One of the things we will be doing is encouraging the state redevelopment authority to be thinking also of open space and recreation.    Ms. Higgins: From what I've been reading and hearing, Long Branch has begun its own revival. Would you say that Seven Presidents Park is part of that?    Mr. Truncer: Well, I don't know to what degree, but there is no question that open space and good schools are attractive anchors in trying to stimulate development. Long Branch has been looking to develop the area between the Hilton Hotel and Seven Presidents Park, and that's what's being worked on at the present, as I understand it. And again, the city is looking at trying to put as much property back on the tax rolls as possible to generate revenue. It's a matter of a balance.    Ms. Higgins: Have you worked at the Rutgers Cooperative Extension at all?    Mr. Truncer: Well, we've had over the years a good working relationship with the county agent's office, also the soil conservation district. Back in the 1960s and 1970s those offices were oriented to the farm community which was much larger at that time, and had a number of programs which were helpful to us in providing services. We use Rutgers today in terms of their Agronomy Department. Also Rutgers provides short courses for our employees for our golf course maintenance and so on, and so we have an ongoing working relationship.    Ms. Higgins: The golf courses have been somewhat controversial. Would you comment on that?    Mr. Truncer: There's a sense that they may not be a necessity  I think that's one of the issues. Although in today's society, golf is a very popular sport and becoming more popular.    Ms. Higgins: You didn't get into any trouble with your tennis courts here at Thompson Park or over at Dorbrook. Why do you suppose golf was an issue?    Mr. Truncer: Cost. It's the cost involved and the perception that you're serving a limited number of people, although that has certainly changed in terms of golf as a lifetime activity, which is one of the things we try to promote. We like to be able to offer venues for people to try something. Without making major investments, they can decide if they find something that they would like to do for a lifetime or find rewarding and relaxing and part of their recreational life. Golf is one of those items, but we provide a number of other activities and introductions to activities that people can choose from.    Ms. Higgins: Like rock climbing.    Mr. Truncer: Rock climbing, or spelunking, or pottery and ceramics, or some of the fine arts, or hiking, camping, cross country skiing, downhill skiing, sailing, canoeing, kayaking -    Ms. Higgins: Where's the sailing?    Mr. Truncer: At the Manasquan Reservoir.    Ms. Higgins: They still have sailboats there?    Mr. Truncer: Yes. And we also do canoeing clinics, and kayaking, and there are rentals there for kayaks.    Ms. Higgins: When did the programs begin?     Mr. Truncer: In a very modest way, we started providing introductory programs in the late 1960s, early 1970s. Many of them were, and still are today, outdoor education, nature education series  both with the schools and outside the schools for groups.    Ms. Higgins: The snakes.    Mr. Truncer: The snakes, hikes, and gathering, and archeological programs also, and gathering of sharks teeth, and a variety of activities to introduce people to the world around them.    Ms. Higgins: When did you become director?    Mr. Truncer: Actually, I sat on the board here for a brief period of time, appointed by the Freeholders as a citizen, and then was hired and retained as a planner with the Planning Board to work on our park plan, and to put together our park organization, and then following that, I was appointed to the position of director. Then we implemented the plan that we had put together, and began the process of not only of acquiring lands and making them available to the public, but also of building a professional staff. We've been very fortunate in attracting highly qualified people, who do, in my opinion, an excellent job -  day in and day out. Our board of seven citizens over the years is very stable  we're on our fourth chairman in thirty-five years, to give you some indication of stability and interest. We also have citizens on the board who certainly are dedicated to developing and acquiring and making available open space to the citizens and providing recreational opportunities. Our role is to provide and set aside areas and develop facilities of countywide significance, as opposed to providing local and municipal programs. There's always some gray area that will overlap. But we try to serve more than one community in terms of looking at a region  we try to provide those things which aren't available at the community level. We see ourselves positioned between local services and the local service providers and the state, which provides things on a statewide basis.    Ms. Higgins: When you have properties which you can't immediately develop, how do you keep the trees and the vines from taking over what has already been cleared?    Mr. Truncer: It is difficult job, and we have on staff an individual who spends most of his time dealing with the problems associated with the management of our resources. He deals with invasive species, as a part of our resource management plan.    Ms. Higgins: What's an invasive species, besides poison ivy!?    Mr. Truncer: Well, that's a native plant. Most invasive species are introductions, plants that have been introduced, maybe well intentioned, maybe without much thought, but once they have been introduced they tend to displace native plant materials to the detriment of the native vegetation. One example which people don't give too much thought about, but which is and can be a problem, is the Norway Maple. The Norway Maple is an ornamental tree which has its place in the landscape, but it can cause problems  Russian Olive is a shrub-like plant that is prolific in moving into fields and crowding out other vegetation  these are two examples.    Ms. Higgins: What about locust trees?    Mr. Truncer: They're native. The two I think that people are most familiar with are Japanese Honeysuckle, which I think was introduced by the Soil Conservation Service as cover for soil stabilization for control of erosion, but of course, is now a vine that creeps over everything and is hard to eradicate. Another one is the Multiflora Rose, which the Cooperative Extension Service, USDA introduced as the living fence. The birds carry the seeds and this plant invades pastures and open lands, and can be very difficult to control.    Ms. Higgins: We keep fighting brambles, briar bushes.    Mr. Truncer: Some of those are native. Another one which is just at the northern limits, but is a problem or can be a problem south of us, is Kudzu. This is a vine which will actually cross highways if it wasn't for the fact that traffic runs over it.    Ms. Higgins: What does Kudzu do?    Mr. Truncer: It envelopes trees and literally chokes out sunlight from leaves of the trees that are supporting it  and it also runs along the ground. We have some in Monmouth County  there is enough winter kill that it doesn't become as prolific as it might. It has to regenerate itself in the spring and start over again, where in the South it just continues to grow year round.    Ms. Higgins: Does the Park System ever grow crops?    Mr. Truncer: Some of the open space areas that are set aside are currently as farmlands, so we have active farming operations on some of our land. The public still has access to these lands for hiking and nature study, and birding, but this is one of the ways we manage the lands to keep them open, where we would like to keep fields and not have them revert to forest. We want to keep that mix of field and forest.    Ms. Higgins: Farming is tough in Monmouth County nowadays.    Mr. Truncer: Very tough, and becoming tougher. But there have been shifts. Now we have the farm operations that are "pick your own," or that are much more intense operations where they are getting a higher yield per acre. Grain and, of course, potatoes commercially went out of the county back in 1986 and 1987.    Ms. Higgins: Potatoes? I interviewed a former potato farmer, Stanley Orr.    Mr. Truncer: We were one of the larger producing areas. As the crop would be harvested up from Florida, right up the East Coast, New Jersey was sort of in that market between the Del Mar peninsula and harvesting there and Long Island. We were in that window of about two weeks when the potatoes were harvested, and then the choices came after that. Farmers had to decide whether to store and hold their crop, which was always a problem, because farmers then had to compete with Maine, which harvests in the fall, in September, October, and Maine stored  they could store potatoes much better than we could locally.    Ms. Higgins: Also, Mr. Orr said that potatoes are not native to New Jersey, that they like the colder weather and they like hills. We are flat and a little too warm. On another subject, how do you reconcile here at the County Parks, the need to fertilize and the need not to fertilize?    Mr. Truncer: One of the things is what the pest management industry is moving toward. We have integrated programs of pest management and fertilization so that we're using less material, so that the material used does not move, it stays in place, so you're not getting it moving into bodies of water. As an example, on our golf course, we keep water and the materials that we use on site. This has a positive affect on the environment. So there have been changes, things are improving. It's been a matter of incorporating improvements in pest management and coming up with the best management practices.    Ms. Higgins: Do you have any comments on the county marina?     Mr. Truncer: We have a marina on the Raritan Bay, not too far from Port Monmouth, on Pew's Creek, which was acquired as we were acquiring lands for the Bayshore Regional Park. It's a facility that has been very successful, one that was acquired from a previous owner as part of a land acquisition and road relocation project. Over the years we have been increasing the amount of dockage, replacing docks, and expanding by providing additional bulkhead so we have both wet slips as well as rack storage.    Ms. Higgins: Can you put a boat in the water there?    Mr. Truncer: Yes. We use forklifts - we don't have a ramp as we do at the Manasquan Reservoir, but we can put a boat in the water for you with a forklift. People who rent rack storage space can just call ahead of time, say what time they'll be there, and the boat's in the water for them.    Ms. Higgins: Any sailboats?    Mr. Truncer: A few sailboats. Not for rental, but privately owned.    Ms. Higgins: Are they in rack storage?    Mr. Truncer: No, they're in their wet slip. There is a limit in terms of size that you can accommodate. But we've been upgrading the facility  we've increased the number of wet slips.    Ms. Higgins: How many do you have?    Mr. Truncer: One hundred and sixty seven.    Ms. Higgins: Wow! That's a lot, isn't it? That seems like a lot.    Mr. Truncer: No, it's not a lot if you compare to say Atlantic Highlands, one of the larger marinas in the state.    Ms. Higgins: There's been so much discussion about the Belford ferry. Would you please comment?    Mr. Truncer: We're not involved directly. We own lands that are in the vicinity, but we are not directly involved with the ferry. There's been discussion that as that facility is developed, the waterfront would be set aside for public access to the bay, and also to provide an opportunity for nature interpretation of the wet lands in that area.    Ms. Higgins: Is swimming a possibility? The water is getting cleaner, isn't it?    Mr. Truncer: We've got probably a little over a mile and a half of beachfront on the bay from Pew's Creek going toward Compton's Creek. You're correct  water quality has improved immensely over the past ten years. Of course we've been cleaning the beach regularly, and people enjoy fishing as well. The water is quite shallow, so I wouldn't say swimming is possible, but certainly wading and sunbathing, and using the beach are.    Ms. Higgins: I sometimes think the Monmouth County Park System is a victim of its own success. When you get a property and you begin a park there, there's a lot of comment: "Oh no, we don't want all that traffic." Well, certainly transportation and traffic in Monmouth County is a problem for everyone. People said Route 537 would get so much more traffic when you developed Dorbrook Park. Has that happened?    Mr. Truncer: No. There are three issues, no matter what the type of change of use happens to occur. They are concerns with regard to traffic, light, and noise. Adjoining property owners and people who live in the community express these concerns with regard to change. By and large, use that is at our facilities is over a period of time  within certain park areas use often peaks on weekends and holidays. Again, this depends on the type of activity the facility is providing. Other facilities, use is spread over a greater period of time. As an example, golf courses may have about three hundred individuals in the course of a day, which could be from five in the morning until ten at night. So you have four hours that an individual is actually there, four, four and a half, five hours maybe at the most, I think no more than that. So there's a turnover which is very slow. As some people leave, there are others who are arriving, and you don't get the same type of traffic pattern that you might get at a beach. At Seven Presidents on a nice Sunday, we might be closed by eleven or eleven thirty. And then by one thirty or two, some people will have left, and we will have people who come for the later part of the day. Noise, traffic and lights. I think there's always a concern in the community, if it's a parking lot, for example, will the lights be on? Will there be activities? If there are proposals for athletic fields, will the athletic fields be lit? Millstone Township has been going through difficult times in terms of where athletic fields might be located in their community, and if they are lit. Neighbors are complaining about the lights, and how long they are on, and so forth.    Ms. Higgins: I read in the paper not too long ago that there was a neighbor complaining about the airplane noise at Dorbrook.    Mr. Truncer: Yes. We provided the site for model airplane use.    Ms. Higgins: They need mufflers!    Mr. Truncer: Well, certainly the neighbor probably has a legitimate complaint. It's difficult  to find an area for that particular type of activity because you have a safety concern as well as noise concern.    Ms. Higgins: Could use rotate?    Mr. Truncer: Well, I think there are different ways it could be looked at. That particular use has been over the last fifteen years - or before that - the last twenty years, probably relocated three different times, and each time relocated because of complaints from adjoining property owners. As the county grows, and as there are more people in closer proximity, and closer to properties that we own, we're bound to have complaints, and part of our job is also to be a good neighbor. So we try to balance those things.    Ms. Higgins: On the water, you have the marina, and of course wonderful Seven Presidents  what's the status of the Fisher property in Locust?    Mr. Truncer: Well, that's one we have looked at acquiring -    Ms. Higgins: I thought you had.    Mr. Truncer: No, we haven't acquired it. It's one we have been talking with the owner and also attorneys for the owner, so hopefully someday that will be acquired. We have lands at Hartshorne woods that go down to the Navesink River at Rocky Point, lands that were originally part of a military installation.    Ms. Higgins: Off Portland Road?    Mr. Truncer: Off Portland Road, yes. We'll be doing an interpretation of that site. It was built in World War II as a coastal artillery installation. We have also acquired properties in Manasquan on the inlet called Fisherman's Cove. Locally, this preserves waterfront along the inlet as you come in past the bulkhead at the inlet, which we have also acquired as a natural area. These acquisitions will involve doing a plan at the present time for vegetative management. We want to revegetate it with native species. We have phragmites that have invaded it, also called Turkey Beards by some people because they are long, tall, and reed-like. These plants crowd out other, native species. So we're looking at developing and managing that site in terms of native species, both for access for the public to the waterfront, but also for doing nature interpretations. Manasquan Reservoir: we manage that facility which is state owned  we have a long-term management lease so we can develop facilities there. We are in the process of developing an outdoor education center, an environmental center at that location. We are acquiring lands among the major stream corridors, which includes the Manasquan River, and we have acquired probably ninety percent of the frontage along Cross Wicks Creek, between Ocean County and Mercer County, which adjoins Walnford and that historic site. We're acquiring lands along the Shark River  we've also acquired lands along the Swimming River Reservoir and some of the tributaries.    Ms. Higgins:  What is the relationship between Dorbrook Park and the Swimming River Reservoir?    Mr. Truncer: We actually own lands that adjoin the Reservoir  such as we do at Thompson Park. The water company, New Jersey American, actually owns the land immediately adjacent to the water, around the reservoir, and under the reservoir.    Ms. Higgins: Oh! Is that why you can't fish there?    Mr. Truncer: It's under the Water Company's control, but it is a tremendous resource that we hope someday will be available.    Ms. Higgins: What are the long range plans for the Park System?    Mr. Truncer: Well, we are still in the process of acquiring lands, both for open space and for recreational use. We presently have almost twelve thousand acres. Our long-range goal is at least nineteen to twenty thousand. We're in the process presently of assembling lands in the Perrineville area of Millstone for a regional park site.    Ms. Higgins: That area is growing so fast.    Mr. Truncer: Oh, it's developing very rapidly. And we have acquired Perrineville Lake, and we're in the process of actively acquiring properties in that area. We're also acquiring, as I mentioned, properties in Englishtown, at Clayton Park, along Crosswick's Creek, along Doctor's Creek, and doing greenway assemblages. We're looking at properties along Ramanessin Brook, which is a tributary to the Swimming River Reservoir  we've been acquiring lands on the North Branch of the Metedeconk, which is located in the Southern portion of Freehold and Howell Townships.    Ms. Higgins: Most of the land in eastern Monmouth County is pretty much spoken for by now, isn't it?    Mr. Truncer: There is very little left, in terms of any sizable property. The largest single remaining ownership is what was the former Haskell estate, "Woodland Farm," in Middletown. The current owner has not indicated what he plans to do with it  he has owned it for close to thirty years now.    Ms. Higgins: Isn't that where the Hunt took place?    Mr. Truncer: It used to be. The new owner no longer hosts the Hunt. They apparently couldn't work things out with the owner to continue the Hunt.    Ms. Higgins: Another victim of its own success.    Mr. Truncer: Well, I'm not sure. Apparently there didn't seem to be the same sense, or feeling toward the community that had been there with the previous owner.    Ms. Higgins: It used to be a wonderful family thing to do in the late 1950s and early 1960s.    Mr. Truncer: It was really a Monmouth County tradition. The site is a major property holding in the County. There are people I know who would like to see it preserved. Whether we will be successful someday, I don't know.    Ms. Higgins: Whose idea was it to put that path around Dorbrook? That's so wonderful.    Mr. Truncer: The paved trail. We're doing more of that type of trail in various locations. One of the things that, very frankly, trails provide is opportunity for a variety of users. I know you've said you and your husband have used it. And the fact is that you can have all ages use it. You can have youngsters learning how to ride a bicycle, to teenagers on rollerblades, to older citizens who just enjoy getting out and stretching and strolling and walking and doing their daily exercise. People have come to recognize that exercise is an important part of one's life and routine, and many of us who had become sedentary found out that isn't such a good idea. The fact is that there are more opportunities to exercise, and as more opportunities become available, people are now using them. It amazed me that the Henry Hudson Trail has been so well accepted in the Bayshore when the County acquired that. Complaints are minimal. We're now in the process of working with New Jersey Transit to reestablish the rail corridor as a trail from Matawan to Freehold, along the old rail bed. When that happens, it will offer an opportunity to walk or to ride a bicycle from Freehold all the way to Highlands, and eventually to Sandy Hook, and eventually to Sea Bright and down along the coast.    Ms. Higgins: I hear so many older people talk about how easy it was to get around the county on trains and trolleys, and we've let them all go, and now we're driving. Even as a person so instinctively opposed to paving, I'm happy you paved that trail.    Mr. Truncer: It isn't without debate, even internally, and even with professional staff. There are those who would like to see us sometimes leave things in a surface that you can ride horses on.    Ms. Higgins: Are there any plans for an equine county park?    Mr. Truncer: We are currently looking at plans to relocate our riding facility that is at Huber Woods, where we do riding programs for the handicapped as part of therapy, and recreational activity, to Sunnyside Recreation Area on Lincroft Middletown Road. We work with a non-profit organization called SPUR - Special People United to Ride - that has undertaken the funding and construction of an indoor riding facility and we have decided that since there isn't room for that type of facility at Huber Woods, we would accommodate it at the Sunnyside Recreation Area.    Ms. Higgins: Would it be limited to SPUR riders?    Mr. Truncer: Predominantly. Although we do provide lessons for the able bodied, and of course, people who are involved in the equestrian program feel that the indoor facility will allow them to do lessons during inclement weather and also it will extend the season when now lessons are either cancelled or curtailed because of weather. We're looking forward to that, and we also work with a Friends of the Parks, which is a non-profit organization that raises funds and takes on projects, whether it's improvements, or scholarships, or providing transportation services, and we also have a good working relationship with the Monmouth Conservation Foundation, which is a non-profit entity that acquires and holds lands for a municipality, or for the county. They've been very helpful in making things happen, particularly when time is of the essence. Government can't move as quickly as it would like to. These three organizations have been excellent supporters for the Park System.    Ms. Higgins: Would you tell us about the historic sites?    Mr. Truncer: As a part of our acquisition of properties we included Longstreet Farm, where we preserved the farmstead. Longstreet is a part of, and adjoins, Holmdel Park. And we set aside about eight acres of the original farm with the buildings and the house with the idea that we would do an interpretive and restoration to the turn of the century. We know that the County Historical Association buildings have been of revolutionary or pre-Revolutionary period in their restoration and their interpretation. We felt there was another story to be told in another different time period. So we've been working on the restoration of those buildings and the house over the years, and it's an ongoing program of protecting those buildings and also of developing interpretive programs introducing people to that time period. We have children's programs  we work with the schools in tying them into their classroom program. We also had a donation of a property and a mill at Walnford. Ed and Joanne Mullen donated the property and forty acres, and we've since been able to add to that. We now have the mill operating, we're in the process of finishing restoration on the outbuildings, and we're concluding the interior restoration on the house. We will open the interior of the house on October 1 of this year, not as a museum house, but for exhibits.    Ms. Higgins: How old is the house?    Mr. Truncer: This, as I recall, probably dates to 1774. It was the largest house in Monmouth County at the time. It was built over a period of a year and a half, and it was in existence at the time that the British and the Hessians came through on their evacuation of Philadelphia en route to Sandy Hook and the Bay.    Ms. Higgins: There are so many roads here that are named for mills. Tell us about the history of mills.    Mr. Truncer: They were a very important part of rural life. Walnford, and Walnsmill were really developed by the Waln family at an outpost as a point of commerce. The Walns were merchants out of Philadelphia, Quakers, and they shipped products from Walnford, down Crosswick's Creek to Bordentown and then down the Delaware. This, unfortunately, or more fortunately, I guess depending on your point of view, was not a success as a commercial venture, but they did have a number of other mills. In addition to the grist mill, they had a saw mill, and they had a foiling mill, and they had a smoke house. They shipped hams from Walnford to Philadelphia. They also had a post office, and they had a cooperage. There were a number of things happening in that site as well as people in residence, but it just never developed into a major point of commerce or grew as a community. Fortunately, the property remained in the Waln family for generations, and it was kept intact until we were fortunate enough to acquire it as a gift from the Mullen family. We also have acquired the Sea Brook Wilson house, or what locally was known as the Spy House, in Leonardo in Middletown, to which we will be doing structural work and restoration.    Ms. Higgins: Is that in cooperation with the local Historical Society?    Mr. Truncer: No, the property was conveyed to us by the Township, who was the owner, and we'll be using it as part of the Bayshore Park property as a visitor center and a point of contact. It is a very prominent structure as you approach the park and the bay. So we're looking at what we may be able to do with the structure in terms of restoring the outside fabric of the building, but also in adaptive use, so it has practical use.    Ms. Higgins: Is Monmouth County Park System the best county park system in the country?    Mr. Truncer: Well, we'd like to think so. It's sometimes very difficult to rate because there are larger systems in terms of acres and budget and employees. We like to think that one of the things we've been successful in doing is setting the standard for quality. Private golf courses compare themselves to our golf courses  country clubs compare themselves to us. Others compare themselves to us as to programs and program quality and content. So we like to try to set a high standard of quality for our maintenance. In terms of our overall plan for the County, we'd also like to think that we are setting a high standard. Certainly other parts of our country have excellent park systems. Some of them are much larger and doing a variety of things which we may not do. Again, we tend to be unique to the community where we're located. But I think that we have been fortunate because the citizens of Monmouth County have wanted us to provide quality and the Freeholders have been very supportive. I think this also goes for other county services. I've always felt that quality is important and needs to be a priority in what we do here in Monmouth County.    Ms. Higgins: If you had any advice that you would like to leave to people who will be hearing or reading this interview in fifty, seventy-five, or one hundred years, what kind of advice would you like to give?    Mr. Truncer: I guess I'd say that what happens today was thought about and was based on what somebody did twenty years ago, good and bad, and I think you have to think of that horizon of twenty plus years. If we don't, opportunities are lost, and it's a very difficult thing to do. People are accustomed to thinking in terms of their immediate needs and what's happening now, and not thinking in terms of what we need to do today to prepare for what may inevitably happen twenty years from now.    Ms. Higgins: Well, certainly our park system has had the benefit of your foresight, commitment, and expertise.    Mr. Truncer: You're very kind to say that, and I appreciate that, and I would again say that we have been very fortunate to have had support from our Freeholders who have really been interested in seeing these things happen. Without that support they just won't happen, and we all realize that. The other is our ability to attract and retain highly qualified professional people who certainly don't work here because of the salary, they work here because they want to do a good professional job, and that's been very beneficial to all of us.    Ms. Higgins: I thank you very, very much for the interview.    Mr. Truncer: Anytime.      
MonmouthCounty;James Perkins;1914;1999;James Perkins, 1914, 1999        Remembering The 20th Century: An Oral History of Monmouth County    Date of Interview: November 2, 1999  Name of Interviewer: June West      Premises of Interview: Power Lodge Senior Citizen Home, Wall, NJ  Birthdate of Subject: August 13, 1914    Ms. West: Mr. Perkins, could you tell me how old you are?    Mr. Perkins: I'm eighty-four. I was born on August 13, 1914.    Ms. West: Were you born here in Monmouth County?    Mr. Perkins: I was born in Gorham, Maine, a little town outside of Portland.    Ms. West: How old were you when you came to New Jersey?    Mr. Perkins: I imagine I was about three years old and my sister was two years old.    Ms. West: And how long have you lived in Monmouth County?    Mr. Perkins: I've been living in New Jersey for eighty-one years now. When we first came, it was to Ocean Grove, and then we went to Asbury Park and Manasquan.    Ms. West: Were educated down here?    Mr. Perkins: In Bradley Park School for my elementary grades for one year, then Belmar, and then High School.    Ms. West: When you left Maine, did you come to Asbury Park to live?    Mr. Perkins: Yes. Well, Ocean Grove first off, for a while. Then my father got a place in Bradley Park, which is part of Neptune I guess. I came down here I think to 10th Avenue, 128. It was just south of Corlies Avenue in Neptune, and he went to business in Asbury. He was a painting contractor and decorator, he did all the fancy work.     Ms. West: What school did you go to in Asbury Park?    Mr. Perkins: I went to Bradley Park.    Ms. West: Bradley Park what school?    Mr. Perkins: Bradley Park 10th Ave. I don't know what the name was.    Ms. West: That was grade school?    Mr. Perkins: Grade school, yes.    Ms. West: What high school did you go to?    Mr. Perkins: Manasquan High. I went one or two years at Belmar and then I think in the fifth grade I went to Manasquan Grammar, and then from there on I went on to high school.    Ms. West: Did you attend college after you graduated from high school?    Mr. Perkins: It was Monmouth Junior College.     Ms. West: How would you describe Monmouth County when you were a child? How were things then in relation to the way they are today?    Mr. Perkins: Oh, peaceful countryside, slower, you know, no racing around in cars. The old Model A Fords and all that stuff. Wagons and gravel roads. The water wagon would come around and spray the gravel streets. We kids used to run out and go in the water because we were kids. Then an old man with a monkey came around with a grinder begging for money.    Ms. West: What was he called?    Mr. Perkins: The monkey man, or an organ grinder. He would come around and beg for money.    Ms. West: What game did you say you liked to play as a kid, baseball?    Mr. Perkins: Baseball, yes. Of course you also had tag, and hide and seek, all that stuff you know.    Ms. West: Hobbies, what about hobbies?    Mr. Perkins: I like to draw. I've done paintings or local rivers and ships mostly.    Ms. West: Do you do any of that now?    Mr. Perkins: Not lately, but I have done some not too long ago.    Ms. West: You mentioned you were married  do you have any children?    Mr. Perkins: One girl. I didn't get married until I was thirty-five because I was helping my mother, and my wife was helping her folks, too. My stepfather died, and I had to help out.    Ms. West: Now you were born in 1914. Who was president when you were born?    Mr. Perkins: I don't know. It seems like it might be Roosevelt, the other Roosevelt, not FDR, but Theodore.    Ms. West: Was your father in World War I?    Mr. Perkins: No, but he was liable for either country because he was born in Canada, but he's of American parents, so he was liable for here and for Canada. He was in the Maine militia. After the war, he was Head Guard for the Morgan Ammunition plant. We moved just away from there before it blew up. He said it's going to be hell because men would go around with cigarettes and all and he was afraid of something. And the house that we lived in, there's nothing left of it but the chimney. That was in Morgan, New Jersey, outside of Amboy.    Ms. West: You say you spent most of your life here in Monmouth County.     Mr. Perkins: My mother was still an Alger  they had a lot of land in Wall Township. They had this big farm here and part of it was Fort Evans.    Ms. West: That was part of your mother's land.    Mr. Perkins: The grandparents more than that back to James Alger. When somebody died, they'd give each one the property. And now on 18th Ave. there's houses being built there called Old Mill Pines Village, that's part of it.    Ms. West: You mentioned your hobby. Do you have any heroes?    Mr. Perkins: I never thought much about it, because I like all people different ones. Of course, Babe Ruth...    Ms. West: You were a Yankee fan?    Mr. Perkins: Yes.    Ms. West: Are you still a Yankee fan?    Mr. Perkins: Yes, more or less. I don't go much for sports anymore.    Ms. West: You didn't watch the World Series on television then, did you?    Mr. Perkins: Well, the way I worked I never had a chance to follow them through. I worked nights in the post office and then when I got in working for the lumber company. I worked for two lumber companies and the last one was Linden Lumber. I'd work three nights a week till nine o'clock. That was a good job.    Ms. West: What would you describe is your most important legacy to your family, friends, and society?    Mr. Perkins: I never thought of that.    Ms. West: What concerns you most in the world about the world today?    Mr. Perkins: There's too many militants, for one thing. Wars are everywhere and fighting and people not getting along. I think people should get to know each other better and be better.    Ms. West: Well, what part of your life would you like to relive, if you'd like to relive a part of it?    Mr. Perkins: Oh, I don't know. All of it was pretty good. It was hard and everything. I had all kinds of challenges as a kid. Newspaper route and working in markets and so. Like one job: I had the owners of Shop Rite before Shop Rite was made  I worked for a dollar a day. They had me chopping wood, polishing the car, waiting on people, sweeping the store, and cleaning chickens.    Ms. West: But a dollar a day was good money back then, wasn't it?    Mr. Perkins: Yes. It went up to two dollars a day later on, and I had one summer I worked for two dollars a day and two dollars a night. I had a job for a tinsman in the daytime, working on roofs, tin roofs and then slate roofs and gutters. And at night, I had a vegetable market, so when the trucks came in I would have to help unload and fix the counters and wait on people that came in. I didn't fall off the roof. In fact, one time, we were painting a shingle roof staining it with red stain, and the man up above me on the ladder kicked the bucket over. It spilled all over me. I had my fake skin for about three weeks.    Ms. West: Oh, my heavens! What location in Monmouth County means the most to you? Is there any particular area in the county?    Mr. Perkins: I like it right where we are. My father lived with his brother for a while in Spring Lake Heights, I think it's nice over there.    Ms. West: Well, you say you also lived in Spring Lake Heights.    Mr. Perkins:  I lived across from the golf course and I got a job caddying there. That was the best job I had when I was a kid.    Ms. West: And so you went to Monmouth Junior College.    Mr. Perkins: I drew the first school shield.    Ms. West: You made a what?    Mr. Perkins: The emblem for the school.    Ms. West: You made that?    Mr. Perkins: The first one, not this one now. It was like a fan with a torch and so forth.    Ms. West: What was it supposed to symbolize?    Mr. Perkins: Well, education, you know  study and industry.    Ms. West: And what year was that?    Mr. Perkins: 1935. They used it on the school paper in the front and for different things.    Ms. West: If you could choose a symbol for your life what would it be?    Mr. Perkins: I don't know. What do you mean by symbol?    Ms. West: You said you've made a torch. You could be a torch. You can light up the world.    Mr. Perkins: Oh, I never thought of myself as a leader, but I'd like to have been a writer, an artist. I'd like to have done a little of both.    Ms. West: You wrote songs, played a little music. You said you drew a lot.    Mr. Perkins: I've done a lot of art, and I've given it away.    Ms. West: What has been your greatest achievement in life?    Mr. Perkins: Well, family, I suppose, mostly.    Ms. West: You said you have a daughter. Do you have any grandchildren?    Mr. Perkins: Two boys, yes. And they're doing well. One graduated from Junior College, and he's got a job with IBM, and the other one is still in school and he's doing well in music. He has a guitar and he plays at social affairs, churches, and everything. He was in one contest down there in Florida where they had eighteen baby grand pianos playing at once and he was only sixteen years old. I've been able to get a house of my own even now I'm here for about $400 dollars a month I believe.    Ms. West: How long have you been at Tower Lodge Senior Citizen Home?    Mr. Perkins: About eight or nine months.    Ms. West: Oh, you just came here.    Mr. Perkins: Yes. Soon I'll have to sell my house or something, probably. I don't want to tie myself down in a place like this. I want to be free. If I can only walk again, I'll get around.    Ms. West: What happened?    Mr. Perkins: I fell and broke my hips. This leg was bad. I could walk, and nobody knew I was crippled, because my feet were out straight and all, and now it goes like this, like a Z. It's hooked up wrong with my hip some way. I'm in pain all the time. Same with here. I don't know what he put on here. It made a big bulge here, and my foot goes like that  see how it's sideways. I'm walking like on my instep. The knee doctor says I need a new hip operation. That means new legs too. I don't know.    Ms. West:  What are your favorite TV programs, or do you have any?    Mr. Perkins: Well, I don't watch too much. I like the news. I like Matlock and I Love Lucy. My wife likes Jeopardy. I like Wheel of Fortune. Of course, the news.    Ms. West: Do you ever listen to the radio now?    Mr. Perkins: My roomate has a TV, but I have a little radio, and I like the music. I like WJLK. I like the Asbury News.    Ms. West: What would you say is the most unusual thing about yourself?    Mr. Perkins: I don't know. Well I never pushed myself. I just go along if people like me. That's why I may never be a leader I guess.    Ms. West: What are your deepest values?    Mr. Perkins: Family values are important: honesty, and being liked.    Ms. West: And what are your personal strengths?    Mr. Perkins: Not very much now, I'm about half dead from my hips down  I'm no good at all.    Ms. West: Your mind.    Mr. Perkins: What good is that if you can't move around?    Ms. West: Well, you and I are speaking now: the wisdom and the knowledge that you can pass off to me. You don't have to walk to tell me that. I mean you've seen a lot of changes in your lifetime.    Mr. Perkins: I've always been active. Of course I had to be. When I was a kid, I worked when I should've been playing.    Ms. West: What are some of the changes that you've seen in your lifetime?    Mr. Perkins: It's hard to say. Let me think. I think people are getting wiser and maybe a little more considerate of one another, I hope. Like you see in here, the Blacks and the Whites get along good in here. It's silly some of the stuff the way people at work act.    Ms. West: You mentioned that people get along here. That's fine. What advice would you give to young people today?    Mr. Perkins: My daughter taught her two sons to get their education. Study, and it will make it easier for them later on. I could've used some of that advice too, because I didn't study as hard as I should have. But I made out pretty good. I graduated from high school with 117 and half points. I only needed eighty-four, but that's because I was taking two courses, commercial and college, because of journalism, typing, and commercial law.    Ms. West: You said journalism was your major in college?    Mr. Perkins: High school. And college more or less was on my mind, but when I got out, it was right at the Depression and I couldn't afford to go. I had two chances: to go to West Point, which I'm sorry I didn't try, but I wasn't good in math and algebra and all that, and I didn't have any calculus and all that. I went to college at a Junior College and I took up mathematics. I shouldn't have taken the advanced two weeks course, I should've pulled out of it, but I didn't. It was over my head.    Ms. West: So your working life you spent pretty much with the post office and the insurance company.    Mr. Perkins: And the lumber companies. I spent over twenty years in the last lumber company, and I've been retired for over twenty years.    Ms. West: How many years were you with the post office?    Mr. Perkins: Fifteen.    Ms. West: What are your feelings as we enter the new millennium? There's not many days left in the 20th century, you know. Did you ever think that you would live to see the turn of the century?    Mr. Perkins: No, I never thought I would live to be eighty-four years old. Since I was sick, and you know, weak. But I did heavy work in the lumber company. I had muscles. I did a lot of repair to my house. I like carpentry.    Ms. West: Did you go to the movies on Saturdays and watch the serials and all?    Mr. Perkins: When I was in Belmar School we used to go river there and behind the river they'd drop the tickets. We'd pick up the used tickets no matter what color they were, and the usher was in the dark, and we passed them to him. We went for nothing, and on Saturdays you could go for ten cents anyway.    Ms. West: Kids are always amazing. Always trying to find a way. Okay if you could describe your life as a road map how would it be? Smooth, rocky, rough, sort of in between?    Mr. Perkins: Sort of in between. It was rough at times. But I was lucky. I married a good woman and we made out pretty good. She was willing to go anywhere  she didn't want everything at once. I didn't know about her family history until after we married and we went on a wedding trip and went to her people in Georgia. We went to see this old cousin, and she gave us a map of the family genealogy. Mary Clay, who was the Third Post Master General and the Third Attorney General in the United States was her ancestor, and she was related to President Monroe. Alice Roosevelt's daughter had married into Mrs. Perkin's family, people named Longsworth, and we got some of the Longsworth's silver. So there are relatives there. There are some very interesting people in our family, some famous people, too.    Ms. West: Oh, that's interesting.    Mr. Perkins: Songwriter Johnny Mercer's aunt, Caroline Klide, was also my father in law's cousin.    Ms. West: Really! Oh, so you were rubbing shoulders with Piggy Lee.    Mr. Perkins: My wife's first husband, Joe, went to Wilmington  they thought I used politics to go down there but I went on my own. But I just remember that her cousin was counselor of Delaware, and her uncle was a city clerk.    Ms. West: Did you ever get involved in politics?    Mr. Perkins: No. I wouldn't say I was. I was in the Eagle Lodge and I was a recording secretary and then I became the grand master of The Eagle Lodge in New Jersey.    Ms. West: In what lodge?    Mr. Perkins: Nights of the Golden Eagle and I could be in the lodge in Pennsylvania but I refused it.    Ms. West: Okay. Is there anything else you want to tell me?    Mr. Perkins: I don't know of anything. Except I knew my mother had these relatives that she could've gone to for help. The president of the bank in Belmar had land right next to us on the farm. He was head of the bank, different ones.    Ms. West: I know you can't walk, but there are lots of things you need your mind for  you don't always use your legs for everything. So do you feel that there is still something that you would like to accomplish?    Mr. Perkins: With all these songs that God gave me, I'd like to get someone to make a tape of maybe ten or twelve songs on it and give it to someone to play them.    Ms. West: A tape of what?    Mr. Perkins: Music.    Ms. West: You want to write some more music.    Mr. Perkins: I did write a couple of new songs recently. They're religious ones, and I wrote the words in about ten minutes. It just seemed like God gave it to me. And I would never want to make any money on them. In fact, I gave one of them away, I had not completed it yet, I gave the song. I want to give them the copyright.    Ms. West: What's your religious affiliation?s    Mr. Perkins: I'm Protestant, but it's a mixture with Catholic, too.    Ms. West: So the song is just a universal type song.    Mr. Perkins: Yes. The idea is that the business of Christ coming down earth for us, Savior of our sin. And I wrote, "Thank You, Blessed Savior," and the other one was I Find the "Old Rugged Cross." I emphasize that blood and the cross.... (Singing) "My Jesus crawled his way to Calvary." That's all. I haven't got a copyright. The other one's copyright is "Thank You for the Blessed Savior." (Singing) I thank you for my family, my friends and neighbors, too. I thank you for my health and wealth of days on earth lived through. I thank you for the birds and trees, spring flowers, fruit, and grain. All bounties on this life I lived till you come back again. Oh thank you blessed Savior for your guidance and your love, for coming down alive from above. To tell us of that Heaven, and your Father who sent you, to save us all from Hell for life anew. In everlasting heaven, oh, thank you blessed Savior and your hallowed fellow too. How gratefully I'll live my life for you.    Ms. West: And you wrote that. How nice.    Mr. Perkins: If you turn it off, I'll sing the other one.    Ms. West: Why must I turn it off?    Mr. Perkins: Because I don't want to share my copyright.    Ms. West: Okay. Then at this point, I say thank you for letting me speak with you this afternoon. We really appreciate it and now I will turn it off so you can sing me the song.
MonmouthCounty;Iola Caplan;1925;2000;Iola Caplan, 1925, 2000            Remembering The 20th Century: An Oral History of Monmouth County  Iola Caplan  Iola Caplan      Date of Interview: February 23, 2000  Name of Interviewer: Ms. Newman  Premises of Interview: Ocean Township, NJ  Birthdate of subject: August 12, 1925    Ms. Newman: From  1968 to 1972 Mrs. Caplan was affiliated with the Madison Township Board of Education and from 1972 to 1989 she held a position of social worker on the Child Study Team at Henry Hudson Regional High School District. Mrs. Caplan, how did you first came to this area?  Iola Caplan, 1949  Iola Caplan after a full day of hiking the Judean Hills in Israel, 1949    Ms. Caplan: I was raised in Chatham Township in Morris County, and as a teenager I moved to Newark. I graduated from Arts High School in Newark, New Jersey in June, 1942. And then I entered New York University. I commuted from Newark everyday for four years and graduated from NYU with a major in music education in May or June of 1946. After that I began teaching music in New York City in Jewish afternoon schools. Then I taught in a Jewish day school, the Ramaz School, in New York for two years in the late  1940s. I guess I was at Ramaz from 1947 to 1949. In 1949, I received a scholarship to spend one year in the newly born State of Israel, so from 1949 to 1950, I was in Israel. I was in a youth leadership training course there. It was an intensive course which included, among other courses, participating in music education activities throughout the new country, meeting with teachers and learning the folk music and so on. When I came back in 1950, I had forfeited my tenure year at Ramaz, so I got a music teaching job in Detroit, Michigan in 1951. That's where I met my husband, Philip Caplan. He was born and raised in Detroit, and his family dates back to the 1880s in the city of Detroit. He had just graduated as a physicist, and he was able to secure employment at Fort Monmouth which was then the Signal Corps Engineering Laboratories at Fort Monmouth and at Camp Evans (now being converted to a historical site). His first job was at Camp Evans with the Diana Project, the moon project. And not being people who moved around very much, we landed here and stayed here. We were married in the summer of 1952 and we stayed here in Asbury Park. We're still right here. We haven't moved very far. I had an encounter with Asbury Park when I was a teenager living in Newark. I belonged to what was then called the National Youth Administration or the NYA Symphony Orchestra. This was during my junior and senior years in high school.    Ms. Newman: What was your instrument?    Ms. Caplan: Violin. We had some outstanding conductors in those days. The musicians and the artists and the conductors didn't have means to make a living, so the government created work projects under the New Deal. One of them was a youth orchestra. We gave concerts in the summertime for one entire summer. I forget which year it was  it was in Asbury Park at Convention Hall. Coming from a rather poor neighborhood  in Newark, coming down here on a Saturday was just like coming to heaven. Asbury Park was just beautiful with the gardens, the layout of the lakes, the water, the boats, and the people.  I believe this was 1940, was just about the time of the war. I think it was 1940 or 1941 that I was in that orchestra. And never thinking that years later I would end up here because my husband secured a job at Fort Monmouth by chance. When he came here, there were already about thousand engineers and scientists employed by the Signal Corps Laboratories, and so we settled here as a young couple.  I had given up my job in Detroit and he was just starting to work. My mother was very ill at the time, and my dad was not working. So here we were, moving down to Asbury Park and as we didn't have any means, we rented a room with kitchen privileges in Bradley Beach on McCabe Avenue. It was not a very ideal honeymoon situation, but I think we were paying thirty-five dollars a month rent. It was about what we could afford, and that was good, and we stayed there three months. As I began to become acquainted with the community, I particularly sought out Hadassah and Jewish organizations. I think the first person I met in the Jewish community here was Sylvia Meistrich, who is still living in Florida  most of her generation is gone. She immediately introduced me to Marion Cohn, who just moved down to Florida. Marion and Harold lived on 4th Avenue in Asbury Park, raised their children there, and then moved to West Deal.  Marion is a musician and a piano teacher. When she was pregnant with her first child, she was conducting the Shore Area Hadassah Choral in Bradley Beach. She needed somebody to take over, and since that was my field, I began to conduct the Hadassah Women's Choral Group. We used to meet at the Congregation Sons of Israel in Asbury Park, which was considered the largest and most important congregation in the shore area at that time. All the towns along the shore had small Jewish congregations, and still have, to a certain extent, but the Asbury Park Congregation is now gone. But at that time, it was the center of the Jewish Community here. So I conducted a choral group  most of the women in my chorus were from Bradley Beach. In fact, one of the last of them, Dottie Bernstein, passed away just a couple of years ago. Dottie had a gorgeous voice and she was my soloist. And I could go into the details of the people if you are interested in names.    Ms. Newman: Were you in great demand by virtue of the fact that you had been in Israel? Was that so unusual that you spoke to local groups about it?    Sylvia and Hy Pardes (left) with Philip and Iola Caplan during lunch near Ashkelon on the Mediterranean    Ms. Caplan: Yes, yes. I did a lot for local groups. I was a program chairman for Hadassah for many years, and we used to put on programs based on Israeli songs and the folk dances, and I was kind of a culture resource here for Hadassah for a long time. I never desired to become President of the Organization or anything like that, but I was a good consultant and resource. I was active, and I was also active in the Sisterhood of Sons of Israel. My husband was active in the Synagogue for many years, too. I don't know what you call it in English  he was like a sexton, I guess. Before we had our children, we were immediately volunteered to conduct groups on Saturday afternoons for the children who were affiliated with the Synagogue and the community, and we were a resource for Jewish culture and Israel, and so on.    Ms. Newman: How long did you live in a furnished room in Bradley Beach?     Ms. Caplan: After three months, we moved to Asbury Park.  We graduated to 7th Ave. in Asbury Park. The owner of our house was  -- I don't remember her husband's name, but her name was Fan Golden, and she was in the choir at Temple Bethel, which was across the street on Asbury Ave. Her husband owned that building  it was an old, very large single family home that had been converted, as many of them were in those days, to apartments for the income. She lived in Allenhurst in a big mansion, and so we got a rear apartment, and lo and behold, that apartment actually had a kitchen. It looked like a closet. We stayed there until I became pregnant. We must have stayed there about two years, because our child wasn't born until 1955. When I was about to give birth to Hannah we moved to Sixth Avenue to a second floor apartment in a house that was owned by the Edelstein family. He was a lawyer here. It is an old family, Edelstein. That apartment had a big bedroom and a big living room and a kitchen you couldn't sit in, but it had sunlight, and we lived there until I was about to give birth to my son. My daughter was born in 1955 and Benjy was born in 1956. I had four children in four and a half years, so at that point there was no room for two babies. So we moved to the West Side of town which was then uptown. The people who were "real" residents of Asbury Park lived on the Northwest side. My dad, who was from North Jersey, was a carpenter and we couldn't afford to buy. A lot of people were buying housing in Wanamassa even in those days, trying to get into developments and things like that. We preferred to stay not far from the Synagogue and also to stay in the community, and we really couldn't afford to buy anything, because I wasn't working at that time, only my husband was working at Fort Monmouth. I did work part time  I was a music teacher when I was pregnant with Hannah. I taught music at the Lakewood Hebrew  Day School, a Yeshiva which still exists. I did a little activity but I wasn't getting any income. So my dad came along, and he took this house which was on Fifth Avenue where Fifth Avenue and Locust Drive meet. There's a little park across the street  it's like a triangle. The house was tipped over to one side... these old houses list, but this one was so listed that it was just about condemned. It had been a house that raised a whole family of Asbury Park residents. One man who raised his family there -- I think his name was Heckman -- was a math teacher at Asbury Park High School. He was the one who sold us that house. When we bought it he had retired and his children were all grown, and we bought that house, I believe, for $10,000. We didn't have any money to have builders come, but we did get an architect. We figured we'd better divide this big house into two apartments so that we could sustain it. My dad raised that house by himself -- literally by himself -- with no help -- little by little until it became level. I bet it's still level. I've seen it. We remodeled the kitchen. People were remodeling kitchens. And we lived in the downstairs apartment with a living room, but no dining room. The dining room had been turned into a bedroom. We had two bedrooms and then in the back hall there was a little tiny room  we built a little bathroom next to it. So we had the third bedroom  you know we were having children. And then in the back hall, the back entrance became a bedroom for our son Benjy, who was born in the 1956. Benjy now has been living in Israel for twenty-five years. We have three grandchildren in Jerusalem. We had four children altogether and we stayed in that house until the last child was born    Ms. Newman: What are the others' names?     Ms. Caplan: Hannah and Benjy and Joshua and Jonathan. Three boys and a girl. I could tell you how come we had the children so fast, but that wouldn't be for publication. We wanted children   we were both only children. We didn't realize what was involved. We wanted to make up for the fact that we were both only children. We wanted descendants. Hannah and Benjy and Josh and Jonathan  were all early students at the Hillel School in Wanamassa. Hannah was in the first kindergarten in the Logan Road building, which was the first building. The Hillel School started at the Jewish Community Center in Asbury Park, Comstock Street, west of the railroad. There was a frame building that was the Jewish Community Center and that's where they started the Hilo school. They were renting that space. And then they had to get out of there because that building was razed and a senior citizens home was built there between First and Asbury Ave. The Hillel school was moved with the help of the city of Asbury Park to the Solarium on the Boardwalk at First Ave. It was there for several months. They had to put up sheet rock and partitions at The Solarium to form classrooms. The new school was being built on Logan Road and Park Blvd. in Wanamassa. It is still there. And so all four of our children attended elementary school at Hillel and all four children went on to Ocean Township High School.       Ms. Newman: You had said that when you came here as a school girl you thought Asbury Park was the most beautiful place you'd seen. Did it live up to your expectations when you actually moved here?    Ms. Caplan: Oh, yes, yes. We moved here about ten years later, and it was like a dream. Philip at the time was looking for jobs in Detroit. He was just out of school. Then this one in Monmouth County just came up. It was the only place he could get a job at the time and we needed him to get a job at that point. It was like a dream that we were going to come down to this paradise of Asbury Park. We came down here to look around and it was just marvelous. We spent much of our first two years walking the boardwalk, eating lunch by the ocean out there, picnicking. We just drank in the beautiful environment  we couldn't believe where we were, and we still love it. We still walk the Boardwalk whenever we have a chance. What can I tell you about Asbury Park? I'm sure that all of this has been recorded: the Boardwalk was in tiptop shape and it was always crowded. On Saturday nights we always used to  go for a walk on the Boardwalk. We'd keep the Sabbath so we were at home during the day. It was hot and we had no air conditioning. Believe it or not, the kids grew up without air conditioning and we had heat waves then that were equivalent to what we have now, but people managed somehow.    Ms. Newman: You lived to tell the tale.    Ms. Caplan: Yes, we lived to tell the tale. And we had some very cold winters. I remember ice skating and taking the kids for ice skating on Sunset Lake  hundreds of people there in the cold winters. We haven't had so many winters where you could ice-skate, but in those days there were several in a row.  I guess it was in the 1950s when we had really heavy snow. There were some storms! I remember when Josh was born. He was born January 6, 1958  there was a terrible storm that night  it was eight to ten inches of snow. It was so bad that you couldn't go visit patients at Jersey Shore Medical Center. At that time it was called Fitkin Hospital. Hannah was born in Monmouth Medical and the rest of the kids were born over here at Fitkin Hospital. I can still see my room in the old building. The older children came to wave at me from the lawn below.  You know children were not allowed to come into the hospital at that time, and we had little ones. When Benjy was born, Hannah was only fifteen months old. They would bring the children to the grass below to look up to the window.  You know,  we couldn't show them the new baby, because the baby was in the nursery and there was crying and all that stuff. And you know we had circumcisions for the boys. Nowadays the circumcision event is almost the size of a wedding. In those days, the Banker family, which had owned Banker Furniture Store, dedicated a room at Fitkin Hospital for circumcisions. A nice little room was all equipped. In those days, of course, mothers stayed at least seven days in the hospital. I mean we weren't allowed to move around or do anything like that. So we had two circumcisions at Fitkin Hospital. When we had the third one, I said, "No more at the hospital,"  because in those days after the circumcision, the baby  would be put in isolation, because they worried a lot about infection. I mean nobody could come in, nobody could go out. Nowadays the family comes in and the kids come in. I said, "No more babies over night in the nursery isolated by themselves where I can't reach them." So we had the third circumcision on the youngest child  at the rebuilt home on 1302 Fifth Avenue. Incidentally, the second apartment was 510 Sixth Avenue and the first one was one Seventh Avenue.    Ms. Newman: But it was in the neighborhood.    Ms. Caplan: The first one was near the ocean on Seventh Ave. and the second one was a little closer to Grand and the third was on the west side all the way up here, near Wanamassa where Bridge Street is. It wasn't Bridge and Fifth.    Ms. Newman: How long did you stay there?    Ms. Caplan: We stayed there until Hannah was eleven. We stayed there about ten or eleven years and from there, in 1965, I entered graduate school. This might tie into some of the social trends of the 1950s and the 1960s. You've probably heard of the Feminine Mystique by Betty Friedan. I was kind of weary then, you know, with four kids in a row, and working very hard at that. I borrowed the Friedan book from the library. I had graduated in 1946 from New York University and I had been a teacher for three years before I went to Israel, and then I had taught part time after that. I just felt that I needed to do something, and this book said, "Hey, you're allowed to do it  it's okay, you know." But I chose something very, very difficult at that time: graduate school. There was no part time program for graduate students in the Rutgers Graduate School of Social  Work. There was no such thing. Now all the schools have part time programs. So I, in a sense, was a pioneer, as were one or two of my colleagues from various other parts of Monmouth County.    Ms. Newman: What made you chose social work?    Ms. Caplan: Okay, here's the interesting story. When I read that book, I said, "I have to get out," and at least I had been busy with volunteering and organizations, and  doing whatever I could in the community to get myself out of the house a little bit in the evening, now and then. But I wanted to do something with what I was trained to do: something professional. I said, "I'm going to take a course at Neptune High School." I heard that Newark State College offered courses at Neptune High School in the evenings. I looked at the curriculum, and at one course  called The Family, and wow, that was right up my alley,  at that time. And I went and I took that course. I think it met once a week for one semester. The teacher happened to be somebody who was the Head Social Worker at Marlboro State Hospital  I guess he was teaching a course to get away from it all. I became intrigued, and of course he needed volunteers over there. This was when Jonathan was in nursery school. He was the only one who ever went to nursery school. Everybody else was at home until kindergarten. I figured he's in nursery school, maybe I could get out a few hours twice a week in the morning or whatever it was, I don't remember, maybe three times a week. I used this time to go to Marlboro State Hospital. Well, Marlboro was a place that never had the staff that it needed, and certainly not social work department staff, and this is why this teacher recruited me. I think Marlboro is one of the three or the four state hospitals for the mentally ill. It was just closed, but there's one down in Angora, and there's one up in Greystone Park, and there's another one maybe somewhere in Bergen County. They are distributed throughout the state according to counties. Marlboro was a regional hospital for the mentally ill. Now this was the time when there was a great change in the way the mentally ill were processed and treated. This man who was the Head of the Social Work Department was involved in something called deinstitutionalization, a project they started to get the patients out into the community. They were established in boarding homes. They started to establish these boarding homes, especially in Long Branch and Asbury Park  most especially in Asbury Park because there were so many large homes.    Ms. Newman: Half way houses.    Ms. Caplan: They really weren't half way houses. Half way houses are more for drug addiction or parolees. These were just shelters, custodial care places. The philosophy behind this was to get the patients out of the hospital and into the community, to get them in a family kind of home.    Ms. Newman: And did these homes have social residents, social workers, or visitors?    Ms. Caplan: Social workers, due to large caseloads, visited only infrequently. Medications were loosely monitored, and the ideal of integration into the community didn't or couldn't happen. The project turned out to be a disaster for the city and for the people involved. I'm not going to be a social critic here, but that's one of the things that led to the downfall of the City of Asbury Park. Because they had these wonderful big houses that could be converted into homes for these recently released mental patients. Also,  people were moving out of Asbury Park because of the race riots. Because of the riots and because of the tensions, people started to move out of Asbury Park. As these homes were being vacated, the hospitals started to send these people out for family care, and that's a whole chapter.    Ms. Newman: When you went to Marlboro as a volunteer, what was your experience there?    Ms. Caplan: I had zero experience in social work, and in order to go to graduate school, I would have to have some social work experience. So here was my big opportunity. For three months or four months I volunteered there. They needed somebody to do the intake as the people were being brought in with the First Aid Squads and so on. There was no professional to greet them and to get some basic information  there were separate men's and women's intake departments. I was put in charge of women's intake for a few hours a week with little or no supervision.    Ms. Newman: This was in an area where you had no experience.    Ms. Caplan: Absolutely none.    Ms. Newman: Were you shocked at conditions?    Ms. Caplan: I certainly was. I was more than shocked, I was traumatized, but I plugged on. I'm a person who takes a challenge sometimes in a stupid way. I don't want to say stupid, but I don't give up easily. I had a wealth of experience there. I can say that what I had there was a richer experience in social work and social problems than I had subsequently in two years of graduate school with field placements and in any of my career work with the mentally ill. I had a lot of compassion and still do. You really have to go to graduate school to learn how to not get burned out. Here I had four children at home. I do give my husband a lot of credit because he tolerated all this, and he did the best he could to support what I was trying to do. I think my in-laws in Detroit and my parents must have had many sleepless nights, but we persevered. So for a half a year I was at Marlboro, and then I still needed a half a year training to enter graduate school, so I worked part time for the Monmouth County Welfare Board and that was also a very rich kind of training. I went on monthly home visits to welfare recipients. I was exposed to all the aspects of the welfare system and to the poverty in Monmouth County. I mean I had come from poverty: we had never been upper class or even middle class until post World War II, but the poverty that I saw at that time in Monmouth County was just traumatizing. It was in places out in Freehold Township among the migrant workers, and among many  African Americans. It was an education. For the six months that I worked for the Monmouth County Welfare Board, I was exposed to the bureaucratic system of social welfare agencies, and that was an entirely new area for me. I was a music teacher and had experienced quite a bit of frustration with bureaucracy doing that. But when you come in and see people hurting and suffering, and you feel helpless  that's the beginning experience with social work. So then you go to school for two years, and  you're supposed to take these two years consecutively, so I should have graduated in 1967. But between those two years, my mother became terminally ill. We were still on Fifth Avenue, and by that time the apartment upstairs was vacated. We brought Mother into the apartment apartment just when I had finished my first year of graduate school, which in itself was something unbelievable, something unbelievable, for a full time mother of four children. There's another woman, who's name I might mention, who was for many years the Dean of Community Education at Brookdale. She was in my class and she also had four children. The two of us were unique. There was nobody else in the world we could talk to about what it was like. She is Norma Klein, and she just retired recently from Brookdale Community College. You ought to interview her. She also worked for the Welfare Board and then went to graduate school. We didn't know each other, but we met in school. We commuted together every day from here to New Brunswick. There was no Route 18 at that time. We went through the country roads until we could get to Route 9, but it was nice. I learned so much about New Jersey. I had grown up in a rural area in Chatham Township, and this territory that I was traveling through was like home to me. Central New Jersey was the Garden State. It was the agricultural center of New Jersey for most of the last of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century, until the cities started to expand and the suburbs started to develop, and you know what has occurred. In 1967, my mother came to our home and I was about to give up my social work career. I had finished a year in fieldwork at the Family Counseling Service of Middlesex County. It was one of the best family agencies in the state, and it was used by Rutgers as a field placement. It was hard to get in there, but I chose to go there because of its quality of the service, but I had to commute from Ocean Township everyday. We had old cars that used to break down occasionally.    Ms. Newman: Very bad winters, too.    Ms. Caplan: Bad winters. I remember the car on a country road, which is now in the Marlboro section, which was just absolutely empty.  There was nothing but forest at night coming home. The car just turned itself around 360 degrees. But there were nice adventures, too. But then my mother got sick, so we took her in, and Dad came down. It was a very difficult time. I figured I would give up graduate school at that point. She came in June and stayed until the fall of 1966. I figured I was certified to teach music in the state of New Jersey in the public schools. I figured I would take a job because the kids were all in school.  So I took a job in the Bangs Avenue School as a music teacher. The music teacher had gone on maternity leave, and I taught at the Bangs Avenue School for six months from January to June. The first few months I was busy with the illness and with everything. The superintendent of the schools of Asbury Park wanted me to stay, and gave me all kinds of inducements to stay in Bangs Avenue. It wasn't that I was such an outstanding musician. It was just that I really loved to work with those children and it was kind of a combination of my interest in music and also what I had experienced in social work. I really fell in love with those kids, even though they were very, very difficult to manage. Are you familiar with Bangs Avenue School?    Ms. Newman: Yes, I know where it is.    Ms. Caplan: It's on the West Side. It was always a segregated school. But it was certainly segregated by population at this time. I think there must have been about three or four white children in the school. They were from poverty-stricken families who lived in rooms in Asbury Park.    Ms. Newman: So your experiences as a welfare worker,  you felt, helped you to help these children in their lives.    Ms. Caplan: Well, I had fun with them. We sang and we danced. It was nice. It was really nice. My mother, of blessed memory, had come to this country when she was sixteen all by herself, and she was a very bright person. She couldn't go to school because she had to work in the sweatshops in New York. I mean hers is the typical immigrant story, only she came without family. But she was interested in social issues, always interested.  She used to tell me stories that when she first came here, she went to night school for a while.  I don't know how. And she met this very outstanding Black person who was advocating civil rights at that time in 1907 and 1908  it was the famous DuBois. She used to tell me, she would take walks with him and listen to the plight of the Black people, and she identified with it because it was so similar to what she had come from: a small town and poverty in Lithuania and a dysfunctional family and all that. So I was ingrained at an early age with the idea that everybody's fine and okay. It's not a question of tolerance. So teaching at Bangs Avenue was a very nice experience for me because I loved those children. Anyway, I don't want to advertise my great "non-racism" here, but it sort of came with the upbringing and with the Jewish experience. So I taught a half a year and then my mother seemed to be in remission. I thought now is the time we had to make a move, because we had four kids in this apartment with two and a half rooms that could be used for sleeping and living, and a kitchen and a living room: that's what we had. No playroom. Upstairs was an apartment. We were tired. We had a very short career as landlords. It was not a very successful one. We just weren't cut out for it. We wanted to find a home in Ocean Township.     Ms. Newman: So you were leaving Asbury Park for Ocean Township.    Ms. Caplan: Yes. By that time, the truth of the matter is that everybody we knew  in our community had moved out of Asbury Park. This was 1967 after the riots. The people who belonged to the temple had moved. We were Sabbath observers, so we had to find a place that we could walk to on Saturdays. So we had to find a place either in Colonial Terrace (the Rabbi lived in Colonial Terrace at that time) or further out. We couldn't find anything further out in the Township, it was impossible for us, because the kids were walking also. Well, I just about gave up the idea of going back to graduate school, but somehow there was some magic -- something that happened. I used to go down Bimbler Boulevard with the car  this was always a thorough fare, a shortcut from Wickapecko to Asbury Ave. It still is.  That's been a big problem for years, many years. I saw this beautiful house with an attached yard, and the yard was just full of the most magnificent flowers of every variety through all the seasons. These trees out here were lower, and it was just a magnificent garden, and this house looked friendly and old-fashioned to me. We had to move, we had to get out of the house we were in if we were going to start the school year. Actually, Hannah didn't go here the first year. I can't remember what it was that compelled us to move out that year. I think we got a buyer or something and here we were: we had sold the old house and we had no place to go. We knew a real-estate agent, a woman, and one day she said, "You know, there's a house out on Bimbler Boulevard. It's owned by an old couple." By the way, the people who lived here were named Smythe. He was in the roofing business in Asbury Park long before we ever came here. He was from the older generation. He was aging and he couldn't keep up this place. He wanted to move to Florida. His wife had been a teacher at Bangs Ave. School all her life, and she didn't want to sell this house. But somehow this agent convinced them one night to sell the house. My parents passed by this house,  took one look at it, and they said, "This is it." My father was a carpenter, and I guess he appreciated the way it was built. But we couldn't afford a house like this, we really couldn't, and I don't know what the agent did, but she made it affordable for us. At that time many of our friends were buying homes out in Ocean Township and Dwight Drive and all of those fancy developments. Middlebrook first began to become a development at that time. They were converting farms. Somehow this woman pulls up to our house and says, "Do you want the house on Bimbler? Sign the paper and you can get it right away." My mother was dying, I wanted to go back to graduate school, we had four kids, not enough room, and we didn't know what to do. If there was any chance that I could go back to graduate school in the fall, I intended to do so. We were entertaining ideas of moving into an apartment, but with the pressures of graduate school, I would not have survived. So that's how we moved into this house.    Ms. Newman: When did you move here?    Ms. Caplan: I think it was September of 1967.  Mother was in remission, and my parents were back home  in Chatham Township. I registered to go back to graduate school, and then I got a phone call that my mom was very ill again. So we brought her to this house, and I did go back to graduate school.  After I graduated in the summer of 1968, she died in this room.    Ms. Newman: But you were living in Asbury Park during the riot  is that right?    Ms. Caplan: We were living there during the riots.  I think there were two sets of riots. The first set we were living there. Now I'll tell you something that the kids loved when they were little. I bought all their clothing. I didn't have much time to go shopping. When they were little, I was totally occupied in those days. We had one car,  and the logistics of getting them to school were involved. I had to drive them to school  because they weren't in Asbury Park Schools, they were over here at the Hillel. I was very, very busy. So we went to Fish's Department Store to  shop for clothes.  Fish was a member of our congregation, and that was an adventure. We went several times a year to outfit  the boys. I had three boys. Of course for the girl, we had to maybe go to the Asbury Youth Center, which was really too expensive for us, that was on Cookman Avenue. We loved going to Fish's department store. My husband used to walk the children from home on 5th Avenue in Asbury Park to the congregation which was on Asbury Avenue off Grand. That's a good mile. So he used to walk the kids on the Sabbath morning. He wrote an article about this once. I think it was in the Jewish Voice a couple years ago. On Fifth Avenue and near Main Street, there was the Fisher Baking Company.  It was a very well known bakery in New Jersey. It was right here on Fifth Avenue. The kids would walk, but they would walk down Fifth Avenue with my husband. Any kind of weather, it didn't matter. I remember rainy days when we were up to here in water and we didn't know how we were going to get back home because it was flooded. We walked in all kinds of weather: we walked to shows, we walked to the shore on Saturday with the family. I stayed home when the kids were babies, I stayed home a lot, but he would take the older ones everywhere. I just remember this little thing: they were baking bread at the Fisher Bakery on Fifth Avenue and the smell was delicious. The bakers had the windows open and they let the kids come over the window and peek in and look at what was going on. I mean this was one of the adventures on the way to the synagogue. And another one: there was an Italian business that manufactured very fancy cookies on Main Street, and they used to watch what was going on there, too. There were lots of things that were so interesting on Main Street. They were all kinds of food stores and shops, and they would walk down Fifth Avenue to Main Street and then up to Asbury Avenue. They'd  pass the firehouse where they always greeted the fire trucks. The fire station is exactly the same building as it was then, and I understand it was there maybe fifty years before that. The fire chief is the Mayor of Ocean Township. We didn't know too many of our neighbors. I guess it was already past the time when people were neighborly. I guess in the early part of the century, people really lived in their neighborhood, but we didn't know too many of our neighbors. We didn't even know where many of the members of the congregation lived.    Ms. Newman: But you had an active social life at the temple?    Ms. Caplan: Yes. About the neighbors, we knew a woman who lived alone in a house who was very old, and there was a recluse on one side. On the other side there was a family with children. Sometimes we used the neighbors for baby sitting because they had older children. The mayor of Asbury Park lived down the street on Locust Drive. Locust Drive was upscale because it backed up on Deal Lake. You know there's a triangle formed by Locust Drive, 5th Avenue, and Sunset Avenue.  There was a little park there where everybody brought their dogs in the days before the scooper laws. The kids used to love that park, especially when it was full of snow, and they would chase all the dogs in the neighborhood. In the back yard, there was some neighborliness where they played with the kids in the back yard. They had some associations with some of the children in the neighborhood.     Ms. Newman: What happened after you received your degree from graduate school?    Ms. Caplan: After I got my degree, I became a working mother. It wasn't easy. It's not easy today. We didn't have all of the conveniences such as the microwave. In fact, we didn't even  have a dish washer, so it was a lot of planning to shop and to clean so forth.    Ms. Newman: You worked for different Boards of Education as a school social worker. From 1968 to 1972 it was Madison Township Board of Education, and then from 1972 through 1989 you were over at Henry Hudson Regional High School. In both of those you worked as a school social worker.    Ms. Caplan: Yes, I was a Child Study Team Member.    Ms. Newman: So what kind of work did you do?    Ms. Caplan: The main reason that I went into social work was so that I could be finished with my day's work at the same time that the kids were coming home from school. I did have some baby sitters, but it was just for maybe a half an hour or so. There were no kids with keys to the house in those days. Then I would come home and I would have to start all over again, which is I guess what working mothers have to do now. Only I think that they rely a lot more on packaged foods and canned foods. I did everything from scratch. That's the way I was brought up and that's the way I feel health wise it should be. I worked harder than most of my peers, even those who didn't work. I was unique among the women who were raising children. Some of them went back to teaching after the kids entered first grade. Nobody ever thought of going to work before children were in school. Now I'm not saying that's right or wrong, but it was  a different way of life, and the outcome will come later in research. It was a different way of life at that time with regard to what family responsibility was and with what the woman's role was. My husband was very tolerant and believed in encouraging women to express themselves. He didn't feel threatened by it, but he wasn't the typical husband.     Ms. Newman: So you worked for these different boards of education, and then at some point you set up your own practice, right?    Ms. Caplan: Yes, I started my own practice, and I did it right here in this room.  I went to Princeton for two years on a part time basis to a course at the Trinity Counseling Service. It was a program for training in family therapy, and I was trained in family therapy, which is different.  Family therapy does not mean family agency. Family therapy is where you see more than one person, you see the whole family,  you look at the family from a system's perspective. That was the new thing at that time  now we have integrated the idea of dealing with individuals and dealing with the family. The family has so much to offer in the way of understanding what is going on with a child. So in schools, I used to interview the parents, and I always tried to bend the system. I got in a lot of trouble at times. I would see the child with the parents and get them to participate in what the plans were for the child. I did some counseling in the schools, although that was not the school social worker's role. I was actually overqualified for the job because they didn't need a person with a graduate degree. They still don't. Now, there are many more people with a Master of Social Work. At that time I was an exception. I probably would have done much better if had worked in an agency, but I could not have had the summer off to be with my children. I would not have been able to come home after school and had the holidays off. I had to do what I felt my responsibility was.    Ms. Newman: I take it your children never felt neglected.    Ms. Caplan: There were difficult times when I was studying for exams. I don't have to tell you what a graduate program is like: they do a lot of busy work. We were doing six papers a semester: presentations, too, and a lot of the research had to be done up at Rutgers. I remember I parked myself in the Long Branch Library. I found that to be a nice quiet place to work where the librarian was very, very helpful. Often I would take books out at Rutgers and bring them to the Long Branch Library and find a corner there to study.  I would seek out library corners where I could just try to forget everything and study.    Ms. Newman: So how did you happen to set up your own practice?    Ms. Caplan:  I had always wanted to do private psychotherapy. I did some of it willy-nilly in the schools, not on a formal basis. I took the two-year post-graduate course. I would see parents and I would see children and I did some group work with children. I used to go into the classroom, take a few children in a corner, and we'd have a group discussion. There were dangers in doing that.    Ms. Newman: So you worked with the teachers and they moved you to children who were having problems?    Ms. Caplan: Yes. All the Child Study Team members there were qualified in one of three basic disciplines. The learning specialist knows all about the learning problems and the proper learning materials and curriculum, and then there was the psychologist who did batteries of tests on the children. The psychologist's and my counseling role often overlapped, but I was looking more at environmental and social factors. Then we would come up with what is still today mandated by the state and by the Federal Government. There is an individual aid educational program called IEP. That's a whole story in itself. We tried to come up with a plan that services the needs of a child, but you know how limited the resources are, and the bureaucracy, and the legalities. We had very high intentions, but it didn't work out that way, and you do the best you can.    Ms. Newman: But you had some gratifying experiences?    Ms. Caplan: Mostly with the children and their parents. I was always taking courses. I got certified in Parent Effectiveness Training in the early 1970s, so I taught a few courses at the Jewish Community Center in Deal in Parent Effectiveness Training. Then I taught one or two courses in the schools where I was teaching. I was always looking to expand my skills and my role. There were a lot of limitations which caused a lot of frustration. But I kind of smile at it all now because I guess I was innocent enough to think that I could do all of these things perfectly.    Ms. Newman: So by 1989 you no longer worked for the Board of Education.    Ms. Caplan: Towards the end of my career at Henry Hudson, I cut down to three days a week because I wanted to develop a private practice and I wanted to have experience. For two years I was a social worker counselor at the Hillel School where my children originally attended at Wayside. They have a very large institution there  it's like a college campus. They have preschool and high school and everything. So I did social work there and there I was able to do a lot more counseling, and there I was able to engage with parents, some of whom eventually became my clients on a private basis. I developed an ongoing private practice. Then when Mental Health Care swung into the HMOs, I began to be affiliated with HMOs. I do this for joy. I still enjoy my work very much, and it's kind of balanced because I have a limited caseload and I also teach yoga. Before I left the school system, I started to go up to a place in Massachusetts for vacation and studied yoga. I decided to become a yoga teacher. I certified to teach yoga at the Kripalu Center for Yoga in Lenox, Massachusetts. I started going there on vacation in 1984 and I received my certification in 1990.    Ms. Newman: You went there just for vacation?    Ms. Caplan:  Yes, and I started to get interested in yoga, and then in 1990 I took the certification training for a month. I lived up there for a month. This was after I retired. I was doing private practice, but I was finished with the public schools in 1989 and then I started to do yoga with just friends and my husband mainly. We love it and we still do it today. Now I teach yoga classes at home.    Ms. Newman: Have you seen differences in the kinds of problems that people have had since you set up your private practice in 1980?    Ms. Caplan: Addictions were beginning to be prevalent at that time. I think they're even more severe now. There was a steady increase in children becoming involved at an earlier and earlier age. Their parents of course were also addicts, but I don't think you saw it so much from one generation to the next as you do today. There is also the break up of the family. Most of the work today is not so much with parent-child problems, but post-divorce, post-separation problems, problems with being a single parent, court conflicts over custody: I try to stay away from that. Also problems of stress are more prevalent today. In fact, the average American family is in a state of high stress. Everybody is stressed out. Everybody is working longer hours than we ever dreamed of. My husband used to come home at 5:30 every night. There is no such thing now. Two working parents is a necessity now  the woman does not work for self fulfillment. You've heard these things before. It becomes overwhelming as people try to rise on the social economic ladder. Sometimes  they go way beyond what they can afford, and this is a constant problem, too. We're biting off more than we can chew in every way, financially, emotionally, and physically. I haven't come across any Internet problems yet, although you know our kids' generation was the first to watch television, which was the first big distraction. Now the Internet is becoming even a competitor to the television. What's amazing though, on the positive side of this, is that a little child a year and a half  to two years of age knows how to press the buttons and how to make the music come out and how to take a tape out and put it back in. They know that everything comes instantly with the press of a finger. Everything happens. Entertainment, everything. Children are bored today. There's much more peer interaction than parent-child, too, much more. I think that's because of the change in the geography, with the people moving far away. The three generational family is almost nonexistent. I mean relatives don't even live in the same area. And while the telephone and the car and the plane have made it possible for people to visit, it's not the same as having a grandparent around or having a grandparent to help with homework.  We have three grandchildren in Israel  I just spoke with one of them this morning. Although you do have contact over the phone, it's a more distant relationship. The peer group decides the values and what's in long before the advent of the adolescence.    Ms. Newman: But your children have essentially kept your family values.    Ms. Caplan: They definitely have kept our values. Each one in a little different way. We have been very fortunate that way. Two of them live in Highland Park and Edison -- the two younger  boys. The oldest one is in Israel. The daughter, who lived a West Side New York lifestyle, with a career that kind of stuff, married six years ago -- very late. She lives in Marlboro and she has a little baby. The two boys are similar, but  their families are different. They married very different types. One married a girl from Seattle, Washington. Well, didn't I set the example? I married a man from Detroit. I was on the cutting edge of what was coming, and I thought it was so wonderful. Now I'm sitting back here in my rocking chair and thinking, you know, the three generational family is not such a bad idea. There were a lot of negatives to it, such as having people interfere with one another's lives. But now when parent gets sick in Florida, for example, it's just an impossible situation. You have to have third party people to handle things or you have to run by plane to them. A friend of mine's daughter is the next generation. She lives in Australia and her father is isolated in Wanamassa. He's ninety something and declining and she's running from Australia to manage what is going on at Monmouth Medical Center, New Jersey, and this is not atypical.    Ms. Newman: Well it's been fascinating. Thank you very, very much.         
MonmouthCounty;Hendry and Russell;xxxx;2000;Hendry and Russell, xxxx, 2000     Remembering The 20th Century: An Oral History of Monmouth County   Nicy Marion Ham Russell (left) and Lillie Hendry Date of Interview: August 28, 2000 Name of Interviewer: Connie Paul Premises of Interview: Court Street School, Freehold, NJ Birthdates of Subjects: not available  The subjects for today's interview are sisters Nicy Ham Russell and Lillie Ham Hendry. They are long time residents of Freehold Borough. We will be discussing a number of events and institutions, including the  Court Street School, which is where this interview is being held. Both of the sisters attended this school and are active in its preservation.   "We learned from our parents that service was the price you pay for the space you occupy on earth." Lillie Ham Hendry  Ms. Paul: Lillie, you and I met when we were both working at Marlboro High School a long time ago. I forget how many years ago, but a long time ago. You were a guidance counselor there, and I was the librarian. It was in the 1980s, maybe?  Ms. Hendry: Connie, it was 1969!  Ms. Paul: You are right! So tell me where and when you were born, and then we'll introduce your sister and talk about some of your educational experiences. And you have a wonderful story that ties the two of you together, and your educational experiences in Freehold.  Ms. Hendry: Well, I am a native of Freehold Borough. I was born and bred here, as my mother and father used to say. It was right here in Freehold, New Jersey. From the age of seven months I have lived on the street where I still reside. That street is also the street on which I went to school from kindergarten through eighth grade. So Freehold and the community of Court Street, Avenue A, Avenue C, Throckmorton Street, and Haley Street was, and still is my core community.  Ms. Paul: Your territory.  Ms. Hendry: Yes.  Ms. Paul: And Nicy, were you also born right here?  Ms. Russell: No. I was born in New Bern, North Carolina, but my family moved here. My mother brought me to the area of Freehold which is now called West Freehold, New Jersey. I was there until I was about three or four years old. Then she moved back to North Carolina, and then we moved to Philadelphia for a short time. Finally, we returned to Freehold in May of 1923.  Ms. Paul: So who was in your family then? Lillie was not yet born then, right?  Ms. Russell: At that time, there were four of us. I am the oldest, then there is my sister Kathleen, my brother Walter, and my brother Joseph.  Ms. Hendry: And Daddy, whose name was Walter Ham, Sr.  Ms. Paul: And your mother's name was what?  Ms. Russell: Lilla, or Lillian.  Ms. Paul: Ok, so you moved from North Carolina to New Jersey, Philadelphia, and then back to New Jersey. And here your family stayed.  Ms. Russell: Back to North Carolina, and then New Jersey.  Ms. Paul: To New Jersey, where you were born, Lillie. And then your family stayed there ever since, right?  Ms. Russell: Correct.  Ms. Paul: So who became the total of your family then? Did you have other siblings?  Ms. Hendry: Yes, once we were here in Freehold, the four older siblings were joined by four younger siblings. And I am the oldest of the second set. There was a sister Leona, a sister Wilma, and then the baby was a brother, David.  Ms. Paul: So that was a big family.  Ms. Hendry: Quite a family, yes. Eight children, Mother and Dad. So there were ten people in our household.  Ms. Paul: So Nicy, you were trained as a nurse?  Ms. Russell: Yes.  Ms. Paul: And you, Lillie, were trained as a teacher?  Ms. Hendry: Yes. Then we have a person who was trained in the business area. That was my sister Leona. She worked for the government at Fort Monmouth for quite a number of years, also for the government at Earl Naval Depot for a little while. Then we have Walter, who became a certified public accountant. Joseph is very, very handy with his hands and he also had my father's talent, following in my father's footsteps. His family was quite large, larger even than ours. He followed my father's footsteps in becoming the custodian of Court Street School, and continued as a custodian in the Freehold Borough system. My father did this while he was raising his children, holding many jobs to make sure that the children were taken care of properly. Then there is my sister Wilma, who is a psychiatric technician and a supervisor with the NJ Employment Service. My brother David was with the Armed Forces for a number of years, and with the National Guard for a number of years. He became a licensed practical nurse, and was in NJ law enforcement. He also served as a special policeman for Freehold Borough.  Ms. Paul: You all have a whole community represented in your family. You could practically have your own town, right? (laughter) You needed a farmer, though. Nobody grew anything?  Ms. Hendry: My sister Kathleen, the next one to Nicy, certainly did know how to farm. And she knew how to cook and to preserve. She had my mother's talent in that way. My sister Wilma knows how to sew, and Nicy sews. They received my mother's talent in that way. Also my sister Wilma has a sideline: she loves to farm. Her front yard is not grass or lawn, but a garden for vegetables.  Ms. Paul: Good for her. It sounds like a wonderful life, like a close family.  Ms. Hendry: A very closely knit family. It was a family that depended on one other, and therefore became naturally closely knit. We depended on each other because of the love that our mother and father showed for us and with us. And they also directed us by example. They showed us how to care.  Ms. Paul: My grandmother, who had twelve children herself, had a rule: you didn't have to like everybody in the family, but you did have to love them.  Ms. Hendry: Yes, we can very much identify with that. (laughter) The children in our family are very much their own individuals.  Ms. Paul: So tell me this story.  Ms. Russell: I think you should add a little more with what Wilma has done. Not only was she psychiatric technician with the State, but she was also active with the Employment Service.  Ms. Hendry: Yes, she worked on that level with the State. She also became the first Negro, Black, Afro-American, of the Borough of Freehold Elementary School District to be elected to the Board of Education.  Ms. Paul: Wonderful. She is older than you, is that right?  Ms. Hendry: No, she is younger.  Ms. Paul: So education has obviously been a big part of your family life.   Ms. Hendry: A key part of Mother and Dad's philosophy for our family.  Ms. Paul: Where did you go to school?  Ms. Hendry: I'll let Nicy say where she attended school, because she led the way.  Ms. Paul: Good.  Ms. Russell: Before we came to Freehold to live permanently in 1923, I had been to school in New Bern, North Carolina, where I was born. Instead of going to public school, I was sent to a small private school. And then we moved to Freehold, and I started the third grade here at Court Street School. When I started school here, this school was only two rooms. During my first year, they  started building on two additional rooms. One was in the front, and one was in the back.   Court Street School building Ms. Paul: What year was this?  Ms. Russell: In 1923. We came to Freehold because there was an enormous fire, as people would say, in New Bern on Friday, December 1, 1922. It was an awful fire that raged through that community. There was a wind that blew and carried lose shingles from houses and set fires in different areas. So the town was practically burned out. The Red Cross came in and set up tents for families to live in, my family included. And we lived in that tent from the date of the fire until we moved to Freehold in May of 1923. I started school here at Court Street School in September.  Ms. Paul: And were there other siblings in school at that time?  Ms. Russell: Yes, the four of us except Joseph. Joseph was not in school yet. We used to have to walk him to where he was being kept all day while my parents worked. And the three older ones were in school.  Ms. Paul: So you graduated from Court Street School, and then what?  Ms. Russell: I graduated from Court Street School here, and it was very segregated at the time. As a matter of fact, we did not think it fair that we had to take what they called a State Examination, which has since been called the State Proficiency Test. We had to take the same one as the other children in the Broad Street School, which is located over here on Broad Street. The Broad St. School is an office building now across from that small shopping center. At that time when we came, the Broad Street School was a brown, wood frame building. Later it was replaced with the brick building you now see. Also the Hudson Street School, (which has been removed so they could put up the Hudson Manor Senior Citizen's Housing), was run for the "other children." And I am saying "other children" purposely. What is now the police station on Bennett St. was the high school. While I was at Court Street School, we paraded, asking for a newer and bigger high school to accommodate the children. Mr. Ladd, a local photographer, and his wife took the pictures. They were the ones who always took the school pictures. But in my time, they did not take pictures of the Court Street School children. So I don't have any pictures of me as a member of Court Street School. But later, by the time the younger siblings came along, they were taking pictures of all the children in the Freehold Borough School System, including the children at the Court Street School.  Ms. Paul: And you have some of those pictures in the school on display.  Ms. Russell: There are some of the pictures on display, but mine is not there, because they would not take pictures of us in the earlier years.  Ms. Paul: So you graduated from here in the eighth grade, and then where did you go?  Ms. Russell: I went to Freehold High School. That was another experience. I had passed the State Examination that I told you about, and I was told that I rated second along with children from Hudson Street School. And that school had a teacher for each subject. And we here at Court Street School used to be taught fifth through eighth grade, and one teacher taught all the subjects. Yet we had to compete with the children from Hudson Street School that had a teacher for each grade. We didn't know anything about moving from room to room, or changing classes, or going to different teachers. We had the same teacher for all of our schoolwork.  Ms. Paul: I think that I have read that this was the northern most segregated school system. Is that right?  Ms. Hendry: Not necessarily. Monmouth County had some. In the Freehold area, there was sort of a movie done, sort of a spoof on the area. But it also had some very factual things in the movie, and I have forgotten now what year that movie was done. But it had old flicks in it from past years, and they did depict the schools of Freehold Borough. It showed the children going into and out of the schools. And they depicted not only the Freehold Borough schools, but also Freehold Township and Marlboro. Of all of the pictures that I viewed on that movie, Freehold Borough's Court Street School was the only completely segregated one. In the Township School pictures, classes were desegregated, and the children were all together. And in the Marlboro pictures, the children were all together. However, I did note that in those pictures there were not as many Black youngsters as there were in Freehold. So I think we had a larger population of Black children, enough that the school system felt that they could build a separate school for them. You wouldn't build a separate school for only twelve children, like there were in the other areas. And I believe that the migrant workers and those who came to work in domestic homes were the original way in which the Black population began to stay here. Since the Freehold area had more people who stayed and settled with their families, there were more Black children who had to be integrated with the community schools. And integration was not a completely accepted form of education, as it still isn't in some places, although it would appear so on the surface. But here in Freehold, they had enough Black youngsters that it may have disrupted the whole so-called traditional provincial atmosphere here in Freehold. Therefore there was justification for establishing a Black school. But the original school was a house down at the foot of the hill on the western side of Avenue A. But that house became too small as more children and families began to settle here and stay.  Ms. Paul: Do you know when that house was started as a school?  Ms. Hendry: 1915.  Ms. Paul: And what did they do before that?  Ms. Hendry: I think most of the immigrants just moved on. But then they did allocate that little house as a school, and the first teacher there was Mr. Fenderson. I wish I had brought his bio, because I have a copy of that. But I did not bring that today. He evidently came from New England, and he had been a law student there. He came to Freehold and liked it as a little town, and he tried to get work in the law offices here. But the only thing he could get was clerking, or acting as a gopher for other lawyers. Then the opportunity came up for him to teach, and so he accepted. He was a magnificent role model and inspiration for the youngsters  he taught in that little building.  Ms. Paul: So that was like a K-8 school all in one building.  Ms. Hendry: Yes, in one building.  Ms. Paul: And then in 1919 to1921, they built this school where we are now. It had two classrooms.  Ms. Hendry: Yes, because the population outgrew that little house.  Ms. Russell: I think the church had something to do with that because they had started to set up an African Methodist Episcopal Church. They had set up a church in what was known as Squirreltown.  Squirreltown is next door to the St. Rose of Lima Cemetery. The church had a small frame building there on a one-acre lot, and the people all went there to church. They worked in farms and in homes here in this area. But as their families grew, their church became too small. They moved to Freehold Borough at the corner of Avenue A and Haley Street. The church still stands there, and the cornerstone reads 1885. They had started their church out there in 1840, but the membership kept growing and growing. Those people's children had to have schooling. So that helped the census for the building that they had at what is now Rhea Street. Then of course they had their school at Rhea Street from 1915 until 1921, when we got this building. But by 1923 or 1924, this building was too small. So they had to add on the two rooms.  Ms. Hendry: And since they were going to do a building project in Freehold Borough anyway, including the new high school, the two rooms for the Court Street School were built at the same time that the high school was built.  Ms. Paul: So the high school was built in 1921?  Ms. Hendry: 1926.  Ms. Paul: So you came from a two-room school, where you stayed in one room for fifth to eighth grade room all the time, and then you were sent to a high school that was integrated and much larger. So that must have been very confusing then.  Ms. Russell: My first week, I cried every day. The reason was I wasn't accustomed to changing rooms or teachers. I was used to having the same room, the same teacher, and the same seat in that room. When I went to high school, I will never forget it. My first day I walked into the room, and I was told I didn't belong there. I looked at my card I had, and it said that was the room number I was supposed to be in. So I went in, and they told me I didn't belong there. So I left. I didn't know that you had a principal that you go to when you have a problem. I was standing out in the hall crying, and I'll never forget. The principal saw me out in the hall, and she came and wanted to know why I was crying. I told her that I didn't have any room or any seat, that everywhere I went they told me I didn't belong there. So she finally took me to a classroom, and took me to the teacher, and the teacher told me to go and sit down. At that time the desks were hooked onto a seat. Well, I was given the very first one that didn't have a desk part to it. I was told to sit there. So I sat there. I had not been given any books or anything, and the teacher told everyone to take out their books. I told the teacher that I didn't have any, and that teacher told me to just sit there and twiddle my thumbs. So I cried again. I did not want to go back to school. I went home and told my parents, and mother told me to try and make it. She said if I did well, my father and she would see what they could do. So I went back. The next teacher I went to in that high school was the English teacher. I went into the room, and that person called out and asked me for my name. When I said Nicy Ham, the kids all laughed and started making jokes. So she stopped them, and she told me not to let it bother me. She said, "Nicy, ham and bacon are close together. We should be good friends." Because her name was Ruth Bacon, and my name was Nicy Ham. (laughter)  Ms. Paul: Oh, that's lovely.  Ms. Russell: So from that, I learned to take it lightly when they teased me about my name. I got to the place when they would start laughing at my name, I would say, "My name is Nicy, and it's the nearest thing to Spicy. Too bad I wasn't named Virginia, then I'd be a Virginia Ham." (laughter) Until I finished and came back here to work, nobody called me Nicy. They all called me Marion. They made such a joke out of my name, I just used Marion all the time.  Ms. Paul: Where does the name come from, do you know?  Ms. Russell: The name Nicy is from my grandmother on my mother's side. Her name was Nicy. She had said she wanted her first granddaughter to be named Nicy, so I am the oldest and the first of my mother's children. I got the name Nicy.  Ms. Paul: That's very nice.  Ms. Russell: I like it. It doesn't bother me that they teased me about it. I'll tell you anytime that my name is Nicy, and I write it down as my name.  Ms. Paul: So you stayed in Freehold Borough High School.  Ms. Russell: Yes, and graduated in the upper third of my class.  Ms. Paul: That's the tough thing about being the oldest in the family, because then none of your siblings had to go through that. You could show them where everything was and what the ropes were. I am the oldest in my family, too, you see. So I am sympathetic.  Ms. Russell: So you know.  Ms. Hendry: She really did lead the way. Although she wasn't always welcome, Mother and Dad told her not to expect to be welcomed. They told her she was there to learn and participate, and not just to be welcomed. And she became the first member of the high school orchestra. But she had a difficult time even doing that.  Ms. Russell: They had a teacher in from Asbury Park, and her name was Madame Kowashima. She taught music, violin lessons, to some of the children here in Freehold. I was the only Afro-American child that she had. When we all went to high school, the White children were put in the orchestra. So she told me, when I was graduating, that I needed to sign up for the orchestra in high school. I signed up. It took one whole year for me to get accepted to the orchestra. I was not given any excuse, I was just not told to come to the rehearsals or tryouts. And finally Madame Kowashima kept pursuing it, and she told me I played as well and better than some of the students that were already in the orchestra. And she didn't understand why I wasn't in the orchestra. So she took up the fight, and I was called to come to rehearsal. When I went, nobody else had to play anything to show their talent in playing the violin or viola. I was the only one. And I'll tell you one thing, I haven't touched my instrument in years, but I bet I could play Schubert's March Militaire. Because that was the piece of music that I had to play for them, and I played the first part for my audition. The first part carries the melody. You know you have first and second parts. The first part is the melody. The second part is just "da da." Well, when I was given a part to play in the orchestra (I was given the second part, which is the simplest part, but that was what I had to play), I played in the orchestra, and I cried. I didn't want to go. At that time Mrs. Jeanette Stitt was the music teacher. She came to this school, as well as the other schools. At one time we didn't have the Regional District. We had what was called Freehold High School, and the children from Farmingdale, Adelphia, Englishtown, Manalapan, Marlboro, and Colts Neck all came to Freehold High School.  Ms. Hendry: The capacity of the school at that time was 600 students.  Ms. Russell: I graduated June 17, 1932. My graduating class was 108 students. There were 100 Caucasian students, and eight Afro-Americans.  Ms. Paul: Those were really tough times for any family to keep their kids in school then. So that was a real tribute to all of you.  Ms. Russell: Teachers didn't help. I think it was vested interest because they took us on class trips. We were told we had to pay. It wasn't like they do now where the Board of Education makes sure that all children can participate in whatever activities they have, because they feel they are all learning experiences. When they were going anywhere, your parents had to find the money for you to go. And if they didn't find the money for you, you just didn't go. Our Afro-American families, and some of them are still here in part of the community, would find the money for their children to go…  Ms. Hendry: Or their churches would support their pursuit of a high school education.  Ms. Russell: And yet when they got there, they couldn't participate in all the activities. For example, I don't eat at Child's Restaurant today. They took me there for my high school senior trip. When we got there, it was late. We went to the Foreign Exchange.  Ms. Paul: Was this New York City?  Ms. Russell: Yes, New York City. We went to the Paramount Theatre, and I'll never forget that we saw Billy Holiday. That was the show that we saw. Afterwards, we were taken to Childs Restaurant, and we had paid the same amount of money that everybody else did for our dinner. And for some reason, the eight of us could not eat there. We were taken to Nedicks, where I don't eat anymore either. We were told we could have hot dogs and diluted orange drink, and that's what we were given.  Ms. Paul: The teachers told you that?  Ms. Russell: The teachers allowed it to be done to us. And one teacher went with us to Nedicks, but that wasn't a part of what they had sent home for us of what we were going to get. So I don't eat at Child's, and I don't eat at Nedicks. And I know Nedicks had nothing to do with it. They were not to blame. But I also feel that the teachers had a vested interest in their jobs so they didn't make any fuss about it. We were just given hot dogs and diluted orange juice.  Ms. Paul: In the 1930s, were there  a lot of segregated eating places in New York City?  Ms. Russell: That was in 1932. And it is still going on. I'll say this much. We can have all kinds of laws and say they are in effect, but it's what is inside the people's hearts, souls and bodies that cannot be enforced. I have been working with a group that I would figure to be the last place you'd find segregation or mishandling of people's rights. But I found it. And I'm giving them my service, which is not a service that you can pick up from just anybody. It took the monies that my parents put down for me to go to school, to get that knowledge, to be able to give that service. They are glad to receive my service, but I found them being very prejudiced.  Ms. Paul: And it still hurts, doesn't it?  Ms. Russell: It hurts. But I stay there because I figure if I don't try to work it out, what will happen to the others? I have been with this group over twenty-one years.  Ms. Hendry: And it's a government group.  Ms. Russell: It is a County group. I have more experience and more educational background than one of the young ladies that was of another persuasion. I was told, when I was sworn in, that the chairmanship of the committee moved according to seniority. When it was my turn to be the Chairman, the young lady brought me all the materials to read and told me to be prepared. I took it home and went over it all. When we had the next meeting, someone else had been made the Chairman.  Ms. Paul: And what did they say?  Ms. Russell: She said it was not her doing, it was out of her hands. So I went to the Judge, and I asked for an appointment. And he told me the experiences that he had, because he was of another persuasion. But I eventually got to be Chairman. And this is all volunteer work. And if that young lady had been more qualified than I, I wouldn't have said a word. But it goes on still.  Ms. Hendry: And that was within the last five years.  Ms. Paul: I'm sure that is true.  Ms. Russell: And they can't keep an Afro-American in there. There have been about four or five. One has expired, one moved, and I don't know what has happened to the others. But they disappeared and didn't stay with it. You say to yourself, "Why give my services and take this kind of treatment?"  Ms. Paul: So you graduated from Freehold Borough in 1932.  Ms. Russell: Yes. I went to Wilberforce University for one year, in Zenia, Ohio. During that one year, I did one and a half year's work, because my dad and mother told me not to play with their money.  Ms. Paul: Because there were seven more behind you.  Ms. Russell: They told me I was going there to learn, and learn I did. But my sister Kathleen was very ill and hospitalized, and I knew those were expenses for my parents. At that time, we didn't have health insurance or things like that. So instead, I got myself a position at Marlboro State Hospital. There again, it was an experience. Here I was, a graduate of high school with one and a half years of college work. I was told that I could have a position working with the patients. However, when I arrived I was told I was assigned as a domestic in a doctor's home. But the others were not even finishing high school, and they were working in the patient cottages and in the offices. I can also tell you that when World War II came along, we were working there for forty dollars a month. When the War broke out, in order to keep the people at Marlboro, the state raised the salaries of those of us who worked in the doctors' cottages from forty to sixty dollars a month. There were five of us Afro-Americans working there. Do you know they did not give us the extra twenty dollars a month?  Ms. Paul: And how could they get away with that?  Ms. Russell: They got away with it until I took it up. The one girl who worked for Dr. Baker asked me if I had received my raise. I told her no. She told me they had all received a twenty dollar raise.  I did go to the library to try to find the newspaper that carried the article. I got the article  we didn't have copiers then. So I had to copy it down. And I asked the librarian if I could borrow the original one, if I had to. I took it in, showed it to them, and asked where was our twenty dollar raise. We finally got the twenty dollars a month more, but it was not retroactive.  Ms. Paul: So you had to fight for it.  Ms. Russell: I have had to fight all of my life for what I was due. I wasn't asking for something that I wasn't due. I was telling you I had gone to Wilberforce. I decided maybe I could go into nursing, and I wanted to try it and see how I liked it. They were giving this course at night at the Broad Street School. I went and asked to sign up, and they said no. That's how I ended up going to Harlem Hospital, because the schools in New Jersey were not accepting Afro-Americans. Rider College did send me an application for scholarship before I went to Wilberforce, but I went to Wilberforce because I didn't want to be rejected. I didn't think that Rider knew that I was an Afro-American. (laughter) I didn't want to take any chances. Wilberforce offered me a small scholarship. I took that.  Ms. Paul: So you went to Harlem Hospital and studied nursing there?  Ms. Russell: Yes.  Ms. Paul: And when was that?  Ms. Russell: I went in February of 1943, because they were taking students every six months. I enrolled February 1, 1943, and I graduated February 1, 1946.  Ms. Paul: And were you working at the hospital during that time, as well as studying there?  Ms. Russell: It was a work-study program, and they gave you a diploma. I went into Cadet Nursing at that time when World War II was on.  Ms. Paul: Was that through the Army?  Ms. Russell: It was through the government. They said you didn't have to go into the Armed Services when you finished, so I took a chance on it. I was the last one in my class to sign up.  Ms. Paul: So you graduated in 1946. Did you start work as a nurse then?  Ms. Russell: Yes, I worked in Harlem. Well, during my Cadet nursing period, they were so short of nurses, that they took what they called "strong students" and made us Head Nurses, so I got the experience of being a Head Nurse in the Communicable Disease Hospital then. I was often supervising my classmates and others.  Ms. Paul: So you lived in New York at that time?  Ms. Russell: In my student days, I lived in the student quarters there. During the training you went through Communicable Diseases. We had to go through tuberculosis out at Sea View on the Island, and we went to Belleview Hospital for psychiatric training. And that was another experience, because we had the students coming from Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia. They didn't want anything to do with us, even sharing an elevator or sitting at the table to eat with us. When one of us would sit down at the table where one of them was sitting, they would say, "Suddenly I lost my appetite." So we had them "lose their appetite" all the time.  Ms. Paul: And that was while you were doing your practice of nursing?  Ms. Russell: Yes. So then we had graduation. In the meantime, because we were part of the Cadet Nursing Program, Uncle Sam sent you to different hospitals for the last six months. I was sent to Tuskegee, Alabama for my last six months of training. I worked with the veterans at a Veteran's Hospital there. That was an experience because we got to work on some of the soldiers, with some of their injections or whatever. And I found out what it meant to work in a larger government institution. I finished from there and came back to Harlem for graduation. And after graduation, I started working at Harlem. And that was another experience.  Ms. Hendry: But that wasn't the end of her education.  Ms. Russell: No. While working at Harlem, I moved up. I never had to ask for a promotion. I got my promotions by them picking me, so much so that I got tired of hearing, "I'm looking for a strong…" (laughter) I didn't want to hear that anymore. But it helped. I have my Diploma of Nursing. I took my State Board, and I passed it the very first time I took it. Then I went on to finish up and get my Bachelor of Science Degree.  Ms. Paul: Where did you go?  Ms. Russell: Hunter College. At the time I went to Hunter College, it was all girls. It was all females and no males. After finishing there, I thought I was in the lineup, going through rehearsal for graduation exercises. But everything was clear when I got a call to come to the Bursar's Office. When I got there, he told me my records didn't show that I was graduating. It was a good thing that I had carried my school reports. I don't know why I did that, but the Good Lord watches out for fools, old folks, and drunks. So I guess I fit in there somewhere. Anyway, I had carried my records with me to that rehearsal. I took them out and showed them to him. And he told me to go back to my rehearsal. At the time when you are young, you know, you don't know all the things you should do. I was working at Harlem, and I had to take my days off when I worked 3:30 to 12:00 so I could go to night classes. I had a class that overlapped just a few minutes, like ten or fifteen minutes. So I asked one teacher if I could come to her class ten minutes late, and I asked the other teacher if I could leave her class ten minutes early, because of this overlap. They both agreed, and I was happy about it. I did not think I had to get it in writing. It never dawned on me. So when this came up that I was called to the Bursar's Office, one of the teachers who had said I could come to her class fifteen minutes later…and you can only have three tardiness times…she had said I had four tardiness times. The reason I had asked the two teachers was that if there was something being discussed in class that was important enough that I stay, then I could go to the other class late. Or if there wasn't anything much I would be missing, then I could leave and be on time for the other class. Well, it just so happened that I had four tardiness times instead of three. And she had decided to say that although she gave me an A- for my work, she took off for that. So I took the case to the Grievance Committee, and I won. I told them I didn't know I should have gotten it in writing. But her name was Gottdank and you know what I was calling her.  Ms. Paul: Yes, I'm sure. (laughter)  Ms. Russell: But anyway, I got my points back and I didn't lose out on that.  Ms. Hendry: But she wasn't satisfied, so she went on and did her social work at Kean College. She got her New Jersey Social Work Certification, and she ended up right back here in Freehold serving the community for the Freehold Board of Education as its Educational Social Worker, which was her third career in her life. She spent thirteen years with the Freehold Borough Elementary School System as their social worker.  Ms. Paul: So that's why you were passing on students that you had in the elementary school, Nicy, to your sister at the high school, you were double-teaming them. (laughter)  Ms. Russell: When I caught one of the kids doing something he shouldn't, he said, "Miss Russell, you know I'm going to high school next year." And I told him he needed to meet my sister. He looked at me with wide eyes, and he was so surprised. So sure enough, one day he was flying down the hall at the high school and bumped into Lillie. And Lillie let him know who she was. (laughter)  Ms. Paul: You can run, but you can't hide. Oh, that's wonderful. And it's wonderful for the community, that you had that kind of continuity with the kids and could keep your eye out for them.  Ms. Russell: Right now, in the school, I felt good. But many of the kids are in Catch 22, I guess I would call it. I had asked the principal and even the superintendent not to keep suspending the kids. I told them to send them to me instead. I had a little office, and I used to open the door, swing it back and say, "Would you step into the parlor said the spider to the fly." (laughter)  Ms. Paul: Oh, that probably made them really comfortable!  Ms. Russell: And they would go in there, and I would thrash them out. And after I thrashed them out, I said, "Now if it gets back, you'll tell it because I won't." And the principal and the superintendent used to ask me what I did or said when the kids would come back all nice and apologetic. And I would tell them I wouldn't say. And I never told them. When I asked to have the kids go to the Y for Water Safety, I couldn't get a single teacher who wanted to give up time to go with that busload of kids to the Y in East Freehold. So I said I would take them. And I took the whole busload of kids. The Y provided the bus and the driver, but we had to have someone for the supervision of the students. I didn't have any problems. I walked around the pool, and I had no problems with them. One kid's watch disappeared, and I asked for that watch to be returned. It hadn't been returned. We got back to the school, and I told them I wanted the watch. I told them I wouldn't ask any questions, but I just wanted the watch back. And all of a sudden the watch went up in the air! And I got the watch back, and I never had any more problems. I had been in the girls' dressing room, and I carried this big purse so I could carry any small article or anything the kids wanted me to keep safe for them. So I told the boys that since this watch had disappeared, I would be in the boys' dressing room if it didn't reappear. And I never had to go into the boys' room.  Ms. Paul: So what years did you work for Freehold Borough?  Ms. Russell: From 1966 until 1981.  Ms. Hendry: When she started with the Borough, I left the Borough as a Guidance Counselor to go to the high school, as I was invited to do. But I was sure to leave someone there that I could always communicate with in reference to youngsters. Not that I couldn't communicate with anyone in the system, but we had a special communication. She came in as I left.  Ms. Russell: It was really September of 1965.  Ms. Hendry: But we were not there together.  Ms. Paul: OK. Lillie, what is your story?  Ms. Hendry: My story is very small in reference to her story. The beginning of my story is Nicy. She always was what we would call a pathfinder in our family. Mother and Dad always said if you were older than the next one, you were watched. And therefore, you had to be a good leader. So she had seven people watching her. I was lucky, because I had only three watching me. (laughter) However, not only did we watch her, but we also looked up to her. And she watched us. We were taught that the older ones were responsible for the younger ones. So it was a two-way watch, and it was very, very beneficial to all of us. We learned to be responsible not just for ourselves, but for those with whom we came in contact. We learned that service was the price you pay for the space you occupy on earth. And so you served. We learned that you are where you are because others cared. And so you should care so that others could also progress. These were all philosophies from our parents. And what our lives have been are products of that philosophy.  Yes, I was born here in Freehold. Freehold is my hometown, as well as somebody else who wrote a song about it. And I went to Court Street School, as well. I went from kindergarten through eighth grade. I loved every moment of it. My first grade teacher, Rosa B. Reed, was the wife of the principal, George I. Reed. She was my ideal through kindergarten and first grade  I looked up to her because she was so patient. She could read a story and have you visualize the pictures, even though there were no pictures in the book. She taught us how to be polite, and how little girls should sit like little ladies. She taught the little boys how to behave. And she taught it all in the sweetest voice and with the sweetest smile you could ever imagine.  Ms. Paul: How many kindergarten students were there?  Ms. Hendry: It was a kindergarten/first grade combination, so you were lucky enough to have her for two years. Now all students may not have felt so lucky, but personally, I felt it was really a wonderful thing to be in the classroom for two years with the same teacher. What you didn't learn one year, you learned the next. Also what you learned, you reviewed so that you really knew. So I appreciated the fact that there were two grades that were together in the same room. Now when we got to Mr. Reed's room, it was the sixth through eighth grade. My friend, Mabel Banks, and I often wanted to be with the younger children. We just liked younger children. So when we went out for recess, we would play with the younger children as much as we played with the older children. Mrs. Reed sometimes had sick days, and Black substitutes were not that plentiful. Therefore, Mr. Reed would tell us if we did our work and got it correct, we could be in that younger classroom to help out when Mrs. Reed was not well. And that was my first experience of teaching. I always had my work done, as did Mabel, and Lugenia Harris Jefferson.  Ms. Paul: I know her from Habitat.  Ms. Hendry: Yes, she was another very good student. And there was Dorothy Lee and several more of us.  Ms. Paul: What a smart man.  Ms. Hendry: Mr. Reed would tell us when Mrs. Reed did not come in, and he would ask for volunteers. Mabel and I would always volunteer. We did not mind leaving our peer group, and we wanted to come into this room, which was the size of the regular room now, and be with the younger ones. So I think from those experiences and from having Mrs. Reed as a teacher, I got the teaching bug. I got through elementary school here at Court Street School with guidance from Mr. Reed, who always instilled in the students before you left the school, the pride that the school and the teachers had in you, and what they expected you to do. You knew they expected you to exemplify  this school when you were in other places. He said, "I always wanted to hear that people know you came from Court Street School because of the way you behave, because of what you achieve, and because of the way you plan for your future."  Ms. Paul: He sounds like a wonderful man.  Ms. Russell: He was. And he not only stuck with you while you were in school. As Lillie told you, we students had to substitute because we did not have substitutes like you have now in schools. The students had to do it. I did it for the classes while I was here, just like she and Lugenia did it for their classes. But also when I went into Nursing School, I had been out of school seven and a half years and my concentration was not the best. I wrote Mr. Reed a note and told him the problem I was having. That man sent me a book on concentration, and I used it. And I got right back into being able to do my work. I just couldn't concentrate, and for some reason things just were not clicking. I guess I had been away from it for so long. But Mr. Reed sent me that book, and I read it. He was like that.  Ms. Hendry: He also said when we went to high school or in life, if we had need of his services or the services of any other teacher in Court Street School, we should not hesitate to come back. Miss Louise B. Jones, who graduated from the school and lived in the community, tutored students all summer long, free of charge. So you always knew that if you came from Court Street School, you had people "in your corner." And you would always be welcomed back and not admonished because you had to come back. But you would be welcomed back cheerfully because there was something else they could do for you. That kind of spirit was the spirit of Court Street School.  Ms. Paul: No wonder you are both still so attached to it now. That really does go a long way to explain why the place means so much to you.  Ms. Hendry: And so much to the alumni of the school, which is why we really campaigned not to have the building destroyed. Now we were lucky, too, in reference to Court Street School. There was a gentleman who moved into our community whose name was Ralph Allen. He also was with Habitat, and also a community minded man. Now he came from South Jersey. I have forgotten the name of the town. But he said in his town was a segregated school, very much like Court Street School. He said so much of his talent and motivation to learn and serve came from there. People in his town tried to save that little school, and they were not successful. So he said if we wanted to save this one, he would help us save it. He did a tremendous job of campaigning for the preservation of the Court Street School, working with the legislators, the Monmouth County Board of Freeholders, and the New Jersey Historic Trust to get the grants to restore the school. He also worked with the program facilitators in designing and researching the needs of the community for possible programs for the school. So Ralph Allen really needs to be very much appreciated for what he did. Anyway, let's get back to Court Street School. I graduated from there and went to the high school, as did most of the youngsters from Court Street School. Even though I didn't go Freehold High School until 1943, I was confronted with some of the similar things that my sister had met up with years before. When we went to the school, we had our schedules and our room assignments. But I was told also that I didn't belong in some of the classes because my course was called the "classical course" at that time. It was the college prep course. It was almost a foregone conclusion, even then and with other Black students who had gone through the high school and gone on to college, that you were not supposed to be in the college prep course. There was either the classical course or the scientific course, and those were the two college prep extremes. So I sat in the auditorium, waiting for my schedule to be changed, which it should not have been. It was the way it was supposed to be. At that time, we did not have guidance counselors. We had class advisors. And my class advisor said to me, "Your parents have a lot of children. You'll probably have to work after high school to help with the family." Well, there were three younger than me, and there were four older that she had nothing to do with. They were out on their own. None of the four were still in high school when I went to school. So they must have been successful. But it was as if she was saying that was my obligation. And I wasn't told to sit and twiddle my thumbs, but I did it. Then my mom and dad made an appointment with the same principal who had helped Marion out. She was still there, Lillian Lawlor. They came to the school, and we went into her office. Mother and Daddy explained to her that the teachers had no right to tell their child what the future was going to be. It was the mother and father's responsibility to do that. They told her I was enrolled in the classical course, and I was to stay in that course if I could succeed there. They also told her if I didn't succeed, to let them know, and they would remove me, because it would be for my own good. But she was to give me the chance to succeed.  Ms. Paul: Were there other Blacks in the classical course at that time?  Ms. Hendry: One, Ann Edwards. The others were in clerical, home economics, or general. Ann and I were in the classical course. Ann was a year older than I was. So we went back, and we had our Latin, English, and all the other classes. I succeeded! My advisor said I was doing well. Mother and Dad told me to go right back to Court Street School if I needed anything. I did come back for my writing skills and my punctuation skills. I did not have to come back for public speaking. (laughter)  Ms. Russell: I had the same thing. I was told that I couldn't have the classical course, because that's what I had signed up for. It turned out that they came to see my mother and father twice. First they came to see them at lunch time about my music and playing in the orchestra. And they came to see them about what they planned to do about my going to college.  Ms. Hendry: You know there is a difference between the time she was there and when I was there. They came to the house to see Mom and Dad when she was there. But my mother and father went to the school when I was there. That, to me, is a significant change. I always wanted to be active in the school activities because at Court Street we had plays, music, and exhibits for our parents. Children were always participating. But at the high school, when I tried to sign up for the school play, the only role that was available in the play was that of a maid.  Ms. Paul: How did I guess that, somehow!  Ms. Hendry: The maid's name was Little More. My Black peers were very much against my playing that part. So I came home and talked to Mother and Dad, who, you can gather now, were our counselors besides being our parents. We brought everything to them. And somehow or other, they helped us solve things. They said, "Well, Daught," and that was short for daughter. They said, "Well, Daught, if you want to do it, you do it. If you don't want to do it, don't. But you make the decision." I felt in my heart that if I didn't take that part in that play, I would never get a part in another play in high school. So I took the part, and I played it well. And I got ostracized by my peers. But the next year when the play came up, I was given an angelic role. And my name was Angelica, and I played an angel. The other persuasion was surprised at a Black angel. But I'd rather they be surprised at a Black angel than very, very accepting of another Black slave. Then my senior year, I got to be the student director of the play. So I learned that you really have to crawl before you can walk, and then once you walk you can run.  Ms. Paul: So you graduated from Freehold High School.  Ms. Hendry: Yes, before it was regionalized. During that time, I was in the orchestra and played the viola. I followed in my sister's footsteps and played the viola, and I was also in the band. I played percussion. I was also in the school plays and the dance club, because I loved to dance. I was in Student Council. So high school was an extension of Court Street School's participation.  Ms. Paul: It explains to me why it has taken me months to schedule this interview, because you are never home. This has been the pattern of your life, right? Involved in a dozen different things?  Ms. Hendry: Well, my mother and dad always said, "Don't ever let me catch you idle." And they meant that.  Ms. Paul: And they obviously never did catch you. But I don't know about the others. Good heavens, Lillie! (laughter)  Ms. Hendry: High school was a good experience for me. I didn't have as many bitter experiences as Nicy. Or perhaps because of her, I knew how they could happen, so I was psychologically ready for them. And that was a gift that she gave us, as well. I wrote the graduation song, for the farewell. We had a twentieth century daisy chain, in 1947, and of course that was just after the War. The fellows came back from the War in 1946. So we got through all of that, and we also lived through air raid sheltering. Court Street School served as an air raid shelter during the War, and it was fascinating. We lived right down the street from the school, and we could watch the air raid drills with the air raid wardens with their helmets and their flashlights. We also had to know what to do in the schools, and we had an air raid drill mandated as well as a fire drill. You would get out into the hall against your locker, with your arms up, or on the floor. So you knew just what to do. So I have to really give credit to the school system. They did participate in all the preparations for disaster or whatever. And that was a time when you didn't know what was going to happen.  Ms. Paul: Well there were submarines right off of New Jersey, right? So it was a scary time.  Ms. Hendry: That's correct, it was scary. But you felt secure because you were taught what to do. So that was a good thing, too.  Ms. Russell: The rationing was done here at Court Street School, also.  Ms. Hendry: It was the ration station. And the students in seventh and eighth grade, as Nicy Marion said, "the strong students," were allowed to issue ration stamps and books for gasoline, sugar, butter, flour, and soap. There were certain ration tickets or stamps that you issued for each item. And that was a responsibility of citizenship that we learned very early. So when we talk about the twentieth century, that was a part of it.  Ms. Paul: Well I was born in 1944. And there were no rubber pants then, so my mother told me about how embarrassed she was at a family reunion. I had gotten her all wet in church, and she was out in the parking lot walking up and down trying to dry her dress before the luncheon started. (laughter)  Ms. Hendry: And there was no plastic. Television was not there. It was a different time. But then after high school, or during my senior year, I applied to several colleges. It was a foregone conclusion that you were going to go off to college. I knew that I wanted to teach. I truly knew that I wanted to teach. So I applied to colleges, and I got a full scholarship to Hampton University in Virginia, which is a Black college. I got another one from the college my sister went to, Wilberforce, in Ohio. There was another one that I got. But it didn't matter to me, because I knew where I wanted to go. I applied for scholarship aid for the State of New Jersey, because I did not want to go far away from home. Many youngsters want to get as far away from home as they can. I didn't. I think that was really credited to the fact that our family had such a strong bond. I didn't feel that secure too far outside of that bond. So I applied to Trenton State College, and at that time it was difficult to get in. And it is now. However, my advisor helped me with my application. I think she did it sort of shaking her head, but she did it. I got the interview, and that was an experience. We had what we called "the doodle bug," which was the little two or three-car train that came through Freehold from Asbury Park to Trenton. I was given the date for the interview, and Daddy took me down and put me on the train. He gave me taxi-money from the train station out to the college for my interview. I had done the application, and I had written a composition about my life, and all of that. I prepared for the interview. Mother had made me wear a hat and gloves, so I would make the right impression. I got there ahead of time, and I found someone and asked them how to get to Green Hall, which is where my interview was being held. I got to Green Hall and into the room, and I was sitting there waiting for whomever was going to come in. This very Victorian-looking person came in. She sat down and she said, "Well, you're Lillie Ham." And I said, "Yes, I am." And she said, "From Freehold, New Jersey." And I said, "Yes, I am." I tried to smile, because she was so stoic. She said, "You think this is a laughing matter?" And I said, "No, I don't." She said, "Well, let's just get right down to business." She began to go over facts that she wanted to know about my life and why I wanted to teach. She asked where I wanted to teach, and what grade level did I think that I wanted. I said, "Any two grades would be ok." She said, "What do you mean any two grades?" And I explained what had been my experience. She said, "Do you not know that there is one grade per classroom?" And I said, "I was never in a classroom with just one grade." She said, "You weren't?" And I said, "No, each of my classrooms had two or more grades." At the end of the interview she said, "Do you want to know what I think of you?" I thought she was going to tell me whether or not she felt I could come to the college. I was ready for either answer. I told her yes. She said, "I think you are peculiar." I always remember how my heart sank! I could live with being called a failure or a success with getting into college, but peculiar? That's somewhere out there that you don't know what you are! So I came home and asked my mom, "What about me is peculiar?"  Ms. Paul: She didn't say anything except that?  Ms. Hendry: That's all she said. And she asked me if I wanted to know. And I often wondered what she would have said if I had told her I didn't want to know. But I said yes. So I asked my mom what was peculiar about me. And she said she felt I had a nice voice, she felt that I sang beautifully, but I hadn't sung for this woman, but had sung in choirs, etc. And she also said I was very serious. I told Mom that this lady said I thought it was a laughing matter. None of those descriptions of myself that my mother gave me fit the situation. So my whole four years of college, this lady was my advisor because she was head of my department. Every time she looked at me, I knew she felt I was peculiar. One of the most inspiring experiences that I had at Trenton State was during my sophomore year: There was a lady by the name of Bertha Lawrence, who was a dean of the college and who visited every class of our particular curriculum, which was the Kindergarten/Primary curriculum. That evidently was her domain. She called me into her office. All of our classmates were very bonded together. When I first went, I was the only Afro-American in the class. When we went for our Big Sister/Little Sister Day at orientation, I had four other Little Sisters. We were all with, thank goodness, a girl from my hometown. She lived right up Court Street near Main Street. When she got my name, she came down to the house and told me I would be in her Little Sister group. And I was thrilled. Her name was Marianne Vanderveer. Marianne and I had waved hello as I walked down Court Street going to town quite often. So I felt very good that she was going to be my Big Sister. She had four others, and none of them had ever had any association with a Black American. So Marianne's job was to get everybody speaking to each other, with nobody being excluded. And she did a wonderful job of it, she really did. So our class eventually really knitted together. There were sixty-two of us to begin with. We graduated from Trenton State with fifteen!  Ms. Paul: Oh, my!  Ms. Hendry: The attrition rate was tremendous. Of course every time someone left or did not return, we all were shaking in our boots. Because that same lady who interviewed us was our advisor, and she remained stoic throughout. But I think the fifteen of us survived because we learned to bond together and to be supportive of one another. In our sophomore year, we were not yet down to fifteen. But during that year, Miss Lawrence came into our music class and asked if I would come with her back to her office…in the middle of the class. And everybody wondered what I had done now. (laughter) I liked fun, I really did. And sometimes I guess because people weren't used to us and our type of humor, I just broke the class up. Anyway, I walked across the campus with Miss Lawrence. And she was chattering away happily, and I wondered why I was being called into her office. When we got there, there were two representatives from the State House in Trenton. They had come to her because they were going to have a naturalization ceremony for people to become citizens of the United States. And they needed a student speaker. And she had suggested me! I told you in high school I had never had to worry about public speaking. And I was so excited to think about speaking to people who wanted to become American citizens. It was unbelievable. I went back to my class and told my classmates, and we had no more class that day. (laughter) And they all helped me write my speech. And mother insisted I wear the hat and gloves. Miss Lawrence drove me to the State House, to this big mahogany room. It was the chambers, and it was just something. Anyway, it went well. The faces of those people who were from all over the world! There were about fifty-three of them, if I remember correctly. And I don't know now exactly how those words came out, but they affected the people I was looking at the way I wanted. You can study a speech, you know, but it doesn't always come out the way that you studied it. But this evidently came out even better. And so it was a wonderful success. I got back to the college, and of course all the girls wanted to know what happened and how it went. And I told them it went well. And they said, "Oh, we didn't know our prayers would be answered." In the middle of a class, they had all stopped and folded their hands and bowed their heads. And the teacher told me the next day that I was the only one that could get our class quiet.  Ms. Paul: Oh, I love hearing that.  Ms. Hendry: It was really a thrilling experience, and I will always remember that from Trenton State. It was difficult there, but I had to come back to the community of Freehold Borough, especially the Black community. I could always come home to my church for encouragement, which was Bethel AME Church. And I could go to the members of the congregation because many of the older mothers of the church just adopted all of the children. There was my mom, of course, and then my second mom was Miss Sadie Lewis. And then there was Miss Dora Jackson. They would cook and send things to you. When you came home from school to church, you had to go back into the choir even if you hadn't been there for rehearsal. And everybody was always so glad to see you. So you got through college and the hard times because of the Black community that surrounded you with love, acceptance, and support. Of course, there was always the thought that when you came back, you would serve. It wasn't repeated to you, but it was always in the back of your mind. You saw it being done all the time. So there was no other way that you envisioned life except to come back and serve. Well, we got down to fifteen classmates for college graduation. And we were a happy fifteen people, let me tell you. But before graduation, we had to do our practice teaching. And I did my practice teaching in Red Bank. That was an experience, too, because there was no train between here and Red Bank. There was a bus, which ran some of the time. My dad would have to take me in his old car, and sometimes we didn't know if it would get off the block much less onto the road! He would try to get me to Matawan Station to catch the train from there to Red Bank. Then I'd load all my school things up, get back on the train to Matawan, and get picked up there. There was a person with whom I became very good friends, whose husband rode a motorcycle. She worked at Bendix in Red Bank. Her husband would ride her on the motorcycle to Bendix. And when the bus didn't run, I would be the third person on the motorcycle. He would drop her off at Bendix and motorcycle me over to my practice-teaching school. Then at the end of the day, I would take a train back to Matawan. And it was dark in that station, because I practice taught during the winter quarter. And I was scared to death until my dad got there. But I got through it. I lost twenty-three pounds during practice teaching because I often slept only three hours a night because of all the preparation and travel. But I made it.  Ms. Paul: You were doing student teaching in kindergarten or first grade?  Ms. Hendry: I was doing second grade student teaching. Kindergarten/Primary  meant preschool through fourth grade. So you could be assigned anywhere in there. My teacher at Red Bank and my school there were marvelous. They had not had a Black teacher over there, either.  Ms. Paul: What school was that?  Ms. Hendry: Oakland Street School. It is now a restaurant. And my cooperating teacher, Mrs. Narry, is now in the senior citizen's development. We became connected again about two years ago, through my brother, Walter, who taught her the mature driving course. When he announced himself as the instructor, she asked if he knew me. He told her that was his sister. She told him who she was and asked all about me. So we connected again. A year ago, we had lunch together in the Oakland Street School Restaurant, in the space that once was our classroom. So you see, life just really binds together. Mrs. Narry came down with appendicitis in the third week of practice teaching. And she had to be removed from the room, of course, because she had surgery. They had a substitute who had never subbed in the primary grades. Therefore, Mrs. Jordan, who was the principal, called me and asked me to take over the class. She said they'd give me all the support I needed. Usually with practice teaching, you didn't take over the class until the fourth or fifth week. But the third week, I took over the class. The children were marvelous! The substitute teacher let me do anything I wanted to do. There was another one of my classmates named Geneva Height. She taught in Red Bank, as well. And whenever our advisor from college was coming to observe us, Geneva would call and let me know if she went to visit her first. She would call the office and tell them to tell me she had a red pencil for me. That was the signal that the advisor was in town and coming my way. (laughter) So I would get myself together. Then if the advisor got to me first, I'd call her school and leave the same message. That's the way we connected. That's how bonded our class was, to see that each of us succeeded and that we lost no more of us. The experience at Red Bank was a marvelous one. We had an end-of-the-quarter exhibit and play for the parents, and they just loved it. My report back to the college was glowing, and the advisor said she never thought she'd see me teach, but that I was doing it. That was a compliment and a half!  Ms. Paul: So when you graduated, what did you do?  Ms. Hendry: This was another example of the twentieth century. I was scheduled to graduate in 1951. All of us, of course, were sending out applications by 1950 for openings. I was invited to come back to Freehold to teach in the integrated school here, Court Street School. Freehold had built a new school, the Intermediate School on Park Avenue. And I said I would love to come back and teach in my own community. And I asked if I could teach at the Intermediate School because I knew there were some vacancies. And they said no, they wanted me to teach at Court Street School. Well, I think in my mind, I thought no one was going to do that to me again. So I said thank you and would let them know. Howell Township was another place that invited me to come. But Howell, in my mind and experience, had been a less than welcoming situation. I wasn't sure I was ready for that. Roosevelt, out near Hightstown, was a little community that also invited me. But transportation would have been a problem. I did not drive at all, and there was no public transportation to go out to Roosevelt. But I did love the surroundings and the school. The Board of Education members who interviewed me were very kind, but I thought I'd better not teach there because I wasn't sure how I could get there. But Hamilton Township, New Jersey, sent a representative to the college, who was the Elementary Curriculum Supervisor. They described that they wanted to integrate their system and their staff, and Bertha Lawrence recommended me for the position. She felt I would be a good one to do it. And I thought, "Not again."  Ms. Paul: You were tired of carrying flags, I guess. (laughter)  Ms. Hendry: But this supervisor, Mrs. Johnson, was so down to earth. And she did not mince her words, but she was kind with her words. She said it would be a challenge, and that word always did motivate me. When you use the word "challenge," I am motivated. So I said I would do it. She said the reason she came out to the college to interview me was because she could not really afford to have me come there and be seen being interviewed. And I said that was perfectly all right. Then I got a letter in the mail, and I guess she had the power to do the hiring, salary, and all of that. The salary was $1800 a year. To me it sounded like a gold mine. I hadn't ever made that much. I had done domestic work during college, but I hadn't had a job like that. So I went to Hamilton Township. One of the church members at Mount Zion in Trenton, which was a part of our denomination, recommended a home in which I could live. And it was only two blocks from the school, so I could walk to school. The home was the home of Mr. and Mrs. Payne, and they were marvelous to me. They just adopted me as their daughter, treated me as their daughter, and spoiled me as their daughter. They made it a very nice situation for me to go to and from their house to school. And so I taught there for eight years. The first day was horrible. I had gone to Hamilton Township to move in, to go to the school to get my room all fixed up, and to meet the principal.  Ms. Paul: What grade?  Ms. Hendry: First grade. So I did all that ahead of time. The day school started, the youngsters came in, and I had only one Black child in class. They had grouped their children according to the top, middle, and bottom of the class. It was a primary school, which I loved. It was kindergarten through fourth grade only. But the parents who brought their children to school were not sure they wanted to leave them with me. Children were crying, many of them. And the parents were outside the classroom door, not feeling very comfortable. And the principal was walking back and forth, wondering how I was going to control this whole situation. So I opened the door, and one parent said, "Would you get the teacher?" I said, "I am the teacher." She said she thought I was just watching the children until the teacher came. I told her to see the principal, who would tell them I was the teacher. The principal came into the classroom, and I asked her what I should do. And she looked at me and said, "Handle it." And then she turned around and walked out. So I said to the parents, "If you would just entrust your children to me today, we'll talk about the situation tomorrow. I must get them settled down now, because the school day has begun." And I closed the door. The parents were outside the door, and I just took all of my nerve, went over to my desk, picked up a few books, and dropped them to the floor. And the noise quieted the kids. And I said, "Now, I don't want to hear any more noise out of you. If you don't want to hear the noise of these books, I don't want to hear your noise. My name is Lillie Ham, and I would like to know each of your names." And they quieted down. I got on with my day, and one by one the parents left. We sang, clapped hands, kept rhythm with our feet, and we enjoyed our time together. And the next day, the parents brought their children back to school. They still stood outside my door, but they didn't make any noise about me having their children. And the kids were fine. I got into the school year. I was the second Black teacher hired there. They had hired a man the February before, and he was very supportive. He said he knew what I had to go through, and he was here to help me. So it all worked out, and I was there for seven years. Then I received the honor of going to England to teach, under the Fullbright Scholarship. It was the Fullbright Exchange  Teaching Program. I had gone for that interview, and I took my baby sister Wilma with me. I didn't tell my parents anything about it, because they would have had a fit if they thought I was going three thousand miles away.  Ms. Paul: And you took your hat and gloves too, right?  Ms. Hendry: No, I didn't take those. (laughter) For my first interview, I was under the impression that I was on a list with others. They had to get my credentials, my records, and do a character check, because it comes out of Washington. And it's amazing what they do with a character check. It scared me then. They did all of that, and they told me I was on a list. If I was accepted, finally approved, and Congress approved it, then I would go within the next five years. And I thought that was fine, because I would have lots of time to prepare my books. Huh! I went the next year. I went for three interviews. One was in Jersey City, one was in Trenton, and one was in Philadelphia. And my baby sister Wilma went with me, but nobody else knew. Then in February, I got the letter that I was to go in August. And I had to say yes or no. Well I couldn't make that decision without consulting the family. So then I had to let everybody know, and we talked it over and over. I had to let them know by the end of March. Well, I finally let them know that I could go.  Ms. Paul: That's so exciting! You must have developed a lot of self confidence in the meantime, from a girl who didn't want to go away to college to somebody who was going to go to England.  Ms. Hendry: Yes, but it was a challenge.  Ms. Paul: So where did you go?  Ms. Hendry: Just outside London, in Middlesex County. It was a fabulous year. I lived with a British family, with whom I still communicate. I taught in three English schools and lectured in four more. And it was just wonderful. I didn't want to come home, I actually wanted my family to move over there with me. It was just an altogether different atmosphere to be in. I was with a family that had never had any association with a Black person before. But they were so loving and unquestioning. They had no preconceived notions. And I was in a school that was just fascinated with the fact that there was an American there, not a Black American, but an American. And I really felt American before I felt Black, which is an experience I had never had here. So it was just very different. And then traveling was so easy, getting from different cultures and different people and seeing their likeness and differences. I couldn't do that here with any comfort. So it was really a very, worthwhile, growing year. One time my mom said I may have grown out of my britches because I came back expecting much more of the surroundings than I had expected before, and almost diplomatically demanding more. And I started advising others how to get more. I could have come back a rebel  however, I didn't. I just felt I was blessed, and I should share the blessings. And if they were truly blessings and shared, they wouldn't be rebellious. So I came back after that year. A teacher from England had taught in my stead, here. She had met my family and come to visit my town, as I had gotten to know hers. So it was a wonderful exchange experience. However, I found when I got back to my school in Hamilton, jealousies had arisen from top to bottom. Why should I have had that experience? Well, all I did was to share my experience with the PTA and the children. My family had been gracious enough to scrape together pennies to buy me an 8mm motion picture camera so that I could take pictures of everything to bring back to share with everybody. I think I had a thousand feet of film that I shared with PTAs, church groups, and with everybody. And that way, everybody was included in my experience. And the jealousies disappeared. And the experience was wonderful when I was teaching Social Studies to my children. So it was a good year, which I am still sharing in many ways.  Ms. Paul: So you went back to Hamilton?  Ms. Hendry: Yes. That was the agreement. If your system allows you to go, then you must return to them. And I didn't mind returning. I liked my school. But then my mother became very ill, and we all took off time to be with her. She left us, and of course she also left my dad. So then I had to make a decision. My itchy feet were still itchy, and I still wanted to travel and have new experiences in other places. But I had to sit down and talk to myself very, very hard. I decided I would be in Freehold to stay. Before my mom passed away, we had planned to build a new home for her and my dad. After she passed away, I had to make the decision as to whether or not to go through with that. I decided to do that, because they, Mother and Dad, had both been a part of the beginning. So we built a new home, and once there was a home, here I am. I applied here, to Freehold Borough School System again, and this time they let me go to the Intermediate School. And that was a very good experience.  Ms. Paul: When was that?  Ms. Hendry: That was in 1960. Of course many of the teachers there knew me, because some of them had come from the high school when the Regional began. The year I was in England, the high school district regionalized. The teachers were given a choice of staying with the regional district or coming with the elementary district.  Ms. Paul: Oh, I never even thought about that.  Ms. Hendry: So some of them came to the elementary school district, and some of them stayed with the high school district. Many of the teachers were new to the elementary school district. They became my co-workers. Two of them had been my high school teachers. My principal had been my teacher at the high school. He said he was so glad I was there. He said he was hoping I would come. And we worked hand in glove. I had never taught sixth grade. I came into the Borough teaching sixth through eighth grade Social Studies and English. It was a middle stream, because classes were homogeneously grouped in what we called developmental classes, which are now resource classes. I wrote the curriculum for my developmental class, and I insisted that I keep the same class through all three grades so I could complete that curriculum with them. My youngsters and I bonded. Joseph Summers, who was superintendent, wanted their guidance department program in the elementary school to be developed, which was not very popular then. It just wasn't well-known at the elementary level, you know. So we worked together on the elementary school guidance program, and I became the counselor, in addition to my teaching assignment. And that was a very heavy load. But it worked. Every eighth grader who left that school had to come to my classroom. I made sure that they had what the high school needed, as well as the life skills that I had been taught in Court Street School. They had been successful for me. The guidance program was one of the highlighted ones in New Jersey, and we had many people come to observe it. I had a group of youngsters for whom I was almost a second parent. They all said they would miss me when they had to go to high school. Ironically, my advisor from high school days had become a guidance counselor when the program came to the regional school. She called me one day and told me she was retiring. She said there was nothing she would like better than for me to take her place. I just didn't know what to say, except to thank her for her offer. I told her I didn't think she could hire me, and she said she had already talked with the principal about it. And so I told her if the district wanted me, I would come. I got in touch with my sister Nicy and told her I was going to the high school, and that the elementary system needed to replace me there. She had been working in the system during summers, anyway, with their summer school program. So she was acquainted with the setup. I had told them I would only go to Freehold Borough High School, and I didn't want to go to any other high school. I had gone back to college and had gotten my Masters Degree. I had received all my certification for K-12. I never dreamed of doing that when I first started. I thought I would just teach pre-school through fourth grade, that's it. But things developed, and I met the challenges and went on. Well, the summer before I was to start at the high school, they said they needed an experienced person at Marlboro High School, which was a new school opening. And that's how I got to Marlboro. I told them I wanted to be at Freehold Borough, and they said if I agreed to spend that first year at Marlboro, they'd agree to consider taking me back to Freehold Borough after that. I loved Marlboro. But Mr. Schned came in February, and said he had to review our agreement. He wondered if I still wanted it that way. I said I still wanted to go back to Freehold Borough. That's the way I got back to the Borough, where I stayed twenty-one years. I hope I made a difference. That was the whole goal in my life, to make a positive contribution and difference.  Ms. Paul: And you knew from the teachers that you had, what a difference you can make in the life of a child.  Ms. Hendry: Yes. So that's the story of our twentieth century existence up to now. I have been retired for ten years from the Freehold Regional District, having been there as a Guidance Counselor, a Guidance Supervisor, a Counselor in the adult evening programs, and also at Brookdale College in their evening program. Now I am on the Planning Board of Freehold Borough community, and I love watching the community change, develop, and restore. Of course I have my church work at Bethel AME Church with the Scholarship Committee. There is now my pet project, Court Street School Education Community Center, a re-developing movement away from excluding a community to including all communities.  Ms. Russell: We made it "in spite of..." I really feel when I look at the children, like Lillie said, she says she hopes she made a difference, and I hope a little bit of me rubbed off on each of them that passed my way.  Ms. Paul: When did you retire, Nicy?  Ms. Russell: 1981. I retired from the Elementary School District in 1981.  Ms. Hendry: But she has never retired from community service.  Ms. Paul: So what are you involved in?  Ms. Russell: Right now, I am working with my church, Bethel AME. I am a Trustee, and I took my dad's place on the Board of Trustees.  Ms. Paul: (Laughing) Are these inherited positions?  Ms. Russell: Yes.  Ms. Paul: I guess it works that way.  Ms. Russell: I was the liaison for the building of the new church. I was the person representing the church with the contractor, the lawyers, and all of that.  Ms. Hendry: And with both Freehold Township and both Freehold Borough, since the land is in both, you had to work with both municipalities.  Ms. Russell: So I was the representative from our church for that. We have a cemetery next to Saint Rose of Lima. I worked with that and gave an interview with the Asbury Park Press. This caught the eye of our present Sheriff , and he got his men to get in touch with me from what I had said in that interview. And they cleaned the property off for us. The Boy Scouts working on their Eagle badge came here each year, but they couldn't do as thorough a job as Sheriff Oxley's Office, because they had more equipment with which to do it. They put us in touch with the Marine Corps, who made crosses for the unmarked graves.  Ms. Hendry: Because there are Black soldiers from the Civil War buried there.  Ms. Russell: They built a new sign for us, and that was part of my community church work. I'm on the Scholarship Committee and the Kitchen Committee. And the reason I am on the Kitchen Committee is our aunt had left money to the church building fund. Since I was the one that was coordinating the building and whatever, I put it towards the kitchen. We didn't have a kitchen, dining room or all-purpose room before that. I took my mother's spot on the Stewardess Board. I really didn't want to be a part of it, because I didn't think I was qualified. But others in the church persuaded me, so I took her place on that. I had a very nice thing that happened to me. Our overall church, where they have the connection at the top with the bishops,  contacted me three different times asking me to send them my biography. I had been putting it off. Lillie told me if I would write it, she would get it typed for me and send it in. They have what they call the AME Registry Select. It has the life of the bishops, general officers, and other members they want to recognize.  Ms. Hendry: People who have made outstanding contributions to the church, in talent and service.  Ms. Russell: So Lillie got it typed for me, so I'm in the AME Registry Select, the first copy…my whole history. Last Saturday, I was also honored by the New Jersey Conference Lay Organization. They are the ones that take all the churches in the State of New Jersey and honor the unsung heroes. And I was honored. I received a lovely certificate for my work with the church and my community. I also received a plaque and cards. And in the cards I received some checks.  Ms. Hendry: And she walked away with a whole lot of flowers. (laughter)  Ms. Russell: And a big bouquet of roses, and another separate rose and a corsage.  Ms. Hendry: She was really overwhelmed Saturday.  Ms. Russell: The pastor is on vacation, and he and his wife sent me the corsage.  Ms. Paul: Oh, that's lovely.  Ms. Russell: I had organized the lay organization in our local church. Last summer when I got sick, the vice president had to take over. And she sent me the nicest card and said I had made such a difference. The way I had left things made it easy for her to take over. She said how much she appreciated it and the support I had given her. She said I was her mentor. It brought tears to my eyes.  Ms. Paul: That's wonderful, it really is.  Ms. Hendry: The twentieth century for us, was an ever-developing time. There were eight of us, and there were developments in all of our lives. This meant our whole family history in this community was ongoing…the community itself, the people, the atmosphere and its changes. And I think you can see how the atmosphere changed according to the times and in our lives. And it's still changing in the lives of the younger people.  Ms. Paul: You gave me a tour of the Court Street School before we started. But we haven't really, for this program, talked about something. Was the school integrated in 1947?  Ms. Hendry: 1949.  Ms. Paul: It became integrated in 1949 and then was a school until 1971?  Ms. Hendry: Yes.  Ms. Paul: And then it was closed down in 1971. And was it empty most of that time?  Ms. Hendry: For a short time the building became the Freehold Borough's Administration Building. Then the building was sold to Monmouth County. The Probation Department was to be located in the west wing of the new Court House. While the West Wing was being built, the Probation Department was located at the Court Street School building because it was a county building. And it still is owned by the County but leased to the Board of Trustees of the Court Street School Education Community Center for a dollar a year for the next fifty years.  Ms. Paul: So when was your Community Center really started?  Ms. Hendry: 1997. The restoration of the school proper…let me see if I can get it straight for you. In 1990 the Center was incorporated. In 1991 we signed a fifty-year lease for rental with the Board of Freeholders of Monmouth County. In 1992 we received a wonderful grant for the restoration design plan for the Court Street School. In February of 1993, the New Jersey Historic Trust gave us a grant for the restoration of the school. Monmouth County Board of Freeholders gave us another grant in November 1993. In February 1994, the Black United Fund approved another grant for general support of the renovation. And in the summer of 1995, the school restoration was nearly completed. By 1997, all of the contracts were completed, plus all of the approvals. Then we opened for programs in the fall of 1997. We restored the school as a tribute to its unique role in the history of Freehold. And we still have our dream of bringing together various peoples, groups, cultures, and organizations in a common cause. And we have the challenge to use the Court Street School as a center for providing a variety of services for all of the people in the community of Freehold.  Ms. Paul: So it really functions as a museum in one sense, but a very active community center in another sense. It has kind of a dual role, then.  Ms. Hendry: We don't call it a museum. We call it a historic site. We have one room in the building which is preserved historically. It has its original floors and the original wood design. The lamps that we have in the entire building are designed according to photographs. The room itself has a dedication area, to the teachers who served here for so many years. It also has pictures of some of the classes from the 1940s. The school also has been redesigned for community use, such as a computer lab for workshops and programs, one of which is the after school homework assistance program for youngsters preschool through seventh grade. Children come after school from four to six on Mondays and Wednesdays each week to be tutored by volunteers. The operation here at the school is completely volunteer. There is no paid staff. We exist on funds that are donations from various auxiliaries, organizations, and individuals. And those donations have kept us going so that we have the program for after school homework assistance, and we also have a program for the Hispanic population of the community to learn better English communication skills. And that program is a special one, because it also involves high school students from the foreign language department at the high school. They give up an evening/week to come here and help facilitate the English language with Hispanic citizens of the community. It's a two-way program in that the Hispanic citizens also help the high school students with their Spanish. Also we have a program with the Dunbar Repertory Theatre, which comes to give us services with our youngsters in dramatic arts. We also have a program with an artist, a muralist, who helped our youngsters with creative arts and painting a historic mural in the basement of the school. It depicts the history of the school from 1921 through 1997, when the building was opened. We have a program that we had with the Floyd's Club of Monmouth County on environmental science, a summer camp whereby the Floyd's Club youngsters help younger people from our community study environmental conservation. We have a computer program for the community, which conducts periodic workshops on Saturday mornings, and it's open to the entire community. And we have volunteers who come in and help with computer skills. We have had donations of computers, which help us to facilitate that program. So we are involved in several programs for the community, but by far, we hope to be involved in more when we have the facility for funding.  Ms. Paul: You said Summit Bank had just given you some furniture.  Ms. Hendry: Yes, Summit Bank has been very supportive with our programs, and they have donated furniture for our buildings, for our offices. They also donated computers for us, and their staff has donated many volunteer hours to help our youngsters with computer skills and also our community workshops. We also have the Pioneers of Lucent Technology, who have helped to maintain the appearance of the building. They have spent Saturdays with us in painting the outside of the building, the façade, and also with renewing the paint inside. They have also cleaned our carpets and done other services for us. We have various groups, such as United Black Families of Freehold Township, who have been constant supporters, both with volunteers and with financial support for our programs here. Also the Women's Club of Freehold Township has donated books for our youngsters and supplies. The Molly Pitcher Women's Club has donated books and supplies for our youngsters' programs in computer and in homework assist. We had many parents who have donated volunteer time to spend with our programs, as well as friends from as far away as Keyport. They have come into the school because they feel that the programs here that service the youngsters are certainly worth their volunteer time. The Presbytery of Monmouth County has also contributed to the Center's Community Self-Help Nutrition program.  Ms. Paul: That's wonderful.  Ms. Hendry: There is more that we would like to do for the community. We would like to have an administrator, possibly an assistant administrator or community coordinator, and also a part-time clerical staff so that we might be able to expand the services for the community. The facility is a marvelous one, and it really should be used fully. So we need the help of people who can see the value of the programs that are here and continue with supporting the youth of the community through financial donations, grants and support. And we hope to get on board an administrator who can facilitate broadening the program.  Ms. Russell: Lillie, did you tell them it's on The Historical Site list?  Ms. Hendry: Yes, I would like to read into the record a letter that we received from Dorothy P. Grozzo, who was Administrator with the State of New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, the Division of Parks and Forestry and the Historic Preservation Office. This was presented to the Court Street School Education Community Center September 11, 1995. It says she is pleased to inform the Education Community Center that the Court Street School, Freehold Borough, Monmouth County, was entered into the National Registry of Historic Places on October 4, 1995. The National Registry is the official list of cultural resources significant in American history in reference to architecture, engineering or culture. Listing in the National Registry insures that the property is affected by undertakings that are federally executed, licensed or financially assisted and will be subject to review and will always be a National Historic Place. And so we are on the Historic Registry.  Ms. Russell: And that took a lot of time.  Ms. Hendry: From 1982 to 1995.  Ms. Russell: We have gone through all of the old records of the Board of Education to get the information to send to them in order to get it. Lillie and I spent many a night going through the records.  Ms. Paul: Well, the two of you have done marvelous work. I know you said it's with the help of a lot of other people, but you are two people who wanted to make a difference. I don't think there is any question about the difference the two of you have made in the lives of so many people. And I'm just so excited about the chance to spend this afternoon with you. It has just been wonderful.  Ms. Hendry: We have really enjoyed it. Especially I have, that we are reacquainting ourselves after so many years. It has just been a pleasure to see you again, to talk with you again, and to share with you again.  Ms. Paul: It's been wonderful. Thank you both so much.  Ms. Russell: Thank you for coming.  
MonmouthCounty;Helene Moore;1923;2000;Helene Moore, 1923, 2000        Remembering the 20th Century: an Oral History of Monmouth County      Helene Moore, May 2000  Date of Interview: September 25, 1999  Name of Interviewer: Flora Higgins  Premises of Interview: Colts Neck, NJ  Birthdate of Subject: July 5, 1923    Ms. Higgins: Good afternoon, Helene, or I might as well come up front and call you Pete, because we've been friends for a long time.  I'm very glad you're here today with us to be interviewed.    Ms. Moore: Thank you, Flora.  I'm delighted to be here. I hope I can help you.    Ms. Higgins: You came down to Monmouth County when it was still very rural.  Please tell us a little bit about what Middletown looked like, and maybe New Monmouth, which is where you settled.    Ms. Moore: When we arrived in New Monmouth in 1950, it consisted of a grocery store, a Baptist church, and a Catholic church.  We bought a fifty-five acre farm from a Polish farmer and his family because we thought it would be a wonderful place to raise children.  It was a garden or truck farming area and extremely rural. Our farm consisted of a peach orchard and an apple orchard, open fields and also a wooded area where the children occasionally liked to play. It was actually a delightful place to raise children.    Ms. Higgins: How long did the rural environment last?    Ms. Moore: Oh, approximately ten years.  I'm not entirely sure  that's purely a guess. Developers started buying up land and building and they built all around us. We were pretty much surrounded by ranch houses and split-levels, and of course the whole nature of the scenery changed. Not for the best unfortunately.    Ms. Higgins: The schools must have taken a heavy impact with the population influx.    Ms. Moore: They really did. The schools had to enlarge, and I believe there was some new building.  The whole character and personality of the place changed. I didn't particularly like it, but it certainly was better than living in the city, and we still had our land to enjoy for a period of time.    Ms. Higgins: Was your house old, as well?    The historic farmhouse at 23 Morford Road, as it looked before 1915. The photo was given to the Moore family by the late Wilbur and Agnes Roberts of New Monmouth.    Ms. Moore: Our house was quite old.  It consisted of a very, very old portion and an addition that had been built sometime in the middle of the 19th century, which had rather high stately ceilings and large rooms.  We remodeled it.  We did most of our work in the old portion, which  had the original wavy leaded windows.  And the fireplace in the kitchen was large enough to hang huge pots and kettles in -- I'm sure they did all their cooking there. Unfortunately, it was crumbling and we finally had to demolish it for safety's sake.    Ms. Higgins: Was there any kind of culture clash between the sort of idyllic, rural fifty-five acres and then all the people coming into the split levels and the ranch houses?    Ms. Moore: Yes, because the new people coming in were a totally different type than the old timers who had been there when we first arrived. They brought with them the values of city life. They were very, very proprietary about their small lots, which we found very amusing.  Many of them were very annoyed at us because we had animals -- horses, cows, goats, sheep, chickens, ducks and geese.  Of course, horses and cows and other animals are not particularly cognizant of property lines.  Occasionally we would have mishaps and some of the split level and ranch house dwellers were not very understanding about it. The horses and cows occasionally went loose. They had an unfortunate habit once in a while of breeding in plain view out in the fields. And of course, some of our lovely people from Newark and New York had led rather sheltered lives, shall we say, and they were very upset to have their children witness the realities of life.  So we had a few problems with neighbors, I'll have to admit.    Ms. Higgins: You and your husband were active in politics.  Was it a Republican or Democratic area?  How did you find the scene when you came?    Ms. Moore: When we first arrived I would say it was 99% Republican.  If there were any Democrats, we failed to unearth them.  We were very liberal minded and very, very long time Democrats, both of us. And we found that a little bit difficult  one had to guard one's social conversation. I even was a little leery when I first registered to vote because all the people at the registration table were long-time Republicans and solid citizens of the community, but I managed to screw up my courage and register as a Democrat.    Ms. Higgins: There were some powerful Democrats eventually.  Did you work with Matt Gill?    Ms. Moore: Matt became a personal friend of ours. As a matter of fact, it was he who sold us our farm, and he used to drop in once in a while, and he would invite us to his place.  We were never close friends but we saw him from time to time socially.    Ms. Higgins: He was Mr. Democrat in Middletown. When you got yourself into some kind of employment situation, where did you work?    Ms. Moore: When the children were small that was a problem. I wasn't exactly a born housewife, and I did want to go back to work as soon as I could. So obviously the most logical thing to do was teach, because then my hours would be the same as my children's. So I checked one day at the Board of Education -- I thought I might be hired as a substitute. They were in the throes of a teacher shortage, which I didn't know  I had just stumbled into the situation.  When they discovered I had a degree, they asked if I would teach full time. It had never occurred to me to work full time and I discussed it with my husband. The upshot was that I accepted a job teaching first grade in the Navesink School, which was extremely small at the time. We had IQs from 60 to 180, and it was a very difficult class to teach because the range of intelligence was incredible.    Ms. Higgins: When you were teaching there, did you notice a lot of tension between the school board and the teachers?    Ms. Moore: No, I didn't.  I don't think I was particularly interested in community affairs, and I suppose I was totally unaware of the situation with the Board of Education.     Ms. Higgins: Were you there when the Middletown Public Library was built on New Monmouth Road?    Ms. Moore: I think I was no longer there.  I have very vivid memories of the tiny library on King's Highway, and it was charming.  We took the children there and introduced them to reading as much as we could.    Ms. Higgins: Where did you go to work when you were finished teaching?    Ms. Moore: I was trained to be a journalist, I had newspaper experience before I became a mother, and it was my ambition to return to my field. After I had taught at Navesink School for two years, the Lifestyle editor of The Red Bank Register left her job and it was offered to me.  I was just delighted to accept, and then, of course, my life changed a great deal.    Ms. Higgins: Was that paper based in Red Bank at the time? Their building is out on Route 35 now, but where did you go to work everyday?    Ms. Moore: There was a small three-story building on Broad Street near Reussille's Jewelry Store. It was quite an old building.  It had a tin ceiling and old gas fixtures, which had never been removed. There was no elevator -- we ran up and down the stairs dozens of times a day. The editorial offices were on the third floor. And the wire machines and the composing room were downstairs, so we had plenty of exercise.    Ms. Higgins: Who was the editor then?    Ms. Moore: In the late 1950s, the editor was James Hogan, a big, burly, gray-headed Irishman and I remember my first run-in with him.  I had been there one week and I misspelled Katharine Hepburn's first name, which is spelled with an "a" instead of an "e" and he struck the fear of God into me and of course I was very, very careful after that. The managing editor was Art Kamin who eventually became editor. And there were some wonderful old newspapermen there. Tom Bly and Bill Sandford come to mind. It was a small staff, but a great group of people.    Ms. Higgins: It was the only paper in town at the time as I understand it.  Of course the Middletown paper came later, but The Register was the paper everyone had to read.  People now do a lot of complaining about parking in Red Bank.  Was it easy to park in the 1950s and early 1960s?    Ms. Moore: I remember that we parked west of the office. Behind the building there was a large city parking lot, but there were meters in each parking place. There was no way you could put in more than a quarter, so we had to keep running out all day to feed the meter.    Ms. Higgins: And down the three flights of stairs.    Ms. Moore: And out the back, no matter what the weather -- it could be snowing, it could be freezing, but we had to feed the meter. Once I put a note on the meter in an attempt to excuse myself from all the running. Next weekend a policeman appeared at the back door of my home as I was in the kitchen fixing lunch for my four children. He was totally serious and wanted to haul me back to Red Bank to the police station or to jail. I told him, "I can hardly leave four small children all alone here." I suggested bringing them all in with us -- runny noses, diapers, and all -- and he speedily decided to drop the whole idea..    Ms. Higgins: That's a wonderful story. Parking has always been a bone of contention in Red Bank, and I see it was just as bad a few decades ago. When you eventually moved on from that Lifestyle page, what else did you cover then?    In the early 1960s, Helene Moore, woman's editor of The Daily Register, accepts an award from the late Harold Kelly, publisher (left), and Art Kamin, editor    Ms. Moore: I was always Lifestyle editor. I worked for The Register for ten years in that capacity and I always wanted to move to the main copy desk and handle hard news. There were three or four men staffing that desk.  I was totally capable of doing the work (and later did just that for thirty years at The Miami Herald) but I was a woman, alas, so it wasn't even considered.    Ms. Higgins: Can you tell us some of the things you covered? What stands out in your mind that you may have covered as Lifestyle editor?    Ms. Moore: The original job title was Society Editor, and it involved weddings, engagements, tea parties and so forth. I thought the format was archaic, and I created a real lifestyle section with features about home, women and children and tried to broaden the scope and introduce family issues. I changed the makeup from the old vertical style with one-column photos to a splashier, horizontal makeup using larger, more striking  photographs. And, of course, covering a much wider range of interest. And it worked pretty well  we won several statewide journalism awards.    Ms. Higgins: One of the institutions in the county is of course the Monmouth Hunt. Can you tell us something about the early days of the Monmouth Hunt?    Ms. Moore: It was a very exciting thing. We used to have a station wagon. And we would take all the children and pack a great picnic lunch and find a wonderful parking place in a lovely area with rolling hills and lots of trees. We'd pull down the tailgate and spread out a feast.  It was mostly steeplechase racing, as I recall. It was really wonderfully exciting. The children and I looked forward to it every year.    Ms. Higgins: It's quite an expensive outing now.  Back in the early days, it sounds as if it was much simpler.    Ms. Moore: We never thought of it as a social event -- it was just a fun family-community kind of thing to do.    Ms. Higgins: When you had finished a day's work, how did you amuse yourself? What cultural things were available in Monmouth County at that time?    Ms. Moore: Not many as I recall.  There was a movie theater eventually on Route 35, which was not too far from where we lived, but we rarely went there. As the children  entered their teen years, I think they would go up there sometimes by themselves. We would occasionally have live theater.  I remember a D'Oyly Carte Opera Company coming to Red Bank with Gilbert and Sullivan's HMS Pinafore. I took my daughter, Christiana, who was bored to tears and escaped to the back of the theater. I remember once taking my youngest boy, Lewis, to the Boston Symphony. Occasionally, we had something like that but not terribly frequently.    Ms. Higgins: Where? Where would they play?    Ms. Moore: At the film theater in town.    Ms. Higgins: Was that the Carlton?    Ms. Moore: Yes, that sounds so familiar.    Ms. Higgins: It was a Walter Reade theater?    Ms. Moore: Yes, I think so.  I haven't thought of that in years.    Ms. Higgins: Walter Reade was the developer of a huge chain of theaters and his wife, Harriet Reade, was very instrumental in the Democratic party. Can you tell us something about Harriet Reade?  Do you remember her?    Ms. Moore: I remember her. I was never a close friend , but I went to Democratic Party meetings at her home, which was on Navesink River Road.  She was very friendly and an intelligent woman. I never really knew her well but met her occasionally at teas and dances and similar events.    Ms. Higgins:  I didn't realize they had live theater in that building as well, which of course now is Count Basie Theater.  I should explain for persons reading this interview that Mrs. Moore lived in Monmouth County from 1950 through 1968, so this interview is her recollections of those times. Speaking of when your children became teenagers, what did the teenagers do to amuse themselves?    The Moore children in front of historic farmhouse. From left to right: Brian, Sean, Lewis, and Christiana.    Ms. Moore: That was a very difficult period in my life.  I had three boys, and I suppose everyone agrees that boys are a little harder to control than girls, and they made friends through their school. They went to a middle school called Thorne School, whose students  came not so much from the Middletown area, but from areas further away.  They became involved with a group of boys that I didn't approve of, so it was difficult. They spent a lot of time hanging out at Campbell's Junction, near Wassermann's, which was a large general store.  Does it still exist, I wonder?    Ms. Higgins: I think it does. I'm not sure.    Ms. Moore: I suppose they smoked and they drank beer and they got into scrapes  nothing terribly serious by today's standards, but upsetting for parents.    Ms. Higgins: They were interesting times to bring teenagers through, and wasn't the Middletown High School built about that time?    Ms. Moore: My children went to Middletown High School, and it was considered a new school at the time.    Ms. Higgins:  I was just interviewing a teacher the other day. She commented on how terribly run down it is now.    Ms. Moore: Oh, no, really? What a pity.    Ms. Higgins:  Hanging out at Campbell's Junction sounds relatively innocent given today's environment.    Ms. Moore:  With what goes on today, absolutely, but I came from a very strict household. I was brought up very strictly by European parents and the scrapes my children got into were shocking to me. Viewed from the perspective of today, they were all pretty innocent. You'd call it mischief now, I suppose.    Ms. Higgins: Can you tell us a little bit about your parents? How did you come to be in Monmouth County in the 20th century?    Ms. Moore: My mother came from the north of France  my father was born in Belgrade, Serbia.  He was a photographer. He came to the United States with his family early in the early 20th century. My mother came about 1908, about ten years or so later. They both made their homes in New York and met there at a party.  My mother  spoke only French, her native language, so the conversation at the party was totally incomprehensible to her.  My father, however, was a linguist. Among his languages was French, so he took her under his wing.  When I grew up I worked as a newspaper reporter and I moved south. I worked for The New Orleans Item at one time, and I met my husband in New Orleans.  He wanted to buy a farm on which to raise our children and that's how we came to Monmouth County.    Ms. Higgins: Then you attended public schools in Manhattan.    Ms. Moore: I attended elementary and high school there and I was graduated from Hunter College, which is part of the city university system.    Ms. Higgins:  I'm trying to understand the cultural milieu of Monmouth County in 1950.  Were there many theater groups? You say you taught in Navesink  was that Navesink Library theater group active at that time? Were there other theater groups? There are a lot of local theater groups now.  I'm trying to understand the history of these groups.    Ms. Moore: I don't think they existed when I first arrived, or if they did, I was not aware of them. When the children were about ten or twelve, I became involved with what was called Little Theater. I don't remember Navesink being part of the name.  I had always loved theater. We put on plays for children and toured the county schools. Occasionally there were roles our productions for children, and we would round up our own children to appear. I remember particularly one in which we needed a lot of trees and shrubs, and so we outfitted the children, including my brood, in Dr. Denton pajamas dyed green.  For those who don't know, those are the pajamas with covered feet. Our children had a wonderful time cavorting around the stage in their Dr. Dentons.    Ms. Higgins: Did you ever act yourself in any of these productions?    Ms. Moore: Oh, yes, I acted in all of them that I possibly could. Eventually, the little theater became headquartered at the Old Mill, which I believe was owned by Mr. Geza DeVegh, who was a charming Hungarian expatriate. He was a true European gentleman. He was  tall and slim and had delightful manners.  He had one of those little, very continental, pencil-thin mustaches, and he was a very courtly person. He was very important in the cultural growth of the community because he fostered cultural events, music, and plays, and so forth. He had this wonderful atmospheric old building in Tinton Falls that he could offer to groups like ours. It was a pretty rickety place. It was ancient and needed a great deal of maintenance.  We performed there and we always rehearsed there.       Ms. Higgins: It's called The Grist Mill now. It still is there on the mill, and one sits there and looks at the water.  Living so close to the seashore, did you take your family to the beach often, and if so, which beach did you go to?    Ms. Moore: I had a friend who lived in Highlands and down at the bottom of the hill, almost under the bridge, there was a little white beach that was very small and not particularly crowded.  We used to take the children swimming there.  Later we went out to Sandy Hook after it opened up, and that was more of a project because then we really had to count heads to keep track of our broods.  But that was a charming spot, with lots of space and surf.        Ms. Higgins:  We weren't doing anything to keep the ocean clean, and what was happening?    Ms. Moore: We were so unsophisticated about conservation, we had no idea what was happening and what the future would bring.    Ms. Higgins: I often think that of all the depressing ecological events of the 20th century  one of the good things is we do seem to have reversed the trend of soiling the water, and waters that were not clean are now clean. We now we have to keep them clean.    Ms. Moore: I think it's a wonderful trend and I hope our children don't forget the lessons that we learned.    Ms. Higgins: We had some famous people in the area who were portrait painters.  Some portrait painters have gone on to become national and even in some cases internationally noted. What was the art scene a few decades ago?    Christiana Moore poses as Middletown artist Mary Sheehan puts finishing touches to her painting of Alice in Wonderland, commissioned in the 1960s.    Ms. Moore: My daughter was painted by Mary Sheehan. Her portrait as Alice in Wonderland hangs in the Middletown Library. She had long blonde hair, and Mary thought she would be the ideal Alice. And she also painted a portrait of my oldest son, Sean, which now hangs in my living room.    Ms. Higgins: Were foreign films available in this area when you came here?     Ms. Moore: I think we went to New York for something like that.  But you know you have to realize that not only were cultural advantages fewer then, but also I lived a very different kind of life. I had four small children who were a year to two years apart in age, and I really didn't have the time to spend enjoying myself, so perhaps I was not aware.    Ms. Higgins: While you were working at the newspaper and while you were active in what we might call "grass roots politics," can you tell us something about the people who went on to become nationally famous?    Ms. Moore: Katherine Elkus White, who became ambassador to Denmark during the Johnson Administration, was mayor of Red Bank and she was very much a local political celebrity. She also came from a moneyed family, and had a beautiful home in Red Bank. She ran for office while I was living there -- was it for Congress? We did a lot of interviews and stories about her. My then husband, Lewis Moore, who was an attorney, became involved in her campaign and drove her a number of times throughout the state to campaign rallies.  I also remember Gov. Bob Meyner and Helen Meyner very well. Helen Meyner was very gracious to the press and once invited a number of women reporters to the governor's mansion and entertained us royally. Harrison Williams, I believe, was running for the U.S. Senate at the time, and we gave what was called a "coffee" for him. This was a very common community political event -- people would hold little get-togethers in their homes and invite neighbors to hear the candidates speak.  Harrison Williams spoke in our living room.  He stood in front of the Adams fireplace, surrounded by chairs. I remember this afternoon particularly, not because Mr. Williams spoke so eloquently, but because one of the local functionaries arrived late, a very large man (I'm being diplomatic), and sat down in the back of the room in an old mahogany Queen Anne chair. He was a very large man, and as he relaxed against the chair's back, there was a resounding crack as the wood splintered.  Everyone froze momentarily, turned and stared, and the poor man was dreadfully embarrassed.    Ms. Higgins: Well, Harrison Williams did go on to become U.S. Senator.  Judge Pat McGann was also coming into his own during that time frame  wasn't he a member of the Democratic Party at the time?    Ms. Moore: Yes, he was a member of the party and very active in it.  I don't remember all the offices he held. He was very well known and very well liked in the community when he was a young attorney.    Ms. Higgins:  Now he is a prominent judge in Monmouth County.  If you have anything you would like to pass on to future generations in the way of advice, what kind of advice would that be?    Ms. Moore: Do you mean to children, teenagers in particular?    Ms. Higgins: Subsequent generations of Americans as we embark upon this new millennium.  You did say you wish we would keep the lessons of learning how to be more wise as far as ecology goes -- things like that.    Ms. Moore:  I'd like to see as many young people as possible get a complete education. I can't over-emphasize the importance of that.  I think it's important for the nation to have an educated citizenry as much as is possible.  I think a return to the search for peace and brotherhood is vital. I'd like to see an end of war, an end to violence, and an end to drugs.    Ms. Higgins: Of course your children grew up watching you and your husband trying to influence the times, as you were then trying to take a part in the political process, and now there is widespread lack of interest in any kind of politics.    Ms. Moore: Since that time we've lost our respect for politicians. We've lost our respect for office holders. I think the Nixon era and Watergate, the Clinton era, and a lot of local politicians have contributed to this phenomenon and it's a great pity. We don't have heroes anymore. We have billion-dollar sports figures. We have rock stars. Do I sound like an old fogey from an ancient generation? But I think it's so true.    Ms. Higgins:  I wish personally we could bring back the era of grass roots politics that was practiced by the Democratic party in Middletown  probably the Republican party as well.        Ms. Moore: The average person participated, and that was a very healthy thing.    Ms. Higgins: And you being hesitant about registering as a Democrat  showed there was an interest in politics, and an interest in how you reacted with your party and with your candidates. On a more personal level, can you describe any stories or anecdotes that you experienced as a mother or that you remember being passed down from your mother or father?  Anything that happened on the farm that gave a laugh to your family or friends?     Lewis Moore, Jr. pets a new calf on the Moore farm in New Monmouth. The Lone Oak Estates (background) was the former Ralph Morford Farm.    Ms. Moore:  We had a lot of animals. We were not a great livestock farm, but we had a little of this and a little of that. And it was wonderful for the children. We had an old Cadillac that we used  in order to run around the neighborhood -- great transportation for four children and their parents.  We parked it in the driveway one day. I went shopping with a friend, and was gone for maybe an hour or so, and came back to find that one of the children had left one of the rear doors of the Cadillac open. One of the goats was having a great time in the back seat pulling the kapok out of the upholstery and chewing away. We had such a laugh over that. How we could laugh about ruined upholstery in the Cadillac, I don't know, but we always thought that someday if we wrote a memoir, we'd call it the The Goat in the Cadillac.    Ms. Higgins: That's a wonderful story. You remodeled the house.  Were there any stories about that?    Ms. Moore:  I remember pulling down a ceiling in a large recreation room that I suppose was the dining room back in the old days. All kinds of debris emerged out of that ceiling: dry, desiccated cobs of corn, and the corpse of a rat long dead. It was very historical debris!    Ms. Higgins: Your house was how many years old?    Ms. Moore: A  portion of it was about 200 years old, another portion was about 100, and of course I'm speaking of the 1950s.    Ms. Higgins: So you can add almost another fifty years onto that.    Ms. Moore:  I've always wanted to research it, but never got around to it. When we were remodeling the new portion  the walls were noticeably bowed out, so my husband wanted to reconstruct them.  They removed the front wall of the house so that it looked like an old dollhouse with the front panel off and one could peer inside and see all the rooms.    Ms. Higgins: I hope it was during the summertime.    Ms. Moore: Oh, indeed it was. We were open to the elements and were sitting in the dining room with the children around the table. My daughter, who was then maybe eight or nine years old, was seated with her back to the open area where the wall had been removed and behind her was just an expanse of field and meadow .She made the mistake of getting up from the table very suddenly and pushing her chair back, which of course tipped over, and she fell out of the house and landed down in the shrubbery.    Ms. Higgins: Lots of adventures pulling Middletown Township from the 17th century to the 20th.    Ms. Moore: We made a nice-looking house out of it eventually, but it wasn't an easy task.    Ms. Higgins:  When you finished it, did it look colonial?    Ms. Moore: Yes, we tried to keep it as authentic as possible, but we made a number of mistakes.    A 1990s photo of the farmhouse at 23 Morford Road after several renovations    Ms. Higgins: What does the house look like now?    Ms. Moore: It looks very much as we completed it, but some of the subsequent owners made some strange changes.  For instance, it had very colonial -style  rectangular windows.  They removed those and put in large expanses of picture windows, which I'm sure brought a great deal more light and foliage and scenery into the house, but from the outside it looks very, very odd. It's not only no longer authentic, but it's unbalanced and not correctly proportioned.      Ms. Higgins: I wonder if that would be possible now because so many Monmouth County communities have initiated laws that these old houses cannot be changed.    Ms. Moore: Yes, and I wish that something like that could have saved this house, which had a lot of charm.  It was not a comfortable house to live in, but it could have been made to be comfortable.    Ms. Higgins:  If you could make a change in Monmouth County, what would that change be? If you could wave a wand and say this is going to be different in Monmouth County, what do you think you would like to do?       Ms. Moore:  I don't think that's a fair question because I've not lived here since 1968. I've made several visits for maybe three or four days at a time, but I don't think I'm qualified to answer that.    Ms. Higgins: You do know that Money Magazine a year or so ago [1999] voted Monmouth County one of the top three places to live in the country?    Ms. Moore: Yes, I did hear that and I was delighted. I take of a sort of proprietary interest in Monmouth County, as if I had something to do with it, which of course I did not. I'm glad many people have discovered its charms and I hope they won't overpopulate it and ruin it as a result.    Ms. Higgins: It's too late to overpopulate it, it already is, but Monmouth County is still a great place to live.  When you came down Route 35 in 1950, was it a one-lane highway route?    Ms. Moore: Route 35 was a road passing through farm country and if you saw five cars a day on Cherry Tree Farm Road, it was considered busy.  The access to our farm was by Morford Road, which turned off Cherry Tree Farm Road, and it was a very narrow lane.  About half way up it became a dirt lane. It was extremely rural.  I used to look through the kitchen window and watch the children trudge up that lane, past Ralph Morford's farm, after they left the school bus. It was charming.  I'm sure it's completely different now.    Ms. Higgins: Thank you very much for sharing your reminiscences with us.    Ms. Moore: It was a pleasure. 
MonmouthCounty;Helen Thompson;1917;2000;Helen Thompson, 1917, 2000          Remembering the 20th Century: An Oral History of Monmouth County    Date of Interview: April 11, 2000  Name of Interviewer: Joanna Aiken  Premises of Interview: Mrs. Thompson's home, Freehold, NJ  Birthdate of Subject: September 22, 1917    Ms. Aiken: Thank you so much for letting us interview you, Mrs. Thompson. What are your most prominent memories of Monmouth County?      Helen Tela (Thompson) 1936  Mrs. Thompson: As a child, I remember all of the beautiful farm land that we had here. My father died when he was only forty-two, and my mother, of course, had to survive with three children, so we did farm work every summer. When school let out, we went to the farm. My brothers and I would ride on the back of the flatbed truck that took us from the house to the farm, and I remember how beautiful all of the farms looked. The farmer would come to the neighborhood. We'd hop on the truck and we'd go and pick potatoes, raspberries, strawberries, tomatoes, whatever he had to pick, and we earned enough money so that my mother was able to survive for the rest of the year. The widows didn't have the benefits that they have today, but we survived. And that was it. I enjoyed it. I really and truly enjoyed it. My two brothers and I, and many other children in the neighborhood, did just that, and that is how we spent our summer vacations. And then, of course, later on when we went to high school, we always worked at other places like Newberry's or an ice cream parlor. For three summers, I babysat for Dr. Berger's children. He was from New York, but the family used to come here to their summer home in Bergerville. And then, lots of times, I'd go to New York with them, and spend an extended weekend with them if it was a holiday or something. It was so fascinating. They had an enormous impact on my life. It was like I was a big sister, and I will never forget the summers I spent with them. Very nice.    Ms. Aiken: Was there a Newberry's in Freehold?    Mrs. Thompson: Yes. Sure, there was a Newberrys right on West Main Street. The store was where CVS is now.     Ms. Aiken: What is Newberry's?    Mrs. Thompson: Newberry's was a five and ten cent store. That was all before your time. Woolworth's and Newberry's were called five and ten cent stores.    Ms. Aiken: Oh, like a little drug store.    Mrs. Thompson: Well, you didn't get too many things for five or ten cents, but that is what they were called.    Ms. Aiken: What was the famous chain that just closed in New York?    Mrs. Thompson: Woolworth's. Woolworth's and Newberry's were all the same category.    Ms. Aiken: So, you grew up in the Peach Orchard, right?    Mrs. Thompson: Yes, yes.    Ms. Aiken: Can you tell me what exactly what that is?    Mrs. Thompson:  I don't know where they get the name from, but evidently they must have had peach orchards in that section of Freehold. They had apple orchards at Club Place in Freehold, but they didn't call it "Apple Orchard." Nobody seems to know why Texas is called Texas. Mr. Ira Tilton, who was our local historian, tried to find out why that area is called Peach Orchard, but to no avail. And West End is another section. If you lived on Bannard Street in Freehold, or any of the streets in that section, you lived in West End. So, that's it. And if you lived between Haley Street and Rhea Street, you lived in Peach Orchard. We had a very diversified group of people lived there. Mostly Irish and Lithuanian  my people were Lithuanian, and then we had the Negroes. It was a beautifully blended neighborhood. And if it wasn't for our next door neighbor, a Negro family, I don't think we would have survived. They were a fine family. The lady's name was Lavinia Jackson. Living with her were her brothers, one who worked in the Post Office, and one who worked as a glasscutter for Freehold Glass Company. Another brother, Gus, used to be sort of a messenger for Rexall Drug Store, which was on the corner of Main and Throckmorton Street, right by the Episcopal Church. "Especially For You," the florist, is there now. There were five of them all together, and they were all single. Anyway, when my dad died, my mother became a widow at thirty-eight with a history of rheumatic heart, which meant frequent trips to the Monmouth Medical Center in Long Branch. Lavinia Jackson would bring in a chunk of meat that she had roasted, or a pie or a cake, or a kettle of soup, and this was all the time. Among the other "colored" were the Gatlin family. They were very nice people, very nice. The Gatlins later moved to Randolph Street right near the Catholic Church. And we had the Valentine family, the Lewis family, and the Robinson family. And then, of course, we had all the Lithuanians. We had the Gallenouskis, the Sirutis, the Marks, the Bushmans, the Westpenders, the Valencius, the Yoczis, the Globis, and the Shatkus families. These are Lithuanian people in that area.    Ms. Aiken: Is there still a Lithuanian community there?    Mrs. Thompson: No, no. It's mostly now colored, and maybe Hispanic, too. I'm not too sure now. But there are many new houses there and three churches on the street. My house burned down after my mother sold it.  We sold the house to Allan and Julia Sparks.    Ms. Aiken: How did you happen to get here from Lithuania?    Mrs. Thompson: I didn't come here from Lithuania. I was born here in Freehold. But my mother and father were from Lithuania. They lived in the low income housing. When I was just a baby, my mother lost a daughter. There used to be a little bridge there, and Gilbert Colmbs used to have a lumber and coal place where you could buy. I don't remember this myself, but I just visualize what my mother told me. They used to grade potatoes there along the railroad siding. Certain potatoes were too small, and if they fell through the grates, then the children could take those potatoes because that meant they were rejects. Today we call them "gourmet" potatoes. And everyone in the neighborhood used to go there and get their share of potatoes. There was a freakish accident on the rails and that was how my sister was killed.  I don't remember because I was a newborn at the time.     Ms. Aiken: How old was she?    Ms. Thompson: Going on six, just six. A very, very brilliant girl for her age. Very mature, my mother said. She'd walk down the street, and a neighbor would say, "Well, Isabel, how are things at the house?" And she'd say, "Well, you'd have to ask my mother and dad, I don't know." She wouldn't tell them, and she would bring home a large coal piece. My mother would say, "Isabel, why did you bring that? You got your dress all dirty." She'd say, "Well, Mom, it was so cold last year, we could use more coal." Now, my dad was alive at that time, and he worked for the County Road Department. I'm told my mother had a rough time when she lost her daughter, and understandably so.    Ms. Aiken: We were just talking about the different communities in Peach Orchard. You said there was an Irish community as well.    Mrs. Thompson: Yes, the Irish. We had the Dugans, the Daleys, the Kelleys, the Van Schoiks, and the Martins.  Mrs. Norkus was Irish and her husband was Lithuanian. Margaret Malloy was the housekeeper for the Brakely Beanery. The Daley family lived next to the Court Street School.  She, too, was a widow who raised a fine family.    Ms. Aiken: You used to speak Lithuanian?    Mrs. Thompson: Yes. I struggle with it now, because I don't have anyone to speak it with. I have a friend, Helen Mica, who speaks it fluently. I can grasp it, but it is a little hard to communicate, but I try. I used to read and write it. I used to write my mother's letters to people in Europe. They must have understood them because they wrote back. (Laughter) When someone died, in the Lithuanian culture, the body would always be viewed at home. And I remember going with my mother to these various viewings, and my mother had a hymnbook. I still have the hymnbook  it is all in Lithuanian. They used to sing and sing, and I got to the point where I knew all those hymns pretty well. It would be late sometimes. I would be sleepy. They'd put the children off to take a nap and the mothers and fathers would continue singing until about midnight. That was the way they revered and paid respect to the deceased. Lithuanians are very strong Catholics. Of the three Baltic states, and I've heard this before on TV, too, Lithuania was the strongest Catholic nation. My mother used to say that when they were young, they would start out for church on Sundays in the morning, and would be all day getting to church, and they'd go barefoot so that their shoes wouldn't be all dirtied from the road. But they did this to appear neat in church.     Ms. Aiken: How did your parents happen to come to America?      Helen Tela Thompson's mother, 1936  Mrs. Thompson: How did they come? Well, I asked my mother that several times. I said, "Mom, how could you have left your mother?" And she wasn't even eighteen when she came. I think she fudged her age a little bit. And, she said, "Well, my mother said 'go,' because my mother's father came to America in the hopes that he would get a job and be able to support his family and then bring his family over." At that time, I guess, they were allowed to come over without any kind of a problem. My grandfather worked himself into a nice position in the coalmines in Pennsylvania. Now, this is the story that I am told. He was promoted to a foreman position of a team. And there must have been jealousy or envy or something and next thing you know, they say he was accidentally killed, but my mother always said he was probably not killed accidentally. They probably killed him. And they identified him and they traced it down to my grandmother in Europe. And so, that plan fell through, and he couldn't bring his family to America. So my grandmother said there is nothing left for you children to live here for. So, they all left. One daughter left for South America. I understand she went back to Europe in later years. My mother was one of five girls and one boy. Some of them settled in Grand Rapids, Michigan. I have first cousins in Grand Rapids. Her brother, my Uncle Joe, never married, so there were no children there. But Aunt Anna had three children.  And they have quite a lot of offspring. It's a large family. So, we communicate and visit more recently. I asked this one cousin in Europe if she would like to come to America, and she said she had had an only child who died of leukemia and she buried him in Lithuania.  And she said I would never leave him. So that was it. But I have other cousins who wanted to come here also. I started the process, and then in the meantime, Canada opened its doors to all the displaced persons. During the war time most of them lost everything. And they just had to leave, hiding in barns and haystacks and everything to avoid the Nazis. They finally came to Canada. My mother and I visited them. They all live in very attractive homes and have attained success in their positions. They have done very well.     Ms. Aiken: Good.    Mrs. Thompson: Yes. So, they contributed something to Canada. And that was it.  I don't know too much about my father's background. I do remember a beautiful picture of his brother who was an officer in the European Army  he was a handsome man. My father had a sister who came here. She came to Camden, New Jersey. She had a large family, too. I think she had five or six children. They are my first cousins. One of them now is married with seven children. And he never spent five cents on their education but they are all educated. One is a nurse practitioner, another one is an electrical engineer, a nuclear engineer. And another one is a banker. Another one is in the financial market in New York. They are all doing beautifully.     Ms. Aiken: When you and the other children weren't picking the raspberries and the potatoes, how did you play? What kinds of games did you play?      St. Rose of Lima (building no longer exists) around 1931  Mrs. Thompson: Oh, we played marbles. We'd shoot marbles of all descriptions. We played hide and seek, hop scotch, and jump rope. We liked to play baseball and football.    Ms. Aiken: Girls?    Mrs. Thompson: Oh, sure, we played baseball. We played hide and seek and marbles. Oh, marbles were a big thing. We all had big jars of marbles. I wish I had them now.    Ms. Aiken: What was your favorite game to play?    Mrs. Thompson: I don't know. I liked them all. I grew up with two brothers, so I got kicked and hurt. We lived on a farm one time, and I that is how I got a perforated eardrum. My husband used to laugh all the time and say, "Now I know what's wrong with you. Horse kicked you."    Ms. Aiken: Really?    Mrs. Thompson: Yes, he did. I didn't realize it. I was pulling on his tail thinking I could jump up on his back. (Laughter) But, he kicked me, I mean really kicked me. I mean I was unconscious for a long time, out on the field.    Ms. Aiken: It must have been terrifying for your mother.    Mrs. Thompson: Yes, yes, but it all worked out all right.    Ms. Aiken: Did you go to the shore when you were growing up?    Mrs. Thompson: Oh, once in a while, when my dad first learned to drive a car. He died in 1928. He took pride in the fact that he could drive a car. And he took us crabbing down in Keansburg. He knew some friends down there. And every once in a while we'd go on the beach. And, of course, years later, we all liked going down to the shore. But not anymore  I don't care for the shore, now.      George Tela (Helen's brother), circa 1936  Ms. Aiken: Do you remember going around in a horse carriage before you had the car?    Mrs. Thompson: When we lived in Tennent, my older brother, George, became very ill with scarlet fever, and my mother called for Dr. Applegate in Englishtown. She also called for Monsignor Kivelitz, formerly the Pastor of the Rose of Lima Church in Freehold.  And who do you think was the first to respond? Monsignor Kivelitz in his horse and buggy.    Ms. Aiken: Oh, dear!    Ms. Thompson: Oh, yes. Well, my home in Tennent also burned to the ground. This is the way I understand how it happened: the ceilings were low, and the pipe to the stove was very close to the ceiling, and it became too hot, I guess, and caused a fire. My father had the good sense and the wisdom to throw all of the bedding out the windows. Pillows, blankets, everything he could possibly throw out, and then he lowered the three children on top of the blankets, followed by my mother and himself. And not a one of us had a scratch or a broken bone or anything. All five of us escaped. And I still remember sitting across the roadway and watching the house burn down to the ground. Sad.    Ms. Aiken: You were sad?    Mrs. Thompson: Of course. Then we had nothing, nothing, absolutely nothing left. A woman in Tennent, who lived on Tennent Road, a Mrs. Bogusess took us in and got us started and then we moved here to Freehold. She was related to the Daliks in Freehold. In due time, my parents purchased a house on Avenue A in Freehold--house number seventeen. Ironically, this home also burned down after my mother sold it to Julia and Allan Sparks.     Ms. Aiken: Is there a house there now?    Mrs. Thompson: Presently, there is a Habitat for Humanity house on the site, and it will be occupied by Guggie Lewis' niece. There are now two Habitat for Humanity houses on the street, and three churches.     Ms. Aiken:  What do you remember about the Karagheusian Rug Mill in Freehold?    Mrs. Thompson: Oh, I remember that very well. When I finished school, there was no place you could work unless you went to work in an office where you earned about five dollars a week at the most. I know a friend of mine who worked for Dr. Bill Erickson. I think she earned seven dollars a week, and she even had to supply her own uniform. So, I went to work in the Rug Mill, which many of the girls from high school did, because we made five dollars a day, or more sometimes. It was piecework, winding yarn. You worked hard. I remember one woman saying to me, "Why are you working so hard? You are just a young kid. You don't need to work so hard." I said, "My mother is a widow, she needs the money."    Ms. Aiken: So, did you give all the money to your mother?    Mrs. Thompson: Sure. Always did. I gave all my money to my mother. Unfortunately, I didn't know how to shop, because at that point, I was still working weekends for the Bergers when they'd come here to Bergerville for an extended weekend. If time permitted, I would stay in New York City with them for a day or two. My mother gave me one hundred dollars one day. She said, "Now when you go to New York and you are going to stay there an extra day, I want you to go shopping and buy yourself a nice coat and a few other things to go with it." I shopped around. I couldn't find the coat or anything. I didn't know how to shop. I came home and gave my mother the money back. (Laughter) That's the truth. I'll never forget. Clothes didn't mean that much to me.      Helen Tela Thompson and future husband, Walter Thompson, 1938. They were married June 29, 1940.  Ms. Aiken: How did you meet your husband?    Mrs. Thompson: He was a friend of my brother, George,  who also worked in the Rug Mill. Walter was a weaver on a sixteen quarter loom, and they wove for Radio City, the airlines, and many prominent hotels. You just didn't walk off the street and operate one of those looms--no way. No, it was very complicated. That was what really caused his untimely death, too. When he became ill, the doctor kept saying he had water on the lungs. And so he had diets and all that sort of thing. I was a label reader. He was sick a couple of years before he died. But before he died, I finally found another pulmonary man, and I said, "Let's try this one. There is something wrong. This can't be just water. You're sticking to your diet, you've taken the medicine, and you still have the condition." So the doctor gave my husband some tests.  He said to Walter, "What was your primary job when you were younger?" Walter said, "Well, I worked at the parimutuals at the racetrack and I worked at Fort Monmouth." The doctor asked, "But what did you work at mainly?" My husband said, "I was a rug carpet weaver." "Oh," the doctor said, "now I know what the problem is. That's lint. That's not water."    Ms. Aiken: Fibers?    Mrs. Thompson: It was lint. Now you see when these men worked the four to twelve shift, they worked from eight in the morning until four, and then from four to twelve. By law, they had to have half an hour recreation period. And so with that, what did they do? They'd go outside and have a smoke. The smoking brought this problem along a little quicker. But the main culprit was the rugs, his job. Today, they would have things that would prevent things like this. But, I know on a sunny day if you looked over where the looms were working, you could almost cut a knife through the haze that had formed.    Ms. Aiken: I can well imagine that.    Mrs. Thompson: And many weavers died of the same thing-- lint in their lungs.  Yes, some were using oxygen tanks before they died.    Ms. Aiken: You both eventually worked at Fort Monmouth?    Mrs. Thompson: After the Rug Mill moved to North Carolina, my husband was out of work, of course. And after putting thirty years in the rug mill, there was no severance pay, nothing, absolutely nothing. But he was able to get a job at Fort Monmouth. At that time, I was working at Fort Monmouth, also, and he worked at the Parimutuals at Freehold Raceway. He became a section manager of the Parimutuals. They were in different sections, and his section was adjacent to my office.    Ms. Aiken: How was the commute from Freehold all the way over to Fort Monmouth everyday?    Mrs. Thompson: Colts Neck Road, or Route 537, was still a very beautiful road to travel.  There were still open fields and beautiful pastures, as opposed to the mass building of the mansions today.  I always enjoyed my trip to and from Fort Monmouth  Route 537 was one of the nicest highways to travel.    Ms. Aiken: How did you get there?    Mrs. Thompson: By car, and sometimes car pools. It wasn't bad. It wasn't heavy traffic like we have today. We didn't have that kind of traffic. I mean you had to be careful. One year, I remember we could not travel any speed because for the entire month of February, the roads were completely covered with snow and ice. At one time, I took my eyes off the road for a minute, and my gosh, there was a car in front of me that was facing me. The driver had made a complete turn around due to the icy road conditions.     Ms. Aiken: Wow! Oh my goodness.    Mrs. Thompson: But I never had an accident.    Ms. Aiken: Do you feel winters were colder?    Mrs. Thompson: Somewhat. I think they were. One year, as I said, for the entire month of February there was ice on the road and there was no way they could get that ice off.    Ms. Aiken: What do you remember about the Raceway Track?    Mrs. Thompson: I worked in the office there for five years. Because I had already had the children at that time, I couldn't keep a full-time job. We would only work from about May to September in the office. And, I liked that. I did secretarial work and also trained at Western Union in Asbury Park to learn how to operate the telegraph machine to report to various newspapers the racing results.     Ms. Aiken: Were you here at the Freehold track?    Mrs. Thompson: Yes, Freehold Raceway.    Ms. Aiken: Did you see a lot of famous people?    Mrs. Thompson: Oh yes, we had a lot of famous people, primarily on special days. I remember Rudy Valley coming one day. I'm upstairs in the office looking down at Rudy Valley, and Rudy Valley was making sure his toupee was on. (Laughter) Yes, we had a lot of celebrities there. They used to have celebrities there to attract customers on weekends especially.    Ms. Aiken: Tell us about Larry and Raymond.    Mrs. Thompson: Both of my sons brought me great pleasure.  When growing up, Miss Ivins taught Larry piano-- Raymond had Mr. Starsnick.  Raymond performed with local theater groups, too.  Ms. Ivan lived on the corner of Yard and Main Street. Nolan Higgins and family live there now. I remember going to concerts that Larry would be taking part in. And, Ms. Ivans used to say, "Larry knows his music very well. But, his timing is so bad. Get him a metronome." So, I purchased a metronome. It didn't help much. And then Raymond, he was one of these little fellows that if there was a picnic in anybody's neighborhood, they wanted Raymond there-- he was a real "clown" and thrived on people's laughter.  I used to take both boys to Armed Forces Day. They had Earle Ammunition Day, too. I must backtrack a little bit. In the apartment, we had two ladies: Miss Amelia Waller and Mabel Williams. They lived here for thirteen years. They saw my boys grow up. They were both maiden ladies. Ms. Mabel Williams worked at the New York 5th Avenue Library. She was more than a librarian, and they had books dedicated to her. I found out later that she was once named the Most Outstanding Librarian in the United States. We went to her memorial service. And the woman she always lived with was Amelia Waller. Her brother was a professor at the Rutgers University, and Ms. Waller was a high school principal at Point Pleasant. She had Dr. William Erickson, our local dentist, as one of her pupils at one time. So anyway, they used to watch the children playing in the sandbox. And they'd always say to me, "Raymond is a leader, he is a leader, that little boy of yours." And Larry, he sort of sits back all the time. My husband built that sandbox, a huge sandbox. And we filled it up by having a dump truck full of sand come in the spring. But by the end of the summer, there was no sand left. And that's the truth.    Ms. Aiken: (Laughter)    Mrs. Thompson: That's the truth. The big sandbox had a big platform and they used to ride their trains and their trucks and create situations. And all the kids in the neighborhood were here. I used to take Larry and Raymond on Armed Forces Day and to McGuire Airforce Base, Leonardo, and to Fort Monmouth just because I thought they should have all these things and know a little bit about what's going on in the area. I remember going on the ship in Leonardo, and the captain explained the ship and he explained the equipment. He told all the years that it was operating and all that business. And then he said, "Are there any questions?" And my little Raymond's hand went up. Incidentally, I forgot to tell you. Ms. Williams, the librarian, used to work as a volunteer for the Mobile Library Unit, and at that time, it was located on the corner of Broad Street and Manalapan Avenue. And every week she would come with an arm-full of books for the children for me to read to them. And every week, she'd take them back and bring me a new group of books. So, those children knew Dr. Seuss, Babar the Elephant, and you just name them, and they knew them all. So anyway, when I took him to Leonardo this one time, the captain explained to us the dates of the ship's commission and all that business. And my little Raymond's hand went up and he said, "Now you said that this ship was commissioned on such and such a date. Well, this equipment was not invented until another day." The captain, with a kind of startled look on his face, said, "Well, you're right, son. We put that on later." Raymond asked the captain four good questions, but I was embarrassed at this point. And the captain said to him finally, "You know son, I think you know more about this boat than I do. I think you could take over."    Ms. Aiken: (Laughter) Do you know the name of the boat?    Mrs. Thompson: No, it was one of these boats that bring in cargo or whatever it was. It was at Earle. I will never forget that. We went to the Museum of Natural History in New York when Raymond was a cub scout. He'd spot the brontosaurus and the other dinosaurs. He knew all these things. You see, my two boys were so well read. And then when Raymond started school over at the Catholic school, the teacher called me aside the night when the parents were coming to hear the reports of their children, and she said, "Mrs. Thompson, what I'm going to tell you, I don't want you to repeat to anybody here because they'll think I'm prejudiced." And I said, "What happened?" She said, "Your Raymond is a genius." I said, "Genius? He brings me Cs and Ds. And that's not a genius report." "Ignore the report card. Forget about the report card. He has a brain the likes of which I have never seen," she said. "And I know he is listening to the trucks going by, but I say to him, 'Raymond what was that answer now?' and Raymond has it just like that," she says. "He has it. I have never been able to trap him, never." Unfortunately, he has another biological problem, so his life didn't turn out too good. He went into the service and became a Staff Sergeant in the Air Force and then after twelve years, he left the Service.    Ms. Aiken: Did you see a lot of changes after World War II?    Mrs. Thompson: I guess so. Things were really being speeded up. Of course, by that time, the Karagheusian Rug Mill was moving out of Freehold.    Ms. Aiken: Did you feel that Freehold or Monmouth County was successfully governed during all this speeding up with a lot of people coming to live here and all the changes?    Ms. Thompson: Well, it was gradual. The last ten years was when it has really happened. Oh my goodness, they were coming out of the woodwork. They were leaving the cities and coming here, and I don't blame them in a way. I am on the welcoming committee for my church, which is Saint Rose of Lima. So, when a Sister or Father has a list of newly registered parishioners, I am to call and welcome them. And I ask them, "What made you come here to Freehold?" They said, "We love the town. We just love the town. It seems like such a friendly, nice town that you would want to be a part of." Yes, and really that's what they tell me. And at church too, they said people greet us like we're old neighbors and they like that. The friendliness, they say. I believe we can attribute the friendly part to the new pastor, Father Rich, who had introduced many ways for parishioners to be more friendly and supportive.     Ms. Aiken:  Do you have any specific historical events that have like an impact on your life? Any specific ones like maybe FDR's New Deal Program or anything?      Helen's brother, William Tela, Jr., who served under General George Patton  Mrs. Thompson:  Well, I remember when the Hindenberg blew up in Lakehurst. I happened to be in Bukowsky's butcher shop on Throckmorton Street.  I remember all this traffic on Throckmorton Street and the horns were blowing and the people were rushing out of their homes.  I was only a young child. I found out later that the Hindenberg had collapsed and there were casualties. World War II changed my family structure with both of my brothers and my husband in Europe.  George was a first class boatsman on the lead ship on D-Day.  The ship was not expected to return to the United States, but all of the men survived the ordeal.  My younger brother, Bill, was in the Engineer Corps, rebuilding damaged bridges.  He remembered watching his comrades falling into the river like potato sacks.  Thank God, he too was spared.  My husband, Walter, was fighting in the trenches in Italy.  He was wounded, and they were going to have to amputate his feet, but he was saved by penicillin.  In fact, the doctor that treated him in Europe was his doctor from Freehold, Dr. McDonald.      Ms. Aiken: How about the kidnapping of the Lindbergh baby?    Mrs. Thompson: I remember that, yes, oh yes. That was sad. That was so sad. That beautiful picture of that little boy. And I still wonder if they ever got the right man.    Ms. Aiken: A lot of people do. What were you doing when you heard about Kennedy?    Mrs. Thompson: I was working for the Borough at the time, for my first engineer. I had five engineers during my nineteen-year stay at the Borough. And Mr. Goldberger was the engineer. Mr. Goldberger's plaque is on the hospital wall as well as at the Borough Municipal Building. He was the man who started the planning phase for the hospital. He has since died. He was climbing up the stairs and he said, "We have some very bad news. Did you hear the news?" I said, "No, I haven't heard any news." "President Kennedy was shot." "Ooooh," I said, "Wow." And then, of course, I came home and heard it on the television. Later on we found out he died. That was so sad. He was so admired in spite of a lot of talk, you know, gossip. But he tried to do the best he could for his country.    Ms. Aiken: Yes.    Mrs. Thompson: You know, they talk about the Kennedys, saying they are womanizers and all that sort of thing. With all the wealth, they didn't have to work anywhere, they didn't have to do anything. But, they were civic-minded people and politically inclined    Ms. Aiken: Yes.    Mrs. Thompson: And now, of course, Caroline is the only one left. It was tragic what happened to her brother.    Ms. Aiken:  Yes.    Mrs. Thompson: And there, again, the gossip columns are going crazy about him too. Ridiculous.    Ms. Aiken: It sells papers I guess.    Mrs. Thompson: Yes, it's terrible. 
MonmouthCounty;Helen Marchetti;1925;2000;Helen Marchetti, 1925, 2000        Remembering The 20th Century: An Oral History of Monmouth County    Date of Interview: October 20, 2000  Name of Interviewer: Ellen Williams  Premises of Interview: Ms. Marchetti's home, Atlantic Highlands, NJ  Birthdate of Subject: April 7, 1925    Ms. Marchetti: Thank you very much, Ellen, I'm very happy to be able to give this interview with you today. I have a lot of good childhood memories here in Atlantic Highlands  in fact I was born and raised in Atlantic Highlands, and I still live in the house that I was born in. As far as my memories are concerned, at an early age, one of the things I do remember is the amusement park that we had over here on Bay Avenue. At one time it was just a big open lot from Avenue A all the way to Avenue D. We would look forward to that amusement park opening because they had a scenic railway or rollercoaster, and we would get free rides to shine up the rails that had become corroded from the snow and the bad weather over the wintertime. At the amusement park, the boats would also start to run. The boat that I can remember was the Mandalay, that came right into the park area. Then there would be little trains that ran out there to meet the boat and bring the people in from New York for the day. It was really something to see  there were all types of rides. They used to have marathon dancing over there, and the town really came alive. Atlantic Highlands is really only one square mile, and a lot of the homes that were here in Atlantic were just summer homes. At that time I don't think we had more than 1,000 people, even if that, in Atlantic Highlands. So it meant that in June, once schools closed in New York, everybody would come down and open up their summer homes. Right across the street from where I live we had this hotel which they called the Cresson Hotel, and there again, that was just for the summer. Armenian people would come down and open it up and all the kids in the neighborhood would have homemade ice cream. That was a time when people would make their own homemade ice cream. As I said, there's a lot, lot of memories that I have of the town. Years back you just didn't go to First Avenue all the time. Sunday was the best day to go to First Avenue because you went out for a walk  you walked down to First Avenue with your friends and up through the hills on the other side of town. And there was another thing, too: when we were growing up, First Avenue was the dividing line between the west side of town and the east side of town. We were from the West side of town, and it was a treat to get down there on First Avenue on a Sunday, and then walk through the other side of town, because then people didn't have cars. Everywhere we went we would walk. We had nice beaches here at that time. At the end of Avenue A we had Leslie's Beach and Culcullen's Beach, and there again people from New York who came down by boat would go to those beaches for the day. There were bathhouses there  there was everything that you would really and truly want for your town.    Ms. Williams: Would you say that the community still had an identity, even though it was a summer residence?  Were there enough people here throughout the year that you felt a sense of home, even though most homes were summer homes?    Ms. Marchetti: Oh, definitely! Oh, definitely! There's no place like home in Atlantic Highlands. Believe me when I say that.    Ms. Williams: What was the time period there, Helen?    Ms. Marchetti: That was back in the 1930s. That the park was there.    Ms. Williams: So you were born in the home that we're doing the interview?    Ms. Marchetti: That's right.    Ms. Williams: What year was that?     Ms. Marchetti: 1925. My childhood memories were in the thirties. Prior to that you stayed in your home or you were in your backyard - you just didn't go all over town. My father was a milkman for Sheffield Farms  he worked seven days a week. And it was just my brother, myself, and my mother. My father was a very hard working man. We rode on the milk truck many a time if we were off from school, or on weekends.    Ms. Williams: It must have been fascinating to deliver the milk.    Ms. Marchetti: It was. And my father was a great one for whistling and singing.    Ms. Williams: That's good, made the time pass.    Ms. Marchetti: So all the old songs my brother and I know until this day. Sometimes you'll be out someplace and they'll start singing these different songs, and I can chip right in.    Ms. Williams: Did he play an instrument?    Ms. Marchetti: No. No, he just sang.    Ms. Williams: And you just enjoyed being with him.    Ms. Marchetti: Oh, definitely, definitely! My father was born in Atlantic Highlands, and my grandfather, his father, and my mother were born in Middletown.    Ms. Williams: There's a real family history here…    Ms. Marchetti: It was, really. Nobody strayed in those days, I mean you grew up and you stayed right in the town, you know, that you were born in.    Ms. Williams: Right. And you have a real commitment to the town, your whole life, you've been involved in many civic areas.    Ms. Marchetti: Oh, I have. One of my goals growing up was that I would do whatever I could for the betterment of the town.    Ms. Williams: Right.    Ms. Marchetti: I served on the school board for twenty years, at the Atlantic Highlands Elementary School. I've seen that school come to where it is today, which makes me very, very happy. It's fabulous  it's a very educational school, and it's k through six. Years ago there was a high school here in Atlantic Highlands, but then once people started to move in year round, they converted it into just a k through six  the seventh grade went to Henry Hudson Regional High School. I really and truly wish we could have kept the school in town. I am a firm believer in home rule. I don't care whether it's with the school system or in the town itself. As far as the borough is concerned, I served as a councilwoman in Atlantic Highlands. Even then sometimes they would start with this business of garbage collection, sending it out, or trying to sell our water plant. I fought that for all it was worth. And thank God I did. Anytime a district is a sending district, for whatever it might be, whether it's education, or borough, the sending district always pays, and you really and truly do, you pay right down the line on services, there's no two ways about it. So I'm very happy with the way the town's been run over the years.    Ms. Williams: Right. What were some of the issues, Helen, that you might recall with the school borough? What were some sources of discussion that came up a lot?    Ms. Marchetti: None, really. We were very, very fortunate down here in this school for the time that I've been there, and I'm still there now. I've been President of the Board for almost nine years. We really do not have any problems, and some people may not believe it, but we really and truly don't. We have a very good group of teachers. A lot of the teachers are local, and a lot of them live in town, and they have the town at heart and they want to see everything good for the children. We have no problems with contracts or anything like that. So there's really never been any controversy.    Ms. Williams: As Boro Councilwoman, you mentioned the water plant. Were there other issues about Atlantic Highlands that were on the agenda quite a bit?    Ms. Marchetti: Well, you know, the Council oversees all the different departments like the Police Department and the Harbor, but there again, everyone on these boards lives in the town, so that no matter what the political end of the spectrum was, everybody worked together. Everybody has to run on a different ticket, but it's just the idea that once a person's elected, they forget politics and they go for whatever's best for the town. There's a lot of renovation on First Avenue. The new Borough Hall was built, and the bank was moved into a different location. It used to be the First National Bank, and everybody banked there. And then it went to Fidelity, and so forth, but it's still a very friendly, homey town. When you walk either down First Avenue or down your street you meet up with somebody that you know.    Ms. Williams: Well, that's a real advantage growing up here, knowing the school system, knowing the community. And then you became Mayor, you said, the first female Mayor in Atlantic Highlands.    Ms. Marchetti: I was the first female Mayor of Atlantic Highlands. That was in 1984, and some people have asked were there any problems or anything that really went on. I was the one woman on an all male council, and naturally everybody has discussions and differences of opinion and all that. But we always agreed, before we went to a council meeting, and before they went out of that room, I made sure that everybody was in agreement, because there's nothing worse than getting to the council meeting and sitting up there and arguing back and forth, because then people who came to the meeting wonder, "What is going on here?" A town never survives if you have all that friction. There's no advancement in a town. Just because we don't always agree, there's no reason for anyone to go and work against something. You have to sit and talk about it, and think about it, and then come to a conclusion on it.    Ms. Williams: And it's true, we'd give a bad image if everyone was bickering.    Ms. Marchetti: It certainly would - and you see it going on in a lot of towns. But as I said, there again, in Atlantic Highlands, even though we have some differences, in the end, we do what's best for the town.     Ms. Williams: Well, obviously the interest of the people is your priority, and has been your priority in terms of your service.    Ms. Marchetti: Oh, it has been. I've been involved in a lot of functions in town: the Historical Society, for instance. I've been there now twelve years as President of that  and we've come a long way with our museum. We're very fortunate that the Monmouth County Historical Commission has helped us with our grants and everything. And each year they've given us a matching grant, and we've really come a long way with that building. The house, I should say, is about 105 years old, and The Historical Society has been in existence about twenty-six or twenty-eight years. It's at 22 Prospect Avenue, Atlantic Highlands. We encourage people to come: we're open every Sunday up there from one o'clock to four, and we give tours during the week for any organization that wants to come through. We have a lot of memorabilia up there. We have one room that's just dedicated to Atlantic Highlands. So I've been involved in that. I've been involved in Atlantic Highlands Fire Department Ladies Auxiliary. That comes by nature, because over the years my father was a fireman, starting in 1918, and then my brother became a fireman, and my husband became a fireman, so you can understand why I'm involved. You know, it's like anything else, especially with the Police Department. To me the Police Department is the mainstay of your town, it really and truly is. You can have all the council people, and all committees, but you have to have a good Police Department, and we've been very fortunate over the years to have an excellent Police Department. But there again, we don't go outside looking for people to come in and work in these different departments. We stay right in our own town and pull from our own. Those people have an interest, and they care for the town.    Ms. Williams: Do you have volunteers who've lived here taking people on tours?    Ms. Marchetti: Oh yes, yes. We have about 180 members in the Historical Society, and we meet on the third Wednesday of each month, when we have a speaker and we serve refreshments. We encourage people to come to those meetings, because we like to put things out to the membership to get their ideas and listen to what they want of the museum. We hope more people will join. We're starting more and more to get people to join.    Ms. Williams: Do you have the school trips coming? Do you have the students coming from schools during the week?    Ms. Marchetti: Not yet, but we're going to start, you know, to reach out. It's like everything else: we're strapped for money to a point, and we have to have complete coverage as far as insurance is concerned, God forbid if anybody was to be hurt there. A couple of meetings ago, at a Board of Directors meeting, we were talking about going to the schools and inviting students in. We couldn't do it prior to this, because we didn't have heat in the building. Now we have heat in the building. We worked very, very hard to get it installed, thanks to all the people who sent donations and helped us to install the heat. Now we'll be able to bring the schools in during the winter months.    Ms. Williams: What other types of things do you have on display there? Do people bring their photos?    Ms. Marchetti: Oh yes, there are photos. Each room is set up in historical times, one bedroom is set up with the old cradles and memorabilia. The living room has a real old piano that dates back to the 1800s, and there's a lot of really old items that people give on loan. It's really furnished very well with old, old memorabilia.    Ms. Williams: You mentioned that now you're working in the Atlantic Highlands Nursing Home. Do you find most of the people there are also residents of the community?     Ms. Marchetti: Yes. The nursing home that I'm working in is actually in Middletown Township, but it's an Atlantic Highlands mailing address. The nursing home is on Middletown Avenue. It's been there about forty years or more. I've been there now thirty-two years. If there is one thing that gives you satisfaction is to work in the nursing home. A lot of people just don't understand it, but I've always enjoyed people  I love the children and I love the elderly. Both are always so happy and content with whatever you do for them. There's always a thank you. We have Medicaid and Medicare patients, and we have some private. They do come from all over the state. We're fully staffed, thank goodness for that. I work five days a week, but I'm on call twenty-four hours a day. My only one bad time in the nursing home is on Christmas Eve day when I have to leave there. I come home and they're all there. That's the only day that bothers me. But they're happy in their own little world, they really and truly are, and they're well taken care of.    Ms. Williams: Do you find that over the years there has been the same family support, or does it change?    Ms. Marchetti: When I first went there, very rarely did we have families come in. But I think once they started to orient people and explain things to the families such as the workings of a nursing home and so on, more and more families are now interested. That makes me very, very happy. It really and truly does. There are some people who have no one, really, but I try to interest people in coming up so the men have a buddy system. We have an adopt-a-grandmother-or-grandfather program at the Atlantic Highlands Elementary School. The children come up at different times, and they'll send posters, or they'll send birthday cards. That does help the people who have no one, because their children have moved away. You'd be surprised at the number of people we have there who have no families at all.    Ms. Williams: Right. So this link with the community, with the children, is important to give a sense of connection.    Ms. Marchetti: Yes, and we have volunteers that come in, we have church services. We're going to build a new nursing home. It's going to start probably in February, and it's going to be on the same property. Once it's completed, we'll move the patients from the old building to the new building, and then tear the old one down. The worst thing, in fact, you could do with a patient is to move him or her even to move them to another room. You know we try so hard not to do this.    Ms. Williams: It's unnerving.    Ms. Marchetti: It is, and it confuses them. It really and truly confuses them. I don't care what day it is you walk in, they're just so happy to see you, and that's the satisfaction I'm talking about.    Ms. Williams: Well, you feel a sense of family there.    Ms. Marchetti: You really feel like you're somebody when you walk in there.    Ms. Williams: They see your warmth and your caring, and they look forward to that.    Ms. Marchetti: Really and truly, yes.    Ms. Williams: It sounds like you've established more of a sense of community there. You know, it's not an institution, but gives a sense of family.    Ms. Marchetti: Yes, and not only that, I always stress to all the employees when they walk through the door to have a smile on their face, because those people don't need to see somebody walking around sad. I know everybody has family problems, but employees have to leave them behind at the door. If that doesn't work out, they just don't work there anymore.    Ms. Williams: Just come and do your best, be upbeat.    Ms. Marchetti: Yes. We don't really have a big turnover of help, and that's so good, because these people need continuity. They don't need to see different people constantly taking care of them.    Ms. Williams: Right. Because there's a trust factor that builds too, there. Sometimes by the time you get to trust somebody to care for you, they're gone. And that's very unnerving.    Ms. Marchetti: Yes. We try to keep our staff a year in a certain section. And sometimes even after that, we don't move them around. They know the other patients, too. Right now we have 153 patients in the nursing home on the two floors, and the girls do move around when someone is out sick, or someone is on vacation. But they know the patients, just like we all do.    Ms. Williams: I can see your commitment to this. In everything you do, you really have a genuine caring for your work.    Ms. Marchetti: Oh, I love it. I love every minute of it. Every minute of my work.    Ms. Williams: It's not even work in the sense of work - it seems it's your life.    Ms. Marchetti: It is, it is my life, it really is. It's been a long time. But that's the way I feel as far as Atlantic Highlands is concerned. Atlantic Highlands has given me a good life.    Ms. Williams: And you've given them a good life too.    Ms. Marchetti: I've tried, and I'll keep trying. I'll continue to do whatever I can.    Ms. Williams: Before you went to the nursing home, you were at the gas company. What was your experience there?    Ms. Marchetti: I worked there when I came out of school. I went to work because the gas company was right here in town. Those days you didn't travel that far. We had the gas company, the telephone company, and the electric company right here on First Avenue. My father knew one of the supervisors down there, and he mentioned that they were looking for somebody, so I went down for the interview, and they gave me the job.    Ms. Williams: What did you do there?    Ms. Marchetti: When I first went to work there, I answered telephones, and that's the best way for anybody to learn. In this day and age, everybody wants to come in at the top. But I came in at the bottom and I worked and I answered telephones, and then I became a cashier, then a bookkeeper, and then after that they closed the office of the gas company. I went into a smaller office, and then I became manager of that office. I was manager of that office for seven or eight years. Then they closed that office, and they offered me a position in the home service department, which was out on the road dealing with the different businesses in town - all over, actually. We sold gas appliances, and promoted gas while working with the builders that were coming in at that time in mass, all over the county. That was one thing that disturbed me  they were coming in overnight and there were no ordinances or anything in place as to what they had to do. They just came in and they leveled property, and it used to make me so sick. All the beautiful farm lands that were out on the outskirts of Atlantic Highlands were gone. All those beautiful farms I can remember as a child, they just went in and leveled them.  There was no control. I mean they knew somebody, and they just walked in, and that was it. In the beginning, they didn't even have to put in roads: they would just go in, level, and start to build homes. Later on, municipalities got hold of it, and they started requiring all the curbs and streets be installed first. But, I can remember many a time going into a new development and getting stuck in the mud because the gas company had us go in and check out the dryers that the gas company would give if people would put gas in. We had to make sure and just check to make sure that the dryers were installed properly. It was one of our duties besides, you know, working with the businesses that were promoting and selling gas appliances.    Ms. Williams: So there was originally no check on development, but now there is, obviously, much more control.    Ms. Marchetti: Oh, now all is different. I'm just so glad that the planning boards and the zoning boards finally took hold. Because back in the forties, or the beginning of the fifties, when they started to build, local government should have thought back then about keeping open space. They're doing it now, but it's a little late - but at least they're trying to do what they can, you know, as far as open space.    Ms. Williams: And how did you go from there to the nursing home? Was it right from the gas company there that you began to work there?    Ms. Marchetti: No, this is what happened: the gas company dissolved the home service department. There were thirteen girls in that department, and they called the thirteen of us in to the main office and told us that they were going to dissolve the department and they would find a place for us. So I said, "Thank you, but no thank you." I was home for maybe about three months when the medical director up at the nursing home who was our family doctor, Dr. Shapiro, came to me and said, "You know, I think you should see about this position up at the nursing home," and I thought, "No, no." But he insisted, and, you know, then I did what I was told. I went up and had my interview and everything. The office was in a house on the property, and I thought, "Well, that won't be too bad to stay in the office," but then one day the doctor who was the Administrator up there at that time sent me to the nursing home. Well, my legs shook from the office over to the nursing home. But then, once I got in there and I saw the people, I just couldn't help it, my heart just poured out to them.    Ms. Williams: So you were meant to be there.    Ms. Marchetti: Yes, that was it. All that time.    Ms. Williams: And Dr. Shapiro must have known that too, to encourage you to do that.    Ms. Marchetti: To stay all those years. Really, I loved every minute of it. I just like anything I do.    Ms. Williams: You care about people, you care about service.    Ms. Marchetti: I love people, that's the whole thing in a nutshell. So many people will say to me, "Oh, this house is so big, why are you here by yourself?" I lost my husband three years ago, and I couldn't leave this house, I have too many memories. I think as you get older, you do live with your memories to a point. Not that I'm not busy, but, you know, I just live with my memories, and I can't see going into a townhouse: you don't see anyone, everybody's in rush, they're going to work. Here I walk out in my yard, and there's always somebody going by. Or you sit in that chair, and everybody blows the horn, and I just wave  I don't even know who it is, half the time.    Ms. Williams: This is where your home and your history is  you wouldn't want to give that up.    Ms. Marchetti: Oh, I wouldn't, no, no way. But as I said, my grandfather was the head caretaker up at the Rice Estate, which is Croydon Hall, and they lived where Hosford Avenue is now. There was no Hosford Avenue then. That was one big track of land, and they lived in the big farmhouse there, and he and my three uncles worked that farm for many, many years. It's amazing how things return back to you - the same thing with the day John F. Kennedy died. I think, not only myself, but everybody remembers where they were at that moment. I was working for the gas company, and I worked also in the schools because we put gas appliances in the schools in the Home Economics rooms, and I would have to go in there and demonstrate them. I was up in Keyport High School around noontime that day talking with the teacher when one of the children came running in and said, "The President's been shot!" and the two of us sat there, and she really got up in arms, and she said, "That's an awful thing to say," she said, "Is this a joke, or what?" cause you know how kids joke around with things like this. And I still to this day remember standing up there in Keyport High School that tragic day.     Ms. Williams: I think everybody in this country knew where they were when they heard that news. It was such a devastating shock.     Ms. Marchetti: Oh it was. Oh, the next three days were just unbelievable, unbelievable.    Ms. Williams: You've mentioned that Atlantic Highlands hasn't changed much except maybe First Avenue.    Ms. Marchetti: Yes, for a while there First Avenue was really going down, but all of a sudden now, it's starting to spring up. We have new businesses in town, and the County has been very, very helpful, you know, and also the State with a lot of grants that have come in to town to help the businesses in town with low interest loans, and things like that.    Ms. Williams: You have the Playhouse there.    Ms. Marchetti: We have the Playhouse here. Now we have a movie house that has five theaters in it. We have a lot of restaurants, too, and the Marina. Of all things, I can't forget our Harbor. People call it the Marina, but I still refer to it as the Harbor. I remember the Harbor being built, it really has been such an asset to the town. It's a beautiful, beautiful Harbor. That was under my jurisdiction when I was Mayor. We have a Harbor Commission, but everything comes back to Mayor and Council, as far as the workings at the Harbor. Any monies or anything that was spent had to pass Mayor and Council. Have you been to the Harbor?    Ms. Williams: Yes, I have.    Ms. Marchetti: It's gorgeous. You know it's so good because the people in town go to the Harbor, they utilize the Harbor all summer long - and even into October, November, you see people there. More and more people are back, walking down First Avenue like we used to do when we were kids.    Ms. Williams: It must be good for you to see that.    Ms. Marchetti: It's such a good feeling to see the people in town.    Ms. Williams: It's that hometown feeling.    Ms. Marchetti: A few years back, about ten years back, there was never anybody walking in town. You'd go down First Avenue at night, and it was a deserted street. But now there's a lot of life, between the restaurants that we have now, the movie theater, the dinner theater, and now we're going to have that new Inn on First Avenue. They have already broken ground for that. There's more and more people moving in. There's a lot of homes being sold in Atlantic Highlands  a lot of people who are moving into town because there is the ferry now that takes only forty minutes to go from here to New York, and without the hassle of trains and buses.    Ms. Williams: It's the best way to go, better than bus, or driving.    Ms. Marchetti: But one thing that bothered me also, is that they stopped the trains. That hurt Atlantic Highlands. Because of stopping the trains here, they stopped the boats, too. So there was nothing to draw people to Atlantic Highlands.    Ms. Williams: Why did they stop the trains? What was the reason for that?    Ms. Marchetti: Well, the trains of Central Railroad of New Jersey were just starting to break down. They closed stations in Keansburg, Belford, and Leonardo. I think money played a big factor in that. At the train station there was a Western Union office.     Ms. Williams: But it was losing money to come down this area?    Ms. Marchetti: Yes, that's the whole thing. When you were kid, when you heard that train whistle, you knew it was time to go home. Just like in town here, the gas company had a whistle that blew at seven o'clock, at twelve noon, and at five o'clock at night. That was from when they used to make gas down there. When you heard the five o'clock whistle, you knew you'd better head home.    Ms. Williams: That was your alarm!    Ms. Marchetti: That's right, that and the train!     Ms. Williams: So you had no excuse for being late coming home.    Ms. Marchetti: No, none at all.    Ms. Williams: There's certainly a lot of civic pride in you, and you can see the community is also flourishing and growing, and that must give you a lot of satisfaction.    Ms. Marchetti: Oh, it does. It really and truly does. Mayor and Council, no matter what party is in. Call and talk to me about different things. They really and truly do. It's a shame that you have to run a political line in a small little community like this, but that's the way. I always stress to all council members, once you get in there you work for the good of the town.    Ms. Williams: It's good that they tap your history and your knowledge because you can give them background that's very important to their decision-making.    Ms. Marchetti: One thing I always say to them, "Keep home rule, so you don't have to answer to anyone else. As long as you do that, you can control what you're doing in your own town." So many towns have lost that now. As I said before, when you're a sending district, whether it's the school, or what it might be, what service it is, you're going to pay. And I've seen that happen. I've seen it happen.    Ms. Williams: Do you think the identity of the town is affected then, too? Do people just feel submerged within other communities and don't feel the same independence?    Ms. Marchetti: No, I don't think that's the idea. I think it pays sometimes to give up some home rule, because the more you have to pay for local services, the more your taxes go up.  And I think that is what they are thinking about. I'd like to keep control in town.    Ms. Williams: I notice the church is right here next to your house. That's a new church, you said, not the original.    Ms. Marchetti: No, the original was on South Avenue.    Ms. Williams: So that was another change you saw, your church building moving.    Ms. Marchetti: Yes, it really hurt, I always wished they'd kept the old St. Agnes church, because that was a real small town church. It had a lot of warmth to it. But back then they just didn't seem to value things like that. First thing you knew, that was torn down, I go to St. Agnes church, I'm a member of the church, in fact I'm one of the trustees of the church. But I still feel that the old church had the warmth to it. I don't know, I don't know how to say this, but I just felt closer to God in that little old church. Most of these newer buildings are so cold, whether it be a church, a town hall. There was a lot of warmth to the old town hall and the old police station, and everything in town.    Ms. Williams: Sometimes change isn't always for the best interest of a town.    Ms. Marchetti: Sometimes changes move too fast. Instead of thinking things out, they get out there in left field and they don't know how to get back in. And that was one thing my father always taught me - think first, don't get out there in left field and then not know how to come back in. I've always lived with that advice. I'm a planner and an organizer - I have to be that way.    Ms. Williams: Well, you'd have to be that way with the positions you've had - you've been in managerial and administrative roles, both where you work and in the town - so organization is a skill that you obviously have. Tell us about your brother.    Ms. Marchetti: He stayed in town for quite a while - he worked for the gas company. Then they transferred him to Lakewood for the gas company and then in the Toms River area. It was so funny because he got involved in politics down there, and he was the Republican Mayor of Toms River, and I was the Democratic Mayor of Atlantic Highlands. Very open minded people - very broad-minded people. But we used to have more fun with that. My father, who, as I told you before, was the milkman, had a lot of funny sayings. Once we got into school and into this studying history, I came home one day and I said to my father, "Gee, Daddy, what are you - a Democrat or a Republican?" and he said, "I'm a Baptist." And I let it go at that! But he always said, "If you depend upon your livelihood in the town in which you live, you don't get mixed in politics." And I know they came after him a couple of times to run for council but he would never, ever, and he never did get involved. He was very involved in the Fire Department, the First Aid. I guess my brother and I just followed in his footsteps.    Ms. Williams: Was your mother also interested in town affairs?    Ms. Marchetti: No, God love her, she was a homebody. And that was one of the wonderful things about her, because we always had her to go home to all the time. My father had to go to bed early, because he'd have to be up at three o'clock in the morning to leave here to go down to Long Branch to pick up his milk. He had his own milk truck - he sold Sheffield Farms milk - but then he would come back here and deliver it, and he did the same thing day in and day out, seven days a week.    Ms. Williams: And that really gives you values to emulate.    Ms. Marchetti: Definitely. He was a hard working man. My father was well respected in town. I think he delivered milk to everybody in town.    Ms. Williams: You mean you'd learn about everybody's problems.    Ms. Marchetti: Yes, it was funny too, because it was like that, that no matter who had trouble they'd always talk to my father about it.    Ms. Williams: Right, and then you ended taking care of everybody when you ran for office. That's a great story, the influence that passes down. Is there anything else you'd like to add? You've said so much here that's really rich, and told so many wonderful stories.    Ms. Marchetti: I've just been running on and on and on. I think I've been jumping from one thing to another.    Ms. Williams: It gives the picture of you and of Atlantic Highlands in the whole of what you've given here. It's not so much chronological as emotional and spiritual here. We don't really have to go in order. I don't know if there's anything else that you might want to add, again knowing that this is going to be in a transcript, but could be picked up five, ten years from now by anyone going into the library. Is there a message, or a life message, or theme, or something that you want to leave with the reader or the person who listens to this tape? Can you tie it all together in some way?    Ms. Marchetti: The only one thing that I would like to say is that when you live in your town, take an interest in where you live, and do everything or anything you can do for the betterment of your town. It's not only for yourself, but it's for everyone else in the town. This teaches the children in the town, and that's what I like to do with the Historical Society and the Board of Education. We teach these children to respect their town and to respect the people who live in the town, because they're going to grow up and realize the same way we did what our town really means to us. There'll never be another town like Atlantic Highlands.    Ms. Williams: That seems to be a great ending line for our tape, I think.    Ms. Marchetti: Thank you.     Ms. Williams: Well I've certainly learned an awful lot from talking to you and I think you've really been a wonderful community servant. You work with the older adults in the nursing home and with youth through the Board of Ed and the Historical Society. You're really reaching out to so many people.    Ms. Marchetti: I appreciate your talking to me today - to listening to me.    Ms. Williams: It was a pleasure to hear all your stories and to learn about all you've done.    Ms. Marchetti: I certainly hope it helps.    Ms. Williams: I know the county will benefit from this.    Ms. Marchetti: Thank you.    Ms. Williams: Thank you, Helen.    Ms. Marchetti: And thank you to the County too, because I've worked with the county on different programs. And they've always been so good to us, they really and truly have.    Ms. Williams: Well this whole project is being supported by the Freeholders and the County.    Ms. Marchetti: That's what I'm saying, the Freeholders are so good, they really and truly are. The Monmouth County Historical Society and Commission is, too. They are always so willing to help.    Ms. Williams: This project has received a lot of support  in fact it's going to be continued next year. There are many people waiting to be interviewed.     Ms. Marchetti: Oh that's wonderful, I hope they keep it up. Because it's something that should go on year to year. It really and truly should. It shouldn't be dropped just because this year is the Millennium, it shouldn't be.    Ms. Williams: No.    Ms. Marchetti: There are other people here in town who you can really interview. Later I'll give you some names.    Ms. Williams: Flora Higgins has a list - she's requested to continue the program for next year because so many people have recommended other people.    Ms. Marchetti: Oh, she's fabulous. And towns change, people change, so it's better off that you keep up with the changes.    Ms. Williams: That's right. So I think they'll be more interviews next year, and we'll all be better for it. Thank you, again, Helen.    Ms. Marchetti: Thank you so much, really.     
MonmouthCounty;Harry Larrison, Jr.;1926;2000;Harry Larrison, Jr., 1926, 2000        Remembering The 20th Century: An Oral History of Monmouth County      Harry Larrison, Jr. (right) with former New Jersey Governor Christine Todd Whitman  Date of Interview: October 30, 2000  Name of Interviewer: June West  Premises of Interview:   Birthdate of Subject: May 28, 1926    Ms. West: FreeholderLarrison is with Larrison Coal/Fuel Oil Company Incorporated, holding the position of President.  Mr. Larrison could you tell me a little something about your family - your mom, your dad…    Mr. Larrison, Jr.: Yes, I was born in 1926. We lived on West Bangs Avenue, between Wayside and Greengrove Road in Neptune. My father's name was Harry Larrison, Sr. My mother's maiden name was Dorothy Brown  she was born in Asbury Park on Summerfield Avenue. My mother and father had four children - the sister who is two years older than I am, Dolores Hendrickson, and I had twin brothers, both whom are deceased now. They passed away in the last four years. The family lived on West Bangs Avenue for about ten years and then we moved to the corner of Wayside Road and Slocum in the Ashby Garden section of Neptune Township. We lived there about five years and then we moved to 1219 Ninth Avenue, Neptune. And we lived there until I got married in 1945.    Ms. West: So you attended schools in Neptune?    Mr. Larrison, Jr.: I attended Summerfield Grammar School. Started pre-primary, graduated the eighth grade, and I went to Neptune High School and graduated from there in 1945.    Ms. West: When you were a youngster, how do remember the town? How did it appear?    Mr. Larrison, Jr.: Well, if I remember correctly, there were about 8,000 or 9,000 people in Neptune at that time, mainly made up of the Bradley Park section, the Ridge Avenue section, the Gables, the Gardens, the Hamilton section, and Shark River Hills. And then there was a small piece of Neptune which was Shark River Highlands, along Shark River. There were different grammar schools around at that time - there was Whitesville, Ridge Avenue, Summerfield, Ocean Grove, and Bradley Park, and on Ridge Avenue in downtown Neptune. It was a small community, pretty much, the area where I lived. When I was a young boy growing up, pretty much you knew everybody who lived around you. And you pretty much knew everybody in town  it was a nice town to grow up in, and I have a lot of fond memories.        Harry Larrison Jr. and teammates on Neptune High School basketball team    Ms. West: What are some of your memories about your school days there?     Mr. Larrison, Jr.: Well, I had a great time in school. I'll never forget when I was little I used to look out the window and say, "Boy, am I ever going to get out of school?" But as look back now, they were the nicest days of my life, and I didn't have enough brains to enjoy them. But I was very happy in school. I was President of my eighth grade class at Summerfield. And I had a good time in Neptune High School, too. I played football and basketball, and did all the usual things a young boy would do.    Ms. West: When you were going to school, did you like to read?    Mr. Larrison, Jr.: Well, yes, I would read, yes, quite a bit. I still like to read, and in this position I hold now, I have a tremendous amount of reading to do.    Ms. West: Right. Did you have a favorite author as a youngster?    Mr. Larrison, Jr.: Not really.    Ms. West: You read a lot of books other than the compulsory reading that the Board of Education required, then. You did a lot of reading on your own, for your own pleasure.    Mr. Larrison, Jr.: Yes.    Ms. West: And what games did you play as a boy?    Mr. Larrison, Jr.: Well, I played just about everything. As I said before, I was on the football team and the basketball team in Neptune. But we played softball, we played kick the can, when I was little on the corner of Ninth and Ridge, and we played just about every game there was.    Ms. West: Did you have a favorite radio program that you liked to listen to?    Mr. Larrison, Jr.: Not really. There were a couple like Little Orphan Annie and those, but that was when I was real small.    Ms. West: Do you know anything about your ancestors?    Mr. Larrison, Jr.: Well, I know quite a bit. My mother's father, Ferdinand Brown, was the first plumber in the city of Asbury Park going back in the 1800s. He died when I was a little boy, and my Grandmother Brown died soon after that. On my father's side was John Larrison, who was born in Prospect Plains in Monmouth County, that's out near Hightstown. My grandmother's name was Georgiana Hyers  she was born in Howell Township. My grandfather went to the city of Asbury Park when he was a very young boy in 1905. He got a job as a helper at the railroad station. In those days they called them hacks. People would come into the Asbury Park Railroad Station and the hacks would take steamer trunks and what have you to the hotels. It was soon after that he had his own hack and then he had a livery stable with horses. He was always in business for himself  he never worked for anybody. He started the coal business in 1930, and it's still established, still going strong. I took over the operation of the business in 1958 as he got older. On my grandmother Georgiana's side, her father had a big farm on West Farms Road. That's on the corner of West Farms Road and Route 9. In those days Route 9 was called the Stage Road  it brought people from New York City to Lakewood.    Ms. West: And what town is that in?    Mr. Larrison, Jr.: Howell Township. When my grandmother and grandfather got married he settled in Neptune City, and he lived in Neptune City all of his adult life. And as I said, he was always in business for himself, he never worked for anybody.    Ms. West: Is there any particular part of the County that has any particular significance to you?    Mr. Larrison, Jr.: Well, not really. When you're in the position that I'm in, you have to love all parts. Monmouth County is a very large county, and we have just so much to offer to people. It's a beautiful county. As you drive with motorcar today, you see the rolling fields, the crops, the waterfront, and the houses - we have a little bit of everything in this county.    Ms. West: Did you have any heroes or heroines?    Mr. Larrison, Jr.: Not really. I thought a great deal about my grandfather, because he gave me the inspiration in life to never take no for an answer. If something don't work, just keep working until you make it right. That's the way he was brought up and that's the way he brought me up.    Ms. West: So he had quite a bit of influence in you life, I understand then.    Mr. Larrison, Jr.: He sure did.    Ms. West: Well, is there anything you might have wanted to say to him that you might have left unsaid?    Mr. Larrison, Jr.: He loved animals, he loved dogs, he loved to hunt, and he very rarely ever went anyplace that he didn't have at least one hound dog with him in a truck or in a car. When he would be rocking on the porch, there would be a dog sitting right by the rocking chair with him.    Ms. West: What type of music did you like to listen to?    Mr. Larrison, Jr.: Country music.    Ms. West: Country music? And what were any particular fads, the way of dressing in your day?    Mr. Larrison, Jr.: No.    Ms. West: Nothing in particular?    Mr. Larrison, Jr.: No.    Ms. West: What was the first movie you remember seeing?    Mr. Larrison, Jr.: Oh, my heavens, I can't remember that! Most of the movies that I saw were shown at the Old Palace Theater which is still there in Bradley Beach. I'll never forget we would go Sundays to my grandmother and grandfather's, and my grandfather would give my sister and me ten cents. It cost nine cents to get in the movie and one penny was for candy at Mr. Northridge Bicycle and Candy Shop right next to the movie.    Ms. West: Nine cents to get into the movie and look what it costs today. Let alone a piece of candy, right! Who's the first President that you remember?    Mr. Larrison, Jr.: The first President that I really remember is Roosevelt.    Ms. West: Anything in particular about him that makes him stand out in your mind?    Mr. Larrison, Jr.: The only thing I remember is that my grandfather didn't like him.    Ms. West: Is there any newspaper headline that stands out in your mind through the years?    Mr. Larrison, Jr.: No, not really. Of course when Morro Castle came ashore that was quite an experience in Asbury Park and the surrounding areas. My mother had two brothers, Fred Brown, and Everett Brown. One was on the police department and the other was on the fire department, and they did a lot of rescue work when the Morro Castle came ashore.    Ms. West: That was a ship I take it.    Mr. Larrison, Jr.: Yes, it was a cruise ship that caught fire at sea. A lot of lives were lost. I think it was 1934 or 1935, somewhere around there.    Ms. West: When did you become interested in politics?      Mr. Larrison at a political event  Mr. Larrison, Jr.: Well that's a funny story. I have, all of my life, enjoyed people. I like being with people, I like helping people. I joined the Ocean Grove Fire Department in 1946. I joined the First Aid Squad the same year. I'm still an active fireman, an active first aid man, but I can't do some of the work that I used to do because I just can't lift. But helping people has always been one of my great desires. We used to sit around the firehouse and this and that and the other thing would come up. In 1956, when Neptune Township Housing Authority was created, the mayor at that time asked me if I would like to go on the Township Housing Board. So I did, and I enjoyed it. I was in a position there to help people. Of course when we first organized we didn't have any dwelling units at the time, but that has grown tremendously. Neptune Township has a very, very good housing project, the places are really, really nice. I was on that for four years and then there was a vacancy on the Township Committee of Neptune because one of the committeemen, Thomas Catlee, commonly known as HattyCat, got off the Township Committee and took the job as executive director of the Housing Authority, so that created a vacancy.    Ms. West: And what year was this?    Mr. Larrison, Jr.: 1960. I was appointed there and then I ran for election in 1963 and again in 1966. I was elected each time, but I only served one month in 1966 because I was appointed to the Board of Freeholders on February 12, 1966, and I've been a Freeholder ever since.    Ms. West: What are the duties of the Freeholders?    Mr. Larrison, Jr.: Well, the duties of a Freeholder are similar to the duties of running a town. The Monmouth County Board of Freeholders runs the whole county. We run the correctional institution, the Youth Detention Center, Brookdale Community College , the Vocational School system, and the two nursing homes, John L. Montgomery and Geraldine L. Thompson. The county maintains all of the bridges in the county. We've got nine hundred and thirty seven bridges in the county. We maintain four hundred and eighty seven miles of county highways, which we pave and repave, plow the snow, and do such the maintenance and everything that goes with it. And we have numerous other things: we've got the Office on Aging, we've got the S.C.A.T. bus program that the Board of Freeholders started about twenty-seven years ago with five busses. Now we have seventy buses to bus senior citizens to doctors' offices, shopping centers, things of that nature. The Monmouth County Planning Board is also very active. Our Parks Department is recognized as one of the best in the country. When I first went on the Board of Freeholders we had about two hundred and twenty acres of parkland, and today we've got fourteen thousand acres of parkland. We've got 5,000 acres of agricultural easements - that's where the county went in and bought the development rights, and those pieces of property have to stay in farming. So the Board of Freeholders is involved in many, many, many things.    Ms. West: How many board members are there?    Mr. Larrison, Jr.: There are five members on the board.    Ms. West: You said that you were appointed, but this is an elected position.    Mr. Larrison, Jr.: Elected, yes, you run every three years for a three-year term.    Ms. West: So you've been on the board for quite a while.    Mr. Larrison, Jr.: Thirty-five years. I'm the longest tenured Freeholder in the state's history.    Ms. West: So have all of your goals come to fruition as to when you first became a member of the board?    Mr. Larrison, Jr.: Well, naturally you set certain goals. It's very rewarding to see some of the planning, and even some of the planning that was done before I became a member, because sometimes it takes years to bring things to fruition. Monmouth County has always been very fortunate to have a forward thinking Board of Freeholders  we're always looking to the future. I tell people it's very easy for me to run the county today. My obligation, as I see it, is I've got to look twenty-five or thirty-five years down the road to see what this county is going to look like and then, improve it to meet that demand many years down the road.    Ms. West: Right, you must project into the future.    Mr. Larrison, Jr.: Right.    Ms. West: How would you like to see the county in the future?    Mr. Larrison, Jr.: Well, I would like it to continue the way it's gone. Naturally the population is expanding all the time, and you have to plan for that. You can't deprive people for the right uses of their land, they're allowed to do with it what they want. A lot of people think that Monmouth County Board of Freeholders has control over zoning, and stuff like that, which we don't. That's strictly a local governing body's responsibility. They are the ones that give the permits to build the houses. I think what we have to do is continue expanding places like Brookdale College, places like the County Library, Vocational School Board, to be sure that the necessary tools are going to be there to do the job. I think that this board is dedicated to acquiring open space, so that there are plenty of places for our children twenty-five, thirty, forty years down the road to play. And all the amenities that goes with these things. We've had a little controversial thing now: we're trying to establish a ferry operation from Belford to downtown Manhattan. And we've had an opposition. Opposition is always there, no matter what you do, there's going to be people to oppose it. But I'm smart enough to see, and so are the other members of the board, that we just can't keep building highways. We can't keep building bridges and tunnels. Number one, they are extremely expensive. From a ferry terminal at Belford Creek, a trip to downtown Manhattan is about thirty minutes. And when you go across the Bay there are no streetlights, there's no snow to plow, there's no stop signs, there's just nothing, just the water. Ferry operations throughout the United States is a very hot issue now in San Francisco and all the places where they have waterways to have ferry operations. Just to give you a little example, New York Waterways is run by a fellow by the name of Imperatore. Fifteen years ago he was ferrying between twenty five hundred and three thousand people. Now he transports about twenty six thousand people a day across from Weehawken, Bayonne, Hoboken, and places like that to Monmouth County. You know you have to think back fifty years ago we had ferry service from Staten Island to the Jersey Shore up at the Highlands. They were big excursion boats, and then it all seemed to collapse with the advent of the better highways and things of that nature, but now it's coming back again.    Ms. West: When you speak of Belford and crossing the bay, what bay is that you're talking about?    Mr. Larrison, Jr.: Sandy Hook Bay and Raritan Bay.    Ms. West: I want listeners and readers to know what bay you're referring to. Okay, so then you really are looking into the future.    Mr. Larrison, Jr.: I think that's my responsibility, that's the responsibility of any office holder. I don't care whether he's a member of the school board or local government, or whatever, you have to look ahead. Because if you don't, when that ahead time comes, you're going to be behind the eight ball if you haven't planned properly.    Ms. West: With all this tremendous job that you have had for these past thirty-five years in working as a Freeholder, how do you relieve your stress? Do you have any hobbies or anything?    Mr. Larrison, Jr.: Yes, I play golf. But sometimes that could be very frustrating. And I'm an early riser, I'm usually up around five o'clock in the morning. In my business, going back when I was very young, I used to drive a tractor and trailer six days a week, three hundred and sixty seven miles a day to Pennsylvania loaded with coal and down to the Jersey Shore. Six days a week. We had five tractors and trailers on the road, and I was in charge of them even though I was a very young fella  but my grandfather had that much faith in me. It was hard work, and I just got used to getting up very early in the morning, and I've always been that way. I can go to bed at midnight and I'm wide-awake and out of bed at five.    Ms. West: We haven't mentioned your wife. How long have you been married?    Mr. Larrison, Jr.: I lost my wife in 1992 to cancer. I also had a very unfortunate thing - I lost my youngest daughter to cancer, when she was seventeen. And that was in 1975 when she passed away. My wife and I were married forty-seven years when she passed away. And I have two other daughters, Judy Larrison and my daughter Carol, who is married. Her name is Carol Pantaleo. She married a very lovely man, Matthew Pantaleo, and I have two grandsons, Travis and Zack.    Ms. West: How old are the grandchildren?    Mr. Larrison, Jr.: Travis is fifteen and Zack is thirteen.    Ms. West: Oh, young men there…    Mr. Larrison, Jr.: Yup! They grow up so fast.    Ms. West: Too fast, too fast… What would you say has been your greatest achievement?    Mr. Larrison, Jr.: Well, I don't know what the greatest achievement is, because there's just been so many of them, and to my way of thinking they were not my personal achievements. To be a business man and run a business and have a lot of customers is an achievement. There are a lot of friends and employees that you're very happy with and they're happy with you… that's an achievement that you could almost say is personal. But the achievements that I've made in government would not have been achieved without the help and input of other people.  I think the greatest thing is when people express an opinion that might give you an idea that you never thought about before. The more you talk with each other, the more you learn things that you're not thinking about. And I think that's the most interesting part.    Ms. West: If you could describe your life as a road map, how would you describe it?    Mr. Larrison, Jr.: Well, I've moved around quite a bit as far as everyday activity. I'm on the go - I'm usually over to my oil plant around six thirty, quarter to seven in the morning. And then after a couple of hours there, I'll be up in my Freehold office doing what I have to do there. And then a lot of the committee and night meetings, and a lot of communities that you have to meet with. Many people work in the daytime, and the only time they can meet is night, and you have to make yourself available if they have a problem or they've got a plan. The county and the municipality work together to create something. They're the kind of meetings that you have to go to.    Ms. West: Are your daughters involved in your business?    Mr. Larrison, Jr.: They both are, yes, they both work there.    Ms. West: If your grandchildren came to you and asked you for some advice, what advice could you give them?    Mr. Larrison, Jr.: Well, I would probably give them the same, and I talk to them quite a bit about life, even though they are young. I tell them that they have to do the right thing, number one, and to be unafraid to take a chance if you believe in what you're doing. And to always consider the other person because there is no way that you can get ahead in this world if you don't have the help of other people.    Ms. West: What is the most unusual thing about yourself?    Mr. Larrison, Jr.: Well, I don't really know. When you're in political life, you have people who you may think dislike you because you're of the opposing party. But it doesn't necessarily mean that they hate you or that they dislike you personally, it's just that they don't share your views. And in politics it's a very funny thing. There have been many, many Democrats who have moved into Monmouth County from North Jersey, from Staten Island, Brooklyn, and why did they move here? They moved here because they liked what they saw, they'd seen a house they liked, or a locality that they liked and they bought a home, or had a home built - and this is where they're going to raise their family. And after they're here a little while and see all of the things that this county and their municipality have to offer, such as excellent school systems, they just like their county, and if somebody tries to change the county now, they're going to say, "Hey, I live there, I know what it's like, and I like it, and it's nice." And sometimes they will change their party affiliation. Party affiliation today in public life is not as strong as it was many, many years ago. You can see in the paper now that there will maybe be thirty-two percent Republican, twenty-nine percent Democrat, or vice-versa, and it will be like forty or fifty percent of undeclared independents who vote for whoever they want. They don't declare themselves.    Ms. West: Do your daughters have any political aspirations?    Mr. Larrison, Jr.: I don't think so. My wife always said that one politician in a family is enough.    Ms. West: So no member of your family preceded you into politics to then?    Mr. Larrison, Jr.: No. Years and years ago my grandfather served one term on the council in Neptune City, back in the teens and early twenties. He was active in the fire company, and so was my dad. My dad was captain of the Hamilton Fire Company that's in Neptune, out in the Western part of Neptune.    Ms. West: If you could look back at your life and review it quickly, and were to leave a symbol to the populace, what symbol would you leave for us?        Mr. Larrison and his grandsons at Brookdale Community College in Larrison Hall    Mr. Larrison, Jr.: Well, I would just say the same thing I've been telling my grandchildren. Lead a good clean life and treat your neighbors and your fellow man the way you want to be treated. That's how you get along and how you get by. Because there's no one person who can accomplish everything that he or she wants to do without help. And I don't mean monetary help. I mean just the companionship, the human support for one another is what carries you along. I was very honored a year and a half ago at Brookdale Community College because I was one of the founders of that, and it's very gratifying. I've never missed a graduation. I was there during the early construction, and the first graduating class we had. We had about two hundred and ten people - last year they had twelve hundred and eighty five graduates at Brookdale. And they named a building after me -  Larrison Hall at Brookdale Community College - and I thought that was quite an honor.    Ms. West: That's quite an honor, yes, because that's there for posterity.    Mr. Larrison, Jr.: A lot of the original board members are deceased. Back in those early times we had the vision of a four-year college, but the way the community college law was structured under the state, it became a community college. If you wanted to make it a four-year college, you would lose the financial support of the state for a community college. But things have changed now, and two years ago we opened Freehold Commons, which is out on the Freehold bypass. Students can go there and get their third and fourth year of school. That program is in conjunction with Rutgers and Montclair State - with the professors and everything. That project has grown tremendously just in two years. I always advocated that it is much easier for a student who hasn't much money to live home, and it's much easier for him to get a part time job in the locality where he grew up, where he knows people. I predict in another ten or twelve years that this third and fourth year program of the community college is really going to grow.    Ms. West: What year was Brookdale built - when was the cornerstone laid?    Mr. Larrison, Jr.: We started in 1966. The first graduating class was I think 1969. I'll never forget the first meeting. It was on Geraldine Thompson's farm - it was a horse farm - and we met in one of the barns. The horses had left five or six months before that, so there were no horses around, but nobody told the flies that the horses were gone…there were thousands of flies!!! That was really something. But it was a great pleasure to see that school grow because to me education is a must. I know people who were floundering, and I can say that because my next birthday I'll be seventy five years old, and they'd come to me and I'd tell them, "The first thing that you've got to do is you've got to go get some education." And I've seen so many of them turn out so well. Once they applied themselves to learning, they just went right up the ladder. And I was always concerned about the young people that we have in the county correctional institution. And about six years ago, we started a vocational school class in the county correctional institution where some of the people, men and women, can learn a trade, and when they're done serving their sentence, whatever may be, they got something to carry with them. Because there's always somebody looking for help, somebody that's got the basics. In other words, they will not be a first class electrician when they graduate, but they'll have the basics, and they can go to work for a local electrician who will teach him all the finer points of things.    Ms. West: So that's the catalyst for a productive life when they get on the outside…    Mr. Larrison, Jr.: Absolutely. Absolutely. Repeat performances are bad, because once they get in that rut, then they may never want to help themselves.    Ms. West: Well, I guess once they get out they sometimes go back to the same environment.    Mr. Larrison, Jr.: Well, some of them do, some of them don't - but they've certainly got the opportunity now with the vocational school board.     Ms. West: Are they taking advantage of it?    Mr. Larrison, Jr.: Oh, yes. Nothing makes my heart feel better than when I see somebody come through that door who comes here to thank me for giving him a chance. That makes my day. Let me show you this little note from a little boy, I think he said he was six years old, how happy he is that we're going to enlarge the Henry Hudson Trail. Just read that, that's one of the things that make you feel good. And then, not too long ago, my picture was in the paper with another six-year-old boy. When this boy found his mother unconscious on the floor, he went to the telephone and called 911. Six years old. And the operator on the 911 line said he thought he was talking to an adult, because he instructed the little boy to stay on the line and said, "Are you home alone?", and the boy said, "No, I got two brothers, they're asleep." The operator said, "Go wake your brothers up and come right back," so he went and woke them up and came right back. One of the boys was thirteen, so he was instructed to call the police and the first aid right away. And the operator had him on the phone for about twenty minutes before help arrived, and finally the first aid man said to the 911 operator, "We've got everything under control." No matter how smart you are, there's always something new out there. Now we have a very good sheriff and a very good sheriff's department, and we are starting a little seminar in every primary first and second grade in all the schools to teach them how to use 911.    Ms. West: You can see how advantageous it is for them to know this information.    Mr. Larrison, Jr.: That's right. As I said before, there's just so many things that the Board of Freeholders are involved in, but there again, the Board of Freeholders alone can't do it. It's the people, the people who get interested.    Ms. West: You need their input.    Mr. Larrison, Jr.: That's right. You know, it's just like the PTAs - all the good things they do for the schools, and they don't get paid. Why do they do it? They do it for the love of the children, the love of the community, and love of their fellow man. To help wherever they can.    Ms. West: People care. You have to care, you have to care.    Mr. Larrison, Jr.: Well, if you don't care, there's something definitely wrong with you.    Ms. West: As you are telling your grandchildren, nobody's an island, you can't stand-alone - you have to reach out to others to guide you and show you the way. Has your life been much different than you thought it might be when you were growing up?    Mr. Larrison, Jr.: Well, I don't think so. I always use the phrase that every day is a new beginning - which it is. You never know what is going to transpire or what emergencies will pop up.  I do have people who come in here and think they have problems. When I get done talking to them, they walk out of here, and they don't have a problem.    Ms. West: They didn't know how well off they were!    Mr. Larrison, Jr.: That's right. But it's just the way that you talk to them. I remember my mother. I'll never forget when we were growing up, my mother had a saying, "Remember, if there's a tree of trouble in town, and you went and hung your troubles on the tree, ninety nine out of a hundred times you'd go back and get your own troubles off because other people have worse troubles."    Ms. West: What are your deepest values?    Mr. Larrison, Jr.: I value friendship, I value people. Because people are it - you know, it gives me a great deal of satisfaction to help somebody - that's what makes me go. It's just helping people. And sometimes, you know, it's so simple, it's just like a little boost when they need it. Sometimes employees come in here and are disgusted I'm not going anyplace on this that and the other thing, and when I explain all the good parts to everything, they feel better. That's what makes me tick.    Ms. West: This time last year everybody was talking about the new Millennium, and of course some people see the Millennium as starting January first this year as opposed to last year. How would you like to see things for your grandchildren? Not just as far as Monmouth County is concerned, but as far as the world is concerned?    Mr. Larrison, Jr.: There were all kinds of things that they told us about when the year 2000 comes in that these computers weren't going to work, and this wasn't going to work and that wasn't going to work, but I felt confident in my bones that the people understood what had to be done, and it was being done. So as a result we passed into the year 2000 and it all worked. It's kind of hard to predict what's going to be, but the computer age today sometimes scares me because there is a certain element that would use computers to hurt other people. Hopefully they would be apprehended very quickly. We hear right now that criminals do something to give computers a virus which throws it off, but hopefully technology will catch up to where that won't be a problem. But, there again, it's education, you've got to have education.    Ms. West: Thank you very much for this interview, Mr. Larrison.    Mr. Larrison, Jr.: You are welcome. 
MonmouthCounty;Harry Greenwood;1920;2000;Harry Greenwood, 1920, 2000        Remembering The 20th Century: An Oral History of Monmouth County    HarryGreenwood1.jpg (31497 bytes)  Harry Greenwood, present day  Date of Interview: June 6, 2000  Name of Interviewer: Rita Cross  Premises of Interview: Monmouth County Library Eastern Branch, Shrewsbury, NJ  Birth date of subject: August 11, 1920      Ms. Cross: When did you come to Monmouth County?    Mr. Greenwood:  I came to Red Bank in 1925, with my mother, my sister, and my dad. My father worked in the one and only diner in Red Bank at that time, which was called Callahan's Diner. It was up at the Railroad Station in Red Bank. And, of course, it was a very, very popular stop for all those coming and going on the train and local people. My mom secured a job right next door to where we lived, which incidentally was at the corner of where Boro Buses were, Globe Court and Front Street. There is a high rise garage these days, but at that time there were houses, and my mother's aunt and uncle rented us several rooms on the third floor. My first experience with Red Bank was bumping into a young man on a tricycle named Bobby Worden, whose dad ran and operated Worden's Funeral Home. Across the street was the famous Globe Hotel, a very large wooden structure. My mom secured a job there as a chambermaid, and I commenced my schooling around the corner at Mechanic Street School. And that was one of the two small grammar schools in Red Bank, the other being Oakland Street School.    Ms. Cross: What are your most prominent memories of Monmouth County?    Mr. Greenwood: I guess you could say the growth of the area. I can recall so vividly farmers coming in from the outlying districts and Colts Neck and bringing in their fruits and vegetables.  Along side of that Globe Hotel, was a hardware store Hendrickson and Applegate. And alongside of that was Bray's, which was a grocery store where these farmers would deliver their produce, located where Kislins is now.      Ms. Cross: Was this on Broad Street?    Mr. Greenwood: No this was on Front Street where Kislins is now.     Ms. Cross: There are old pictures of people in horse drawn carriages on Shrewsbury Avenue. Well, that was before your time.    Mr. Greenwood: Well, probably yes, although I do recall horses. As a matter of fact, I will tell you a cute story about Mr. Kislin: my mom told me this.  Leone Kislin started his business in a pushcart with a horse, and he carried his wares around the town of Red Bank, and he would sell them from house to house.  In time, he saved enough money and he bought a building, which is no longer there, which was adjacent to his present store. It is now a parking lot. But he was there for years. As a matter of fact, when I was a kid, Max Baer, the heavy weight champ of the world, was training in Rumson, and he'd come in for a pair of shoes, and I thought he was God almighty. He was about 6'6", and I was a little kid, but I have never forgotten that.     Ms. Cross: Do you have any other memories of famous people?    Mr. Greenwood: Yes, we have a famous fighter named Mickey Walker, and they called him The Toy Bulldog from Rumson.  He became the middle weight champion of the world, fought many times in Madison Square Garden, in Yankee Stadium, and he became an artist later on in his life, and he was really very famous, and a very nice guy. In addition to him, of course, there was Jacob Ruppert who built Yankee Stadium and the New York Yankees. Jacob Ruppert owned two world famous iceboats, and in those days, during the winter, the Shrewsbury River, which is now called the Navesink River, used to freeze. And when it used to freeze, it would freeze practically for a month or two, so they used to have famous ice boat races down there. And, one of the men who worked with my dad in Callahan's Diner was the pilot of one of the boats that Col. Ruppert owned called the Eskimo. And I had the thrill of being invited to take a ride in one of those huge iceboats down that river. And if you ever wanted to have your stomach in your mouth, that was a trip, I'll tell you. That must have gone close to 100 miles an hour in those days, just up on one keel going down the river. But, they were great days because the river would freeze, and they would have lights at night, and people would ice skate up and down the river. In fact, we had a very unfortunate thing happen that is well known in the area. A fellow named Jack Casey owned and operated the airport, off of Shrewsbury Avenue. And he had a plane.    Ms. Cross: Is that by the Airport Inn? There was an airplane on that roof.    Mr. Greenwood: That's correct, that's why they called it the Airport Inn. There was an airport there, and Jack Casey had several planes there. He even took some people to New York like a commuter taxi service. But he landed on the ice one time in Red Bank and unfortunately, he did not turn off the engine, and a man walked right into the prop and got decapitated. Oh, that was a terrible thing. I was still a little fellow, but I remember very closely.    Ms. Cross: Do you remember the Eisner Building?    Mr. Greenwood: Very well. They made uniforms there for the first and second World Wars. Mainly for the first World War though. Half of Red Bank worked in that factory. It was a sweatshop, of course, but the family was quite fair to their employees. In fact, one of the Eisners donated his home. It is now the Red Bank Library on West Front Street.  It is called the Eisner Library. He's related.     Ms. Cross: Mike Eisner is his great grandson.    Mr. Greenwood: And then the other brother donated his home, and it is now the United First Methodist Church on Broad Street.  And then we have a Supreme Court Justice, William Brennan, who just retired about five years ago. He lived in Rumson, and he belonged to a club that I belonged to called the Root Beer and Checker Club. It was a luncheon club. The business men in Red Bank would all meet down at the Root Beer and Checker Club, which was right down at the corner of Broad and East Front Street, upstairs. We had a little meeting place and we'd have lunch there. Mr. Brennan was a member of that. He was an attorney, of course, and then he became a judge, and then he was appointed to the United States Supreme Court.  He left Rumson, of course, and moved to Washington. He since retired and passed on, but he was one of our famous ones.    Ms. Cross: Did you ever live anywhere else except Monmouth County?    Mr. Greenwood: I did, indeed I did. When I was in the eighth grade, my mother had a brother who passed away out in the state of Washington. That was during the Depression. My grandmother was named the executor of his little estate, so she was going to go out to Washington, but she asked my mom if she would accompany her, so naturally, my mom took my sister and me out of school.  We took a Greyhound Bus and started out  ended up in Chicago. We stayed two days there to see the Great World's Fair, which I will never forget. And then from there we went to the state of Washington, which was a gorgeous country.    Ms. Cross: But you missed Monmouth County?    Mr. Greenwood: Well, I only stayed out there a little over a year, but I met a lot of great people in Washington. Spent a school year there, and it was a blessing to me, because I was a little shy, but the teacher insisted that I get up and tell everyone about the East and Red Bank.  So, I learned to speak before people. And then, of course, when I came back, the same thing applied, and the teachers asked me to get up, and the next thing you know, I'm elected president of my class in high school, and so I remained to be president in the eleventh and twelfth grade.    Ms. Cross: What high school?    Mr. Greenwood: Red Bank High School. I was also president of the Student Council. I was captain of the basketball team, so I was very, very active in school. From there I started in the bank, which was called the Merchant's Trust Company, at 28 Broad Street, in Red Bank.    Ms. Cross: Oh, my God.    Mr. Greenwood: Which is where Murphy's Restaurant is now on Broad Street in Red Bank.  I went to night school at Monmouth Junior College until the War broke out and then I went in the Army Air Force and ended up over seas with the 9th Air Force as the crew chief on a P-47 Fighter bomber. Went all the way through Europe, through D-Day. And that was in 1944.  I will never forget it. My plane flew seven missions that day over that English Channel.    Ms. Cross: I am surprised that Tom Brokaw didn't get in touch with you.     Mr. Greenwood: Yes, that book is a marvelous book about our generation.    Ms. Cross: Yes, they are going to try and get a monument....    Mr. Greenwood: Which is duly needed.    Ms. Cross: Tell us how you were treated in Monmouth County when you got home.    Mr. Greenwood: Well, ironically, I had an opportunity to finish college, but Mr. Kenneth McQueen, who was president of the bank, called me and insisted that I please come back to the bank where they promised a promotion because I was one of the very first ones out of the service. I was one of the first because once Germany capitulated, we were on our way to Asia, to fight the Japs, and low and behold the A-Bomb was dropped, and the War ended, and they did not know what to do with all of us. So when they shipped us back to the States, I ended up at what was called McGuire Base now, but then it was Fort Dix. It was close to a million GIs there, and they didn't know what to do with us. But they finally did it by points. I was overseas so long that I had a lot of points, so I got out in September, 1945 and got back to Red Bank. And you know I had the joyous reunion with my family. My mom, and sister, and all my friends. But the boss at the bank called me and asked me, "What are you going to do?" And I said, "I haven't any plans yet, but I'd like to go back to college." And he said, "Well, why don't you come back to the Bank, and then you can go to school at night, and we'll pay your tuition. We direly need you, because all the other fellows are still in the service." So I went back to the bank.    Ms. Cross: You were in the right place at the right time.    Mr. Greenwood: That's right.    Ms. Cross: You ended up as a Regional Vice President, right?    Mr. Greenwood: Regional Vice President, yes I did.    Ms. Cross: How long did you work for the bank?    Mr. Greenwood: Forty years. I retired in 1983, and I still stayed on as a consultant for awhile, but then PNC, which is the name of the bank now, came along now and merged with Midlantic, and so I stepped down, but I have been very active all these years since I retired. I have done a lot in the county. I do income taxes through VITA, which is Volunteer Income Tax Assistance. In fact, we used to meet right here to get updated, and then I worked at the Red Bank Library filling in, and I had a little practice of my own. In fact, I have been laid up physically for several things, bleeding ulcers and this and that, so the doctors have decided that I should slow down. But, I still love to help people. I have powers of attorney for several people at the nursing home here in Red Bank. And I am very, very active in the Red Bank Lion's Club and the Red Bank Welfare Association.    Ms. Cross: Do you have a church you belong to?    Mr. Greenwood: The Red Bank Methodist Church. I am not as active as I used to be.    Ms. Cross: You play golf.    Mr. Greenwood: I love golf. I played yesterday, which was Sunday, and hope to play Thursday. I play at Old Orchard. But, I have seen a lot of growth, a lot of changes.    Ms. Cross: Tell us, tell us about some of the changes.    Mr. Greenwood: Well, even as far back as when I started with the bank. There used to be only two banks in town. The bank that I started it was called the Merchant's Trust Company, and the other was called the Second National Bank, and that's the famous marble building on Broad Street.    Ms. Cross: Did you see that go up?    Mr. Greenwood: Well no. It came to Red Bank just about ten yers before I was born.    Ms. Cross: That was a formidable building.    Mr. Greenwood: At that time, it was a bank. When I came back from the state of Washington, the stock market had crashed and there was a depression. The other tall building down on Broad Street was called the Broad Street National Banks. That was one of the banks that went under in the Depression. The Bank Holiday they called it.    Ms. Cross: What do you remember about the Depression? What impact did it have on the people on the street?    Mr. Greenwood: Oh my yes, even around this area. And you see, there was no such thing as food stamps or helping people. There was no such agency.    Ms. Cross: There was something called Relief.    Mr. Greenwood: Well there was Relief, yes, but they were more or less soup kitchens and you'd stand in line to get what they called soup or something like that. They were hard times. They were very hard times, I tell you, when we were out in the state of Washington. My uncle had worked at the Northern Pacific Railroad, and he died, but he had a little, little bungalow that we stayed in. And the trouble was, what little money he had was tied up in a bank. And my grandmother was the executor, but it took forever and a day to try to settle the little things, sell the little house, and so on. It took a whole year. That's why I spent a year out there in school.    Ms. Cross: And so when you came back, was the Depression still on?    Mr. Greenwood: Yes, indeed, it was.    Ms. Cross: Were there a lot of boarded up stores?    Mr. Greenwood: No, there were not. I won't say that, no. No. There were stores there, although the banks were closed, and some of the stores were closed, but they weren't boarded up or anything like that. But gradually, thank God for FDR. As we all know, he was elected and he started the Bank Holiday. Then the Depression was getting near the end, so he instituted many things, such as WPA, the Work Progress Administration, the Civilian Conservation Corps, and Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.     Ms. Cross: Now, tell me what you know about down at the ocean.    Mr. Greenwood: Long Branch and Asbury Park.    Ms. Cross: Yes, and Sea Bright, and Monmouth Beach. They were fishing villages.    Mr. Greenwood: Yes, they were.    Ms. Cross: And Sandy Hook. Did you have any dealings with that?    Mr. Greenwood: Well, the only thing I can recall with Sandy Hook was Fort Hancock. Fort Hancock used to send their high school children on a bus to Red Bank High School where I was going to school. As a matter of fact so did Fair Haven, so did Colts Neck and Holmdel. They'd bus children there because there were no high schools in those areas, you see. They only had the one high school. So, we had quite large classes. In fact, we had double sessions. Double sessions of school because they had so many children coming in.    Ms. Cross: Because Red Bank was sort of a hub.    Mr. Greenwood: That is right. Even Red Bank Catholic had only St. James Grammar School, so even all those children in those early years came to Red Bank High School until Red Bank Catholic was built and started. And that was back in the early 1930s, I would say, when Red Bank Catholic School became into fruition.    Ms. Cross: And how about the hospital?    Mr. Greenwood: I was a patient in Riverview with appendicitis when I was a boy. That was a wooden home down at the same location where it is on the river, and oh gosh, I can remember Dr. Walter Rullman.  He came from a prominent family around this area. He married a woman named Fields and she was well known in the area too, but that was the one and only little hospital other than one in Long Branch called the Hazard Hospital.    Ms. Cross: I don't remember what Riverview was called.    Mr. Greenwood: It was called Riverview.    Ms. Cross: It was always called Riverview?    Mr. Greenwood: Yes, it was to my knowledge. There was a woman called Throckmorton.  She was the head nurse and administrator, and she was there for forty or fifty years.  But I saw the growth of that hospital and now the Blaisdell Wing.  Bud, who owned Blaisdell Lumber Company, just passed away about five or six years ago. But he was the chairman of the Board of Trustees, and he raised a lot of money to put the addition on. And, of course, the property that they expanded was called Irwins.  Irwins Yacht Works is down below. But, Captain Irwin's home was right on the top of that gorgeous hill on a beautiful white home, and Old Cap Irwin used to have a white sailor cap that he used to wear and sit out there. Washington Street was a beautiful area at that time. I did a lot of fishing and crabbing there, and we'd go down there for shiners, so we could use them for bait to catch blue fish. We used to have what we called the Steamboat Dock.  There used to be steamboats.     Ms. Cross: How far up did they come?    Mr. Greenwood: They come to the Steamboat Dock, which is now Marine Park, and then they would go all the way to New York and back, sure. In fact, years ago, they used to catch a lot of oysters. The Irwins used to love to tell this story. They used to get oysters in this river and they'd take them almost daily up to New York on the boats and sell them to the fish markets.    Ms. Cross: Did Atlantic Highlands do a lot of that?    Mr. Greenwood: That's right, Atlantic Highlands, of course, which was even closer to New York than Red Bank was.    Ms. Cross: But they came all the way up to Red Bank.      Mr. Greenwood: Absolutely.  Let's see, one was called the Blue Bird, oh, and the Albertina. That was the other one.     Ms. Cross: The bridge was there though in the middle.    Mr. Greenwood: They didn't come that far. See they just came right to this Marine Park over there.    Ms. Cross: What were the different trends and fads in your life?    Mr. Greenwood: You know, we were so innocent in my day.     Ms. Cross: Tell me about the radio.    Mr. Greenwood: When I was in Philadelphia before I came to Monmouth County, I still remember, even though I was three or four years old, my dad had what they call a crystal set. That was a thrill. And then when we came to Red Bank, I remember we had a Sears and Roebuck on Monmouth Street and a J.C. Penney. That was a big store where Monmouth Street connects with Broad.  That was very popular. And Sears came in and expanded onto White Street. They were there for many years. I saved money from my paper route for a radio. I used to deliver the Red Bank Register, which came out every Thursday, and that was the popular paper.  Long Branch had a paper called the Long Branch Daily Record, which is no longer.  They were the only papers that I recall. But, I saved my money, and my mom allowed me to buy a little Silvertone radio from Sears and Roebuck, and I think it cost me something like four or five dollars. That was a lot of money in those days, sure. That was a thrill.    Ms. Cross: And movies?    Mr. Greenwood: And movies? We had the Carlton Theatre, which is now the Count Basie Theatre on Monmouth Street. And we had the Strand Theatre, which is The Merrill Lynch building, right on the corner of Linden Place.  Incidentally, talking about the Count Basie Theatre, I told you I went to school at Mechanic Street School. Well, further down by the Mechanic Street School is where Bill Basie was born and raised. Of course, that was a generation ahead of me, but I recall Count Basie's dad  he was a janitor. He used to clean the buildings of Quinn & Doremus, McQue, and Russell.  And Count Basie's father was such a great old gentleman  he had a little account at the bank. I never saw Count Basie to my recollection until he became famous and he'd come back to Red Bank and he'd bring the band back and play occasionally.    Ms. Cross: What were the demographics mostly on the west side?    Mr. Greenwood: The west side was pretty  it wasn't quite minorities like the blacks at that time. There were some, but it was a lot of Italians, and a white element. As a matter of fact, my mom, before she got married, and her sister and my grandmother had an apartment up on Shrewsbury Avenue. They were working at Eisner's at that time. The west side has changed somewhat, but it was pretty predominantly Italian at that time over there. It gradually became more, what in my day we used to call "colored people," you know. But now they are African Americans. And I had a lot of friends who were colored people. I played basketball on the high school team with two or three Blacks. In fact, one of them is Dr. James Parker.    Ms. Cross: I know him.     Ms. Greenwood: Do you know James Jimmy Parker?    Ms. Cross: He goes to the Unitarian Meetinghouse.    Mr. Greenwood: A great gentleman. Yes. I was a sophomore when he was a senior, so I had the thrill of playing with him. I consider him a friend to this day. The father of the owner of the Child's Funeral Home and I went to Mechanic School together. So there were a lot of nice Black people.    Ms. Cross: Was there a socialization between you?    Mr. Greenwood: Sure there was some. Not too much, but I can remember Johnny Child's dad. We had a little basket up on the garage that I used to shoot baskets. He'd come over after school and once in a while Mom would say, "Can you stay for a bite to eat," you know, and he'd come on in the house. So, I never thought anything different. You know?    Ms. Cross: That's very nice.    Mr. Greenwood: No segregation to speak of. And as I said, there were only the two banks at the time.    Ms. Cross: Do you remember the first movie you saw?    Mr. Greenwood: I wish I could. Something rings the bell that it was something like Tom Mix, the cowboy.    Ms. Cross: Oh, the afternoon serials. Did you go to those?    Mr. Greenwood: Oh, yes, I did. And what was that Pearl White. There was a Pearl White, I think, that gosh, there was always a bad guy that would get her and they'd tie her to the railroad tracks and somebody would come and rescue her. But, you'd have that continuation from one week to the next.    Ms. Cross: Was Red Bank a safer place in those days?    Mr. Greenwood:  I don't know of any girl that ever got raped or had to leave school because she was pregnant or anything like that in my day, you know. And, believe me when I tell you that all the way to my graduation, I never drank. I was a sports nut, you know. But most of my buddies didn't drink, either. And I never smoked until I came out of the Army, believe it or not. And then I started to have a few beers and stuff. It was a different lifestyle, you know. It really was. We had dances at the YMCA, sure we did. The YMCA has quite a history in Red Bank.    Ms. Cross: Tell us.    Mr. Greenwood: Well, my first recollection of the Y is a little house that they rented on the corner of Hudson Avenue and Branch Avenue. It is now a doctor's office. And that was where you'd go to the Y. We called it the High Y Club, and we had an advisor, and they had a ping pong table in there, which is probably the dining room of what the house was originally. And you had meeting rooms upstairs, and we had maybe twenty, twenty-five members, and maybe once a month we'd be taken down to Asbury Park where the YMCA had a swimming pool. And there was a natatorium, which had another swimming pool on the boardwalk in Asbury Park.    Ms. Cross: You'd go to the Boardwalk in Asbury?    Mr. Greenwood: Oh my, I'll say.  And back then, there was something that I recall so vividly: the sinking of The Morro Castle, the famous luxury liner that burned and ended up right on the beach at Convention Hall. You could throw a stone to it.    Ms. Cross: How old were you?    Mr. Greenwood: Well, let's see. The Morro Castle sank in 1934, so I was fourteen years old. And one other thing that was so prominent about that event. I had an uncle who had a touring car. Nobody had cars in those days, you know, but he did. He grabbed my mom, my sister, and me and drove us down to Asbury. And while he parked and we're walking towards the Convention Hall to see this huge ship out there, I see this giant walking down the Boardwalk. And, all of a sudden, I recognized who it was: it was Prima Canero!  The heavyweight champ of the world from Italy, and he was training.  There was a famous promoter named Mike Jacobs. He was like this guy King is today and he controlled all boxing. He lived in this huge home in Rumson and had a place down there where he'd bring these boxers, and they'd work out and train for their fights. And that's where Canaro was, and he wanted to go and see the ship wreck, too. Then, I also saw the Hindenburg the day it crashed. It flew right over my house in 1937.  Prior to that, the Graf Zeppelin used to come over us many, many times. I tell you, I tell my children and my grandchildren, you had to see it to believe it. It was so huge. So big. Yes, we saw that Hindenburg, that very day and, of course, the weather was so bad, it kept flying around, because it couldn't land, you see. They were afraid just what did happen would happen. And, of course, the story goes. You see static electricity. With all the hydrogen in the thing, it blew up. And it was sad.     Ms. Cross: Did you ever go to the Paramount? What were some things that you went to?    Mr. Greenwood: Yes, oh gosh, and the theatres in Asbury Park, The Mayfair Theatre. Oh my gracious that was a thrill. Just to go to Boardwalk in Asbury, there were so many things going on there, it was exciting.    Ms. Cross: What did you do when you graduated from high school? After the prom.    Mr. Greenwood: The night that I graduated, we had a dance, and we ended up in Asbury Park in The Rainbow Room. That's exactly where we ended up that night. That was the place. Sure it was. Oh, Asbury was so beautiful.    Ms. Cross: It's very sad.    Mr. Greenwood: Yes, it is sad.     Ms. Cross: Please tell us about your family. Did you meet a local girl?    Mr. Greenwood: I met a local girl in Long Branch after I got out of the service. We married in 1950, and we had three children. And, I had the unfortunate experience of losing my wife when she was only forty-seven years of age to cancer. It's a long story, and I don't want to go into it. Our youngest was only thirteen at the time.    Ms. Cross: And you took over.    Mr. Greenwood: I took over. My wife was a great gal, an Italian gal, from a great family. In fact, to this day, my brother-in-law and I are not only brother-in-laws, but we are good friends.    Ms. Cross: Did you ever remarry?    Mr. Greenwood: I remarried, but it didn't take. She was a lovely woman and we are still very compatible, but I had to mesh two families together, you know.  It didn't work.    Ms. Cross: My son is going through that. Blended families are tough. They call them blended families today. They have a name.    Mr. Greenwood: That's right. Different words. They have names for everything today. Our first child was a boy, Bruce, and he lives in Little Silver. He is married to a lovely girl who works for Lucent. And they have two children. The young lady is now thirteen. She just became a teenager. And the boy is about twelve. They are Ashley and Andrew. They go to Little Silver School, of course. And then my daughter Donna followed me in my footsteps, she is a banker. She is an assistant vice president and manager of a new bank called Two Rivers Community Bank in Middletown. She has been with three or four banks and moved along. And she is married to a great guy from Long Branch who works for Civil Service over at Fort Monmouth. And, she's got a son who just got out of college. She's got a daughter who just graduated the other night from Shore Regional.    Ms. Cross: So your family has stayed around you.    Mr. Greenwood: Oh yes.  Their youngest daughter, she is eleven going on twenty. One of those, she knows everything, you know, and a character. But my youngest boy, who was only thirteen when Betty died, is a minister up in Providence, Rhode Island. And he is married to a lovely wife and they have two children. And, I am leaving Friday to go up there because they are having a big celebration for him in church. It is his fourteenth year as a minister. He is a minister at the Church of Boston. It is a Protestant denomination. Yes, he's quite a young man. He went to the University of Massachusetts and became a mechanical engineer working for the government. And low and behold, he got the call and called me up one day and said, "You sitting down, Dad?" And I said, "Yes, why?" He said, "I am leaving my job. I'm going to go back to college and becoming a minister."    Ms. Cross: Wonderful. Its nice that you have your family.    Mr. Greenwood: Yes.... I have five of my grandchildren around me.    Ms. Cross: How have the schools changed between the time you came and went, your children, even your grandchildren? You could expand on that a little bit.    Mr. Greenwood: Well, that's right. As a matter of fact, what is now known as the middle school in Red Bank, which is on Harding Road, was the high school in my day. That is where I graduated from. And then, of course, everything changed with the growth after the War. The Parkway got built, and people found that Monmouth County was a beautiful place to live, so the population just exploded and, of course, they built the regional high school to include Little Silver, and it's a beautiful place. In fact, I am going there tomorrow morning. I'm very active as I told you in the Lion's Club, and we give out scholarships. One of the recipients is a young man I am going to interview tomorrow morning.    Ms. Cross: That sounds nice. There must have been a lot of vacant land that's no longer vacant.    Mr. Greenwood: Oh, my goodness yes. And in Little Silver particularly. The famous Lovett family had nurseries all over creation in this county. And little by little, I have seen it sold off and sold off and houses and businesses built.    Ms. Cross: Have you seen the new Sickles?    Mr. Greenwood: Yes, I have.    Ms. Cross: That's amazing, yes. What interests me is how much money there is around. Was this area always affluent like this?    Mr. Greenwood: Oh, well, yes, the Rumson area. It was always Rumson, you know. That was the money place because Red Bank was always a big commuting center, see. You know, to New York City. Even when it was just steam engines. I remember that. We used to have one called Blue Comet, and gosh, we'd go up to the railroad just to watch it come in, you know, when we were kids. I lived maybe three or four blocks from there. There was the family called the Russell Family that owned Boro Buses, and that was very, very prominent. There must of have been forty or fifty buses that toured the whole county. Don't forget, there weren't a lot of people who owned cars in those days, you know. In fact, we never even had a telephone in my house even when I was working in the bank, for heaven's sakes.    Ms. Cross: When did you get your first phone?    Mr. Greenwood: I would say, believe it or not, it was close to 1950.    Ms. Cross: And people sat on their porches a lot?    Mr. Greenwood: Oh yes, especially in the evenings in the summertime, and naturally you didn't have any air conditioning. But it was neat, because the kids would all be playing. There again, you didn't worry about a lot of traffic because there weren't too many cars around. When we were young we used to have mail delivered twice a day, and we used to have the iceman come everyday. They were two colored fellows from Westside, the Green brothers, and they had an ice company, see. They'd bring the ice. We didn't have refrigerators, but you had an icebox, so you put the ice in there. The fruit and vegetable man would come around with the bananas, too.    Ms. Cross: People came then, peddlers came to the home.    Mr. Greenwood: Exactly. The peddlers came, exactly. It was kind of fun to look forward to them everyday.    Ms. Cross: It was colorful.    Mr. Greenwood: We used to have only a coal stove upstairs and then, I forgot what year it was, my mom rented a house that had a little furnace downstairs, and the coal man would come and he put the coal down the chute to the cellar. You had a little section where the coal would go in. And you used to have to go down and bank it every night and get up in the morning and get it started again.  You'd sift the coal, you know, to make sure you got it all.  It was the only way to heat the home. And of course, you had a big stove in the kitchen that mom used to keep shined with shoe polish, for heaven's sakes. But you did all the cooking on it. Those were fun days. I think families were much, much closer than they are today in that regard.    Ms. Cross: What about some of the medical practices when you were growing up? Did the doctor come to the house?     Mr. Greenwood: Yes, they would come to the house. I vaguely remember even in Philadelphia, my sister always got the diseases much more severely than I did.  I'd just get a light case of whatever she had. We got diphtheria in those days. They'd quarantine the house and you couldn't go out and people couldn't come in except the doctor, and they almost lost my sister. I can remember to this day they talked about that.    Ms. Cross: Tell us about the quarantine.    Mr. Greenwood: They would put a sign on the door. No one was allowed inside that house because there was diphtheria there. It was very contagious. We lived in a row of tenement houses with one attached to the other in Philadelphia. I wasn't even allowed to go out. We had a little tiny back yard. In fact, we had an outhouse back there. We didn't have indoor plumbing in Philly at that time. So, I can remember the doctor coming and he'd go upstairs and go into sister's bedroom and doctor her. Finally, she pulled out of it.    Ms. Cross: Did they do that here? Did they quarantine here?    Mr. Greenwood: Yes, they did. They quarantined in this area, too. As they say, you only had the one little hospital in Red Bank, but then, you had doctors that were just so patient. You could go in there and you could talk with them. Today, it's a factory as you probably know.     Ms. Cross: What did you pay them, and how did you pay them?    Mr. Greenwood: Oh, my gracious. Well, let me think. You had to pay by cash, of course, but if you didn't have it, why you'd give what you could. But I forget really how much it was, but it was very, very nominal. I can recall even when I came out of the service, I was pretty well shattered. I was very nervous. I just couldn't settle down. I guess after being overseas all that time. And, I wanted to go to Dr. Rullman. So, I went and, of course, his wife was just a tremendous woman. All of us, all of us young men had been together. We had a sailing club down at the river, okay. She lived on the river, so she knew all of us. And we went in the service, we wrote letters back to her, and she, in turn, would write to us. And, I can recall we had a reunion. We called ourselves the Bare Foot Yacht Club. Okay, we had about thirty guys and a couple of girls too, good sailors. When we'd come home, we'd have a reunion. And that woman, Mrs. Rullman, had a book, and I wish I could tell you how big it was. She had every single letter that every single guy wrote to her through the war. She had them encased.  There was a lot of closeness, you know, which has somehow disappeared. Even in the YMCA, which graduated from that little YMCA I told you about. They built a YMCA and put a gym downstairs. They had a couple of rooms, weight rooms, and you could do a little gymnastics. I grew up with a Y and as a matter of fact, when I came back from the service, I started helping at the Y. I went to work there. Didn't get paid, but I ran gym classes, basketball classes, Saturday mornings for grade school kids.    Ms. Cross: Well, you were somewhat of a hero too, when you came home.    Mr. Greenwood: Well, too modestly, too modestly.  I was in the Air Force.  I was a crew chief. I took care of the fighter bomber. I had about six people under me that were what they call armourers. They'd put the ammunition in the guns, and then I had a photographer who watched the camera that was going to go on. We went all the way into Germany, you know. It got to the point where, like I say, I just saw too much of the war and I came back nervous. I went to see Dr. Rullman and he said, "Harry, God, it's so great to see you, but you know, I'm the head honcho now at both Riverview Hospital and Monmouth Medical Hospital. So I am not taking any patients, but right across the street there is a young Jewish doctor. He just had his first patient yesterday. He just got out of the Army and he married a local girl, why don't you go over to him?"  And that's what I did.    Ms. Cross: What's his name?    Mr. Greenwood: His name was Elias Long. Dr. Long. When I got married and my children came along, if they got sick, my wife would pick up the phone. He'd get out of his bed, and he'd come right over to your house. That was the type of doctor he was. There were other doctors that did the same thing around here.     Ms. Cross: That's a change.    Mr. Greenwood: That's a big change now.     Ms. Cross:  If you could describe your life as a road map, with a rocky road, virgin path, downhill slide, how would you describe it?    Mr. Greenwood: Well, a rocky start because my mom and dad divorced, which was very, very unusual.    Ms. Cross: Very unusual. How was she treated in this town? Was she accepted?    Mr. Greenwood: Yes, she was accepted, yes, but it was tough on her, because you know, unfortunately, my dad was an alcoholic. And when he was sober, he was a great guy. But he wasn't always sober. So, she went to a lawyer and got a divorce. She worked in a steam laundry up on White Street. There was Leon's Laundry and there was another called Smock, Harvey Smock, and my mom worked in both those laundries.  I can remember after school going up there. And I'm telling you on those summer days, it was hot. Here they are, putting sheets through the mangle, and oh God, it was hot. My mom was a tremendous woman. She lived to be ninety-seven, and she lived in Red Bank, in her own little home on Waverly Place. She died in her own bed at age ninety-seven. My sister, who became a widow, broke up her home in Freehold and came down to live with my mom the last three or four years. So, between myself and my sister, we did what we could for Mom and we had nurses come in and help.    Ms. Cross: Well, that's a change.    Mr. Greenwood: Yes, indeed.    Ms. Cross: No nursing home.    Mr. Greenwood: No, no, no nursing home.    Ms. Cross: And she was able to get around?     Mr. Greenwood: Well, right up until the last two years she was. Even until I'd say the last year, we used to get her up, and she could walk upstairs in her little house, but she couldn't navigate the steps on her own.    Ms. Cross: And she had all her faculties?    Mr. Greenwood: You bet. But what a tough life she had. I guess that's what made people strong. It really did. My closest friends all were able right after high school to go to college, and I couldn't. But that didn't leave me without friends. Everyone of them respected me because, as they said, I managed to be the president of my class, president of the student council, but we just had no money for college, so after I started in the bank, I started going to Monmouth Junior College at night. And, then I went to what they called AIB, American Institute of Banking. I graduated from there and actually became an instructor years later.     Ms. Cross: You did alright....    Mr. Greenwood: Yeah, I did okay.    Ms. Cross: That's interesting, though, that at that point in time somebody would divorce. Because it was almost unheard of.    Mr. Greenwood: It was almost unheard of.    Ms. Cross: And people treated her alright.    Mr. Greenwood: That's right. She had quite a few friends that she associated with, and she loved to play cards, so there were neighbors that she played cards with. Even went to the movies with them. There were a couple of things like some of the Senior Citizen groups that they have today, you know. She would go on a couple of trips with them on the bus, so she had a little social life. Naturally, when my sister got married and had children, my mom was the focal point of our family even then. The kids loved her, and she loved them. When I got married and had children, well they all called her nana.    Ms. Cross: She must have helped you out with your children.    Mr. Greenwood: Yes, she did. Yes, she did, yes she did. There was never much money around in our family, there really wasn't, but you never missed it because you never had it, you know, and what you did have you'd appreciate, really.    Ms. Cross: What do you think when you walk down the street, like yesterday after the River Fest. When you walk down the street in Red Bank, what do you feel?    Mr. Greenwood: I have mixed emotions, I do. I think it's wonderful for Red Bank because it's a booming town. You know, I saw it grow. I became very involved in it, because of the banking part of it.  I was on the Chamber of Commerce, of course, and I saw Red Bank grow, but then I saw it start to go down hill, too, when Monmouth Mall got built over there, and some of the stores were closing, and it got pretty tough. Then the Grove got built, and that hurt the business area in Red Bank, too. And it got to the point where you did get concerned. But then, it has made a tremendous turn around.    Ms. Cross: What do you think did it?    Mr. Greenwood: I will give the Mayor and the Council all the credit in the world. There again, his dad and I are the same age, and his dad and I went to grammar school together, but then, he was a Catholic and went on to Red Bank Catholic High School. So, we separated that way. He was my dentist until the time he retired, his father, and I think his son has done a great job as mayor, I really do. He has the foresight to bring in outside personnel, and they became what they call the River Center. That is a separate entity, which hired them to come in and just take an inventory of the town and see what they thought could be done to bring it back to where it was at one prior time. So, River Center is alive and active, and I give them all the credit in the world, too. I think also they brought a lot of business into Red Bank, gave them a lot of incentives, and tax abatements to start with. They fixed the front of the buildings up, and things like that.    Ms. Cross: Katherine Elkus White was a good mayor, too.    Mr. Greenwood: Oh, she was a good mayor at one time.    Ms. Cross: I think she was the one who kept Red Bank from going like Asbury Park and Long Branch.    Mr. Greenwood: Yes, indeed, that's right. You're right, and we were blessed with several good mayors. We had some great mayors. In fact, one of them just retired last week as the Superior Court Judge, that's Dan O'Hern. Dan O'Hern became seventy, and he had to retire. Well, he was our mayor at Red Bank. And Judge George Gray, he was another one who became mayor after Katherine Elkus White. So, we have been blessed, yes, we have.    Ms. Cross:  In what way is your life now different from what you thought it would be when you were young?    Mr. Greenwood: Oh my, well. I guess I'd have to put it that I have been blessed. I thought when I was young that I'd advance just so far in the bank and that would be it, and as it turned around, I became pretty successful in that way. Consequently, I became quite well known in the area, and I think even to this day, you know, I'm still flattered when I go somewhere, people say, Oh, you're Mr. Greenwood, or you gave me your first mortgage, or, gosh I remember my dad brought me in, and you gave me a car loan. You know, those kind of things. So, I can't complain. I've done well.    Ms. Cross: Do you see a difference in banking?    Mr. Greenwood: Oh yes, yes. Banking has changed drastically. Naturally have more banks than there ever was  there is a bank on every corner.    Ms. Cross: There is no friendly banker anymore.    Mr. Greenwood: That is true, and you know, I don't talk about it too much, but it's true. People come up to me and say, "I can always remember coming in and even if you were busy, you'd raise your hand and say hello." Nobody talks to customers anymore. They're all just a number, and they want you to use ATMs and drive ins. But there are some little community banks that are still trying. I'll give them credit. You take the Shrewsbury State Bank, that has done very well staying independent. Now my daughter is with a new bank.    Ms. Cross:  I know some of the Board members.    Mr. Greenwood: Oh do you?    Ms. Cross: I almost bought stock, but that's too much money. They wanted a big block of money.    Mr. Greenwood: I bought some only because of my daughter, because she's a manager. Now they are going to come back to Tinton Falls, did you know that?    Ms. Cross: No.    Mr. Greenwood: Well the bank bought Tinton Falls Bank out. Its called Commerce. We'll see. They're building.    Ms. Cross:  I lived around there. Well, thank you very much for this enjoyable and instructive interview.    Mr. Greenwood: My pleasure.   
MonmouthCounty;Harold D. Lindemann;1908;2000;Harold D. Lindemann, 1908, 2000        Remembering the 20th Century: An Oral History of Monmouth County      Harold Lindemann  Date of Interview: January 28, 2000  Name of Interviewer: Flora Higgins  Premises of Interview: Mr. Lindemann's home, Eatontown, NJ  Birthdate of subject: August 30, 1908  Deceased: December 13, 2000    Mr. Lindemann: It's great to be alive.    Ms. Higgins: Yes, it is.    Mr. Lindemann: That is my favorite slogan.    Ms. Higgins: And on such a beautiful snowy day.    Mr. Lindemann: I was born and raised in Wisconsin. There is a lot of snow there, and I love snow. (Laughs...)    Ms. Higgins: Again, good afternoon Mr. Lindemann. How are you?    Mr. Lindemann: Fine. You?    Ms. Higgins: I'm fine.    Mr. Lindemann: That's good.    Ms. Higgins: How did you come to live here in Monmouth County, and when?    Mr. Lindemann: Well, I was living in North Jersey, and I was single when I first came down here, which was in 1934, and I rented a room and board in a home in Long Branch for $10.00 a week. (Laughs) I'd like to get that today!    Ms. Higgins: (Laughs) Yes, really, you can't get breakfast for that now.    Mr. Lindemann: I was working for Swift and Company, meat packing in Long Branch, and I worked for that company for thirteen years. Then, I got married. My wife and I wanted to be in the Shore area, so we moved here. I was in the real estate business for forty-six years, thirty-seven years as a broker. I've seen quite a few changes. I came down first in 1934, and one of the changes was my playing golf. I got interested in golf.  I was a broker for the first golf course in Monmouth County, Howell Park. I made my second hole-in-one there.    Ms. Higgins: Oh, did you?    Mr. Lindemann: So, now they have seven golf courses, I believe.    Ms. Higgins: Very beautiful ones, too. The county park system is wonderful.    Mr. Lindemann: And the Howell Park was in Golf Digest Magazine. It is listed as one of the fifty best public courses in the nation.    Ms. Higgins: Well, we might as well start out talking about something controversial: the golf course is a county golf course. It has been regarded by some people as an unnecessary luxury that the county sponsors. How do you respond to that criticism?    Mr. Lindemann: Well, I sold the land, the 300 acres, to the county. There was a need for it because there hadn't been any golf courses built, and the golf courses were being sold to builders, so there was a real need. But now, I am of the opinion that the courses should be sold.    Ms. Higgins: All of them?    Mr. Lindemann: All of them.    Ms. Higgins: No more county golf courses?    Mr. Lindemann: No, I don't think it is good for any government business to be into private business. There has been quite a bit of controversy about the people who don't play golf who are supporting the golf courses. I don't think they make much money. They don't pay any taxes, they have rangers riding around. I played Old Orchard for years, and there was no ranger riding around. But the public has a point there, that the courses should be sold.    Ms. Higgins: How about Seven Presidents Park? That's a county park.    Mr. Lindemann: Yes, well, that is a little different because that is used by everybody.    Ms. Higgins: Everybody likes the seashore. (Laugh.) That's an interesting distinction.    Mr. Lindemann: Well, yes.    Ms. Higgins:  Did you ever run for public office?    Mr. Lindemann: Yes, I ran for Monmouth Regional Board of Education. And I made out well. I was the top go-getter for Eatontown. And then, I was in the real estate business, and my business wasn't progressing too well, and I resigned. I hated to do it ,but family came first. So, I was on the first Monmouth Regional Board of Education.    Ms. Higgins: Was Monmouth Regional the first regional high school in the area?    Mr. Lindemann: No, I believe there were other ones. I can't recall, but I don't think we were the first. But I've belonged to a church for fifty-two years: the Hope Church of Tinton Falls. I was also a member of the Shrewsbury Church for eight years: the one on Sycamore Avenue.    Ms. Higgins: Have you lived here in Eatontown almost all the time you've been in Monmouth County?    Mr. Lindemann: Yes.    Ms. Higgins: Eatontown is a nice town.    Mr. Lindemann: Yes, I love it. I love it.    Ms.Higgins: With satisfactory growth?    Mr. Lindemann: Oh, yes. We have quite a few apartments. I've seen that transition. I think there are over 3,000 apartments in Eatontown. And, in my real estate business, I have seen the transition of the farming industry. There were quite a few dairy farms years ago. Now, I believe there is only one large one left, in Upper Freehold Township.    Ms. Higgins:  Did this area have dairy farms?    Mr. Lindemann: Not necessarily in Eatontown, but throughout the county. I have sold real estate throughout Monmouth County and part of Ocean County, but years ago, in the farming area and Farmingdale area in Marlboro, they sold marl and shipped it all over the United States.     Ms. Higgins: What is marl?    Mr. Lindemann: It's a green soil, which had terrific properties. That's how Marlboro got its name. And there are pits. I remember one place I had for sale was a big pit made for digging marl.    Ms. Higgins: Is it a sediment kind of thing?    Mr. Lindemann: Yes.    Ms. Higgins: What is it used for?    Mr. Lindemann: To enhance soil.    Ms. Higgins: Okay.    Mr. Lindemann: And then way back in the history of the county, Monmouth County was one of the biggest potato counties in the East. They shipped potatoes all over in big barrels. That's all gone now.    Ms. Higgins: As you went through your life here in Monmouth County, how did you express yourself? If you saw something that needed done or you wanted to make a change, how did you make those opinions known?    Mr. Lindemann: Well, I have been a great one for going to the Town meetings, and I have been writing letters to editors. That has been my hobby all my life.    Ms. Higgins: I've seen many.    Mr. Lindemann: The Asbury Park Press honored me for sixty-two years of writing letters to the editors of the press. They called me down to the meeting, and they had about thirty people there who write letters. And the editor asked how many have been writing to the Press for five years, and then ten, twenty, thirty. There was only one hand up when he said sixty, that was mine. (Laughs)    Ms. Higgins: Well, congratulations!    Mr. Lindemann: And, when I came down here, there was in the Sea Bright area, a little town called Galilee. They had teams of horses that would pull the fishing boats out of the ocean, in Galilee. Have you ever heard of that?    Ms. Higgins: Where was this Galilee?    Mr. Lindemann:  It is near Sea Bright.    Ms. Higgins: Why would they need to pull the boats?    Mr. Lindemann: Well, bringing in the crop of fish. You know.    Ms. Higgins: Teams of horses?    Mr. Lindemann: Teams of horses pulling the boats. That had just discontinued shortly before I came down. And then, there was a railroad track running through Sea Bright. I don't know how far down it went along the coast, but that was abandoned.     Ms. Higgins:  Do you know Les Whitfield?    Mr. Lindemann: Yes.    Ms. Higgins: Well, he told me the track used to run all the way out to the Colts Neck. And they had the ammunition out there as well. Isn't that interesting? The horses pulling the fishing boats.  Well, what major events do you remember taking place down here in Monmouth County?    Mr. Lindemann: Well, I think one of the big ones was when Monmouth College ceased the Long Branch High School night classes and bought Shadow Lawn in the 1950s. I don't know the exact year. When I was working as a salesman, I had it for sale for $400,000. The funniest thing, I think it was a Mr. Reedy, I'm not sure: But he came into the office one day and said, "We want to buy a piece of land to build a University." And I took him out in the car and on the way I said, "We have the Shadow Lawn for sale for $400,000." He said, "We've been talking to them." So that cut me out completely. The next week they bought it. I kind of figured they thought we might sell it out from under them.    Ms. Higgins: Well, again, the people I've interviewed have said they were graduates of Monmouth Junior College or Monmouth College, depending on their age, and it has been a very influential part of our county.    Mr. Lindemann: Yes, my son graduated from there.    Ms. Higgins: Do you remember Brookdale?    Mr. Lindemann: Yes. It was a transition.    Ms. Higgins: Brookdale was a big, big farm, wasn't it?    Mr. Lindemann: Yes.    Ms. Higgins: Did you have that one on your list?    Mr. Lindemann: I wasn't involved in that. The mall in Eatontown was a forty acre cornfield. I remember that. And, it was sold for the shopping center, I believe for $140,000.    Ms. Higgins: Do you think that has been a big help in Eatontown?    Mr. Lindemann: Oh yes, yes. I also remember World War II. Fort Monmouth was flooded with soldiers training. And they would go long lines on Wyckoff Road from the Fort out for hikes. And almost daily.    Ms. Higgins: Military hikes?    Mr. Lindemann: Training hikes.    Ms. Higgins: And they had to train on the road?    Mr. Lindemann: Well, they had them hiking on the road. The Army made them hike to strengthen their legs and everything.    Ms. Higgins: What is your opinion of the industrial parks that followed the developments of the mall?    Mr. Lindemann: Oh, they have done well. I have seen that transition.  I saw the Parkway come.    Ms. Higgins: How did that change your life?    Mr. Lindemann: It didn't change mine much, but the people who owned property on the highway figured, "Oh my goodness, all the traffic is going to be gone from the highway," but it worked out just the opposite. Before the Parkway, you could buy some highway frontage for twenty dollars a front foot, which is very cheap.    Mr. Lindemann: With all the people coming down in the area, property prices just skyrocketed. The Parkway actually helped those people who thought they were going to get hurt.    Ms. Higgins: Were your children educated here in Monmouth County?    Mr. Lindemann: Well, my son went to Long Branch High School, and then Monmouth Regional was built. He finished his last year there. He then went to Monmouth College, graduated and went to work at IBM. He has been with them for thirty-one years. He is ready to retire. He has done very well.    Ms. Higgins: Does he live around here?    Mr. Lindemann: No. He is up in Hyde Park, NY. And then my daughter went into nursing. She graduated from Saint Luke's Hospital Training in New York. She has five children. Incidentally, this Christmas, I watched the Christmas Eve at Saint Peter's, although I'm not Catholic. My grandson went in to the Ministry for receiving priesthood, and then he gave it up after a year and became a stockbroker. At thirty-six years of age, he decided to go in for priesthood again, and he went out to Illinois for a year. They transferred him to Belgium.    Ms. Higgins: Is he a priest?    Mr. Lindemann: Not yet, but after Christmas Eve, he and sixteen students had communion with the Pope. My daughter was up last Saturday, and she brought a picture of him receiving a rosary from the Pope. I told Nancy, "You've got to get me a copy of that picture." I believe the ministry is the greatest profession, helping people slide into the great beyond, right? How much more can you have in life, right?    Mr. Higgins: Yes.    Mr. Lindemann: I have been very fortunate in life. I outlived three brothers. They all died in their seventies. I just wrote the Mayo brothers. A friend and I were eating lunch today and I was telling him that I've been typing all my adult life. When you throw a stone in a pond, it creates ripples to both shores, right?    Ms. Higgins: Yes.    Mr. Lindemann: I think that typing is what caused me to live to ninety-two. I wrote Mayo to check it out. I think that typing each day stirred my blood a little bit, right?    Ms. Higgins: And all the muscles went out like your pond.    Mr. Lindemann: I was in the hospital a week or so ago, and I was sitting in the lobby where they have the television for the public. The lady told me that her mother said that her hands and her feet were stirring the blood. I think I've got something there.    Ms. Higgins: Well, you know, women in general, live longer than men. And so much of what we do is knitting and little things like that.    Mr. Lindemann: Washing and all that.    Ms. Higgins: That's a fascinating theory, Mr. Lindemann. You are not only ninety-two, but you are vigorous and healthy. You look healthy, and you get around, and that's the way to be ninety-two.    Mr. Lindemann: Thanks. I have a different theory. I wrote to Mayo Brothers about it too. You know Bill Bradley and his heart trouble?  I'll tell you what I think. He played basketball at top speed for four years in high school, four years in Princeton, and, I think twelve years with the Knicks. Mrs. Joyner, the Olympic sprinter, died at age thirty-six. Walter Payton, the Chicago football player, the greatest, almost died at forty-three. Chamberlain died at sixty-five. And Catfish Hunter, the pitcher, died at sixty-five. And, you know something? When I was in high school, I told my brother I was going to be a professional baseball player. I was a good baseball player. He said, "They all die young." He discouraged me, you know? This isn't for the book, I don't think, but it is for passing on to somebody.    Ms. Higgins: It's a very interesting theory, it really is.    Mr. Lindemann:  I had two grandsons who played football in high school in South Jersey, and they would go and press the iron, you know, on the machine. And all that running in basketball games at top speed all the time is not good for the heart, I don't think. A man once told me that there are only so many beats in a heart. And I have heard it all my life that  ballplayers die young, which is true.    Ms. Higgins: So you played baseball? What was baseball like around here when you were playing? Were you playing here?    Mr. Lindemann: Well, no. I just played baseball out in Wisconsin when I was in high school. But, I have been trying to figure out how I could outlive three brothers who had lived good lives. They didn't drink or anything like that. And I figure this typing with the fingers all the time, almost everyday, may have helped  me.    Ms. Higgins: If that is true, we are going to have the longest living people in the world soon. We are all typing on our computers. I wanted to ask you about restaurants in the area back in the 1940s and 1930s, around the War. What restaurants in this area did you like to go to in the 1930s and 1940s?    Mr. Lindemann: Well, we were raising two children, and we didn't go out to eat too much.    Ms. Higgins:  I guess that's what made it special when people went out.    Mr. Lindemann: Now it's just the opposite. Everybody wants to go out and eat. I don't recall going out too much.    Ms. Higgins: Okay. What about movies? Were there opportunities to see movies and dance and theatre in Monmouth County?    Mr. Lindemann: You won't believe this. I have only been to two movie houses in forty years.    Ms. Higgins: Mr. Lindemann, I'm shocked. (Laughs)    Mr. Lindemann: (Laughs) And I don't read fiction books. I read nothing but nonfiction.    Ms. Higgins: Do you like the theatre, live theatre? Dance, or symphony music?    Mr. Lindemann: No, I don't. My hobbies all through life have been reading and writing.    Ms. Higgins: And, of course, your real estate. You were very astute at that.    Mr. Lindemann: I made out well and I saw the changes of how the apartment buildings came. We have over 3,000 apartments in Eatontown.    Ms. Higgins: Do the owners have children that go to schools? Does Eatontown support the schools?    Mr. Lindemann: Oh yes. They do well. We have good schools.    Ms. Higgins: My niece is thinking of moving over to Broad Street. I want to ask your opinion about some of the things that have been going on here in Monmouth County. A few years ago, there was a heated debate over trash disposal and incineration, yet they never even had a study done.    Mr. Lindemann: I was writing a column for a paper, The Wall Herald, for three and a half years. And Freeholder Narozanick called me one time. He said, "We've got a bus load of people going up to Westchester County to inspect an incinerator. We'd like to have you go along." So, I went there and the incinerators were working, but I couldn't see any stuff coming out of them. So, at lunch time, I asked the superintendent, who was giving a little talk, why I didn't see any smoke coming out of the incinerator. He said that that's all been taken care of. But then our incinerator project got defeated badly and they spent $400,000 on the research. But that happens in life. Between the landfill and the incinerators, we are facing crises all over the country, and unless we cut down on the use of products, we are going to be in terrible shape. Our country is creating twenty-five percent of the pollution of the world, and we only have four percent of the population. We are the culprits causing this global warming problem. I think an incinerator is better than a landfill, because the landfill creates odors in the neighborhood. I know that for the one out here, they bought all kinds of property, a whole stretch of property around it, just because there are odors, and you can't get rid of those odors.    Ms. Higgins: Isn't there leaking also?    Mr. Lindemann: Yes, into the water table.     Ms. Higgins: We saw incinerators in Europe and the operation looked very clean. They were using energy generators to provide electricity for the town. This was energy from the decomposition.    Mr. Lindemann: This must have been going on way before Jesus' time. Micah said, "The land shall become desolate because of the people therein."    Ms. Higgins: Yes, it's a shame when you see that. Well, do you remember any ice boating on the Navesink?    Mr. Lindemann: Yes, we've had the mild winters so that has died out, but that was quite a thing, the races.    Ms. Higgins: Were you a boater at all?    Mr. Lindemann: No, I wasn't. I didn't participate in that.    Ms. Higgins: We saw the ice boats on the Navesink River once in the 1950s. Can you think of other major projects that the county was involved in?  Or that you was involved in as an individual?    Mr. Lindemann: I think they've done a great job with the Brookdale and they've done a great job with the golf courses, but I feel that they should be sold now. And the Freeholders have done a lot of wonderful things. That's why they are voted back in all the time. And you know when you look back, I think Joe Irwin was the director for about thirty years. He and Harry Larrison directed for about thirty-five years? This county is one of the greatest Republican counties in the United States. We had the five Freeholders. We have the senators. We have the assembly people, Ms. Derringer and Dr. Smith and all that. We have all the representatives in the assembly. We have the sheriff. It's solid Republicans. This is one of the strongest Republican counties in the United States right now.      Ms. Higgins: How about Governor Whitman? Are you for her?    Mr. Lindemann: Well, you know, all these people now, like the President last night, are submitting budgets higher than last year. Mrs. Whitman's budget is six percent higher. The inflation is only about three percent. And each year, those budgets are all higher than the previous year, every year. I don't get it.    Ms. Higgins: Could it simply be numbers? You know there are more people, more employees in the county and state government.     Mr. Lindemann: You've got a point.  Mrs. Whitman's budget is a six and a quarter percent higher, the president's is about six percent higher, and the county is six percent higher.    Ms. Higgins: Well, as they say, that could just be because they are administering more acreage. The county has bought a lot more acres. The employment rolls are up because we need more teachers, more policemen, and so on.    Mr. Lindemann: I have a friend, Lou Herring, who has been in a nursing home in Eatontown. I am ashamed to say it, but I haven't been over to see him. The last I knew he was ninety-eight, but  I don't know what shape he is in right now.  I've had my own problems. I've been in the hospital twice in the last year, but I've been very fortunate in life, very fortunate. I had a little hernia operation, that's all. I used to go down to the beach every day for years when I had my car.    Ms. Higgins: Which beach?    Mr. Lindemann: Seven President's Park, the County Park. I would be down there in the wintertime. I'd be down there walking up and down the beach, and I talked to about 5,000 people in thirteen years. I catered to college students and high school students. I recited a little poem, "Go to college. Get that knowledge. Stay there until you are through. If they can make penicillin out of moldy bread, they can make something out of you." (Laughs) You know, when I went to the hospital a couple of years ago for a hernia operation, I got a card from the beach signed by fifteen young people.    Ms. Higgins: Oh!!!    Mr. Lindemann: I got to them right over here. You can't buy that for three million dollars in the drug store.     Ms. Higgins: That's really neat. Speaking of the boardwalks and all. There are some people who want the boardwalks to remain made of wood, and there are other people that like it made out of recycled material. There are some boardwalks that have a little of each. What is your opinion on that?    Mr. Lindemann: It's hard to beat wood, I think. But maybe the other material lasts longer, I don't know.    Ms. Higgins: Yes, I think it does.  Where did you go to school out in Wisconsin?    Mr. Lindemann: Juneau, Wisconsin. A little bit of a town.    Ms. Higgins: And did you go to college?    Mr. Lindemann: No, I just took two courses at the University of Wisconsin.    Ms. Higgins: How did you get into Shakespeare?    Mr. Lindemann: Well, reading and writing have been my hobby all my life.  Do you see that set of books on the right on the top shelf, the big set?    Ms. Higgins: Yes.    Mr. Lindemann: That's Carl Sandburg's Life of Lincoln. The war years and prairie years, 3,000 pages. I have read that three times. That's 9,000 pages I read.    Ms. Higgins: That's one I've always wanted to read.    Mr. Lindemann: Lincoln is my favorite president. He was great. He said, "Why should the spirit of mortal be proud.?" That was his favorite saying, but I don't think I can give you any more information. I tried to rack my brain for different things. I saw the transition in Monmouth County, but it is hard to describe it.    Ms. Higgins: Yes, yes. Well, that story about the horses is a fascinating one. Do you remember how any medical practices may have changed in the past fifty or sixty years in Monmouth County?    Mr. Lindemann: Well, the hospitals have grown tremendously. And I keep away from doctors. I figure if I go to a doctor he'll give me something to make me sick. (Laughs)    Ms. Higgins: What would you say has been one of your greatest achievements?    Mr. Lindemann: Well, I would think my influence on those people on the beach is one of my greatest achievements. I can go down to the beach and people know me.  I have walked up to people and talked to people.  I walk up to people and say, "Who put all that water there?" (Laughs) Then they laugh. A lady said, "Oh, I think it was left over from Noah's flood." (Laughs) And that's the way it goes. And then one fellow said to me that all his life he has worried about how the clouds are held up in the sky. Now I have been asking that question to people. I can't figure it out.     Ms. Higgins: I don't know, either.    Mr. Lindemann: And I ask people. How are the Pacific Ocean and the Atlantic Ocean stuck to a round ball? Well, they say, "That's gravity." "Well," I say, "Go home and put some water on a ball and see if you can keep it on the ball." (Laughs) I ask questions about golf. Do you ever play golf?    Ms. Higgins: No.    Mr. Lindemann: I played for thirty years, twice a week.  I didn't ride a cart. I think that's one of the things that has helped me live to be ninety-two. And I say to people, when golfers putt in the United States, the ball goes down in a hole, right?    Ms. Higgins: Right, that's the game plan.    Mr. Lindemann: Now in Australia, underneath us, does the ball go up in the hole? So I wrote this to the Star-Ledger, and they put a big cartoon in the center of the page. They showed the world and a guy on top putting, and a guy underneath putting up. And then I had a little sentence at the end. And I said, "That's why people have been going to church, and synagogues, and mass for years, and will continue to do so." They put that cartoon right in the center of the paper. I must have had twelve cartoons in the Star Ledger.    Ms. Higgins: Have you ever thought of collecting all your letters and having them edited?    Mr. Lindemann: Well, I wrote a book. I had it copyrighted in Washington. It is in the files in Washington. You might find something in there about the county. I have to be careful, my legs are giving out. I had an inner ear problem, which causes instability.     Ms. Higgins: The County Percolator is the name of the book.    Mr. Lindemann: It's really corny, a lot of jokes and everything.    Ms. Higgins: It is copyrighted 1990 and has the Library of Congress number.     Mr. Lindemann: I sent it in to a couple of places to have it published, but I got a return slip. (Laughs) You can copy anything out of there.    Ms. Higgins: Thank you very much. Just a few more questions of a general nature. What concerns you most about the state of the world today?    Mr. Lindemann: I tell you, I watched the President last night. (I'm a Republican from way back.) He said that we're better off than we've ever been. He's not right. We are awash in gambling. All the states are into it. Drugs, alcohol, too. 15,000 people killed on the highways each year because of drugs. I've been trying to get alcohol off the airways. Pornography. It's terrible what's on the airways. People flying into bed with each other all the time, and children seeing that. It's not right. And the violence. People say our nation is going down the drain morally. You've heard that haven't you?    Ms. Higgins: Yes.    Mr. Lindemann: And he says we're better off. Better off economically probably, but morally, we're going down the drain. So, I think you will find a few things in the book you can use.    Ms. Higgins: If people listen to this or read it, maybe fifty, seventy, one hundred years from now, what kind of advice would you want to give to future generations?    Mr. Lindemann: That's a good question. It requires a little thought. I think I personally feel that there is a supreme being. I have gone to church regularly for sixty years every week almost. I was at church last Sunday. I had a lady take me to church.     Ms. Higgins: You've been an active member of the Friends of the Monmouth County Library. Whenever we need something done, we call on the Friends.     Mr. Lindemann: I can't attend the meetings anymore if I don't have a car, but they have done good work.    Ms. Higgins: Yes, they have done a lot for the county.    Mr. Lindemann: Do you have grandchildren?    Ms. Higgins: Six, and we have a great granddaughter.    Mr. Lindemann: Well, you will have some information in that book that will help you. I taught my son and my daughter to read before they got into kindergarten. Six months, half an hour a day with the phonics. I think it was a terrible thing when the Federal Government got into education. That was the worst thing they could do. They started in with the new math. Remember the new math? The parents couldn't figure it out. Then they switched to the sight-reading, and now millions can't read. I give somebody something to read, and I could read it in half the time that they take to read it.    Ms. Higgins: Are they back to phonics now?    Mr. Lindemann: They're trying to get back into it. Now they are coming out with a new new math. The Federal Government should have never gotten into education. They've ruined the education system, I think. The first thing they decided was that you have to give the children liberty in the classroom, and let them walk around. That was the worst thing they could have done. I went over to the mall when I had my car everyday. I'd go to the beach in the morning, and I would be in the mall in the afternoon.  I got a college education in the mall just by talking to people. One old man told me that when he went to school, he had to sit still and be quiet, and if he didn't behave, he got a whipping and then he would get one at home, too. The people supported the teachers. Now, the teachers are at fault.    Ms. Higgins: You must have found being on the Board of Education somewhat frustrating at times.    Mr. Lindemann: Well, I wasn't on it long enough. It's unfortunate, I really hated to quit it, but my business was going downhill thinking about the schools all the time, and my family came first, so I resigned.  I blame all our problems in this country on the Federal Government.    Ms. Higgins: And you are a decentralist?    Mr. Lindemann: Yes.    Ms. Higgins: But Abraham Lincoln, your favorite president, held the Union together.    Mr. Lindemann: Yes, he did it. He made a speech just before the war ended and he said, "With malice towards none  with charity for all  with firmness in the right, as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in  to bind up the nation's wounds  to care for him who shall have born the battle, and for his widow, and his orphan, and achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves and all nations." You know before that speech, they called him every name in the book: "gorilla," "warmonger," everything. After that, they were sorry when he got killed the next week, because they knew he wouldn't give retribution. Those words in the beginning of that speech, "With malice towards none and charity for all," bound the south and north together again. He was a great one, and you know he only went to school one year.    Ms. Higgins: Really?    Mr. Lindemann: And he educated himself on the Bible. He would lay in front of a wood stove and the red coals provided the light for him to read.     Ms. Higgins: Do you remember that when Lincoln was killed Reconstruction was quite regarded as being quite harsh in the South? I don't think Lincoln would have been that harsh.    Mr. Lindemann: No, they really gave the South the shaft, terribly. And that wouldn't have happened if Lincoln were in charge.    Ms. Higgins: So Mr. Lindemann, we are about out of our time here. It has been such a pleasure. (Offers to shake hands.)    Mr. Lindemann:  I am not shaking hands with people anymore.  All the churches now have people shake hands during the service. I think that's the worst thing they can do. A man in the mall who's a member of a church in Whiting with 6,000 members told me the priest said, "Don't shake hands with the people." In the New York Times, they had an article that said, "Hand shaking has lost its grip." (Laughs) And they quoted a Boston medical group as saying that a multitude of diseases are spread by hand shaking. We got rid of the kissing of the mouth. We are going to get rid of the hand shaking. It's coming. Donald Trump doesn't shake hands with anybody.    Ms. Higgins: Thank you. This has been a lovely afternoon.    Mr. Lindemann: If you enjoyed it as much as I did, then we are even.

Would you tell us a little bit about how your people happened to get to New Jersey, how your family got to Monmouth County?   William Siegfried: Well, my father worked for the government as a clothing inspector. He inspected work of the various manufacturers whose uniforms used to go through inspections on Governors Island. Doing this, he became acquainted with the Eisner's of Red Bank, who were government contractors.  Flora Higgins: I interviewed a lady from Union Beach who was in her late eighties. She remembers taking the trolley to Eisner's. That was a very old name in Red Bank.   The Siegfried Family, 1910. (Left to right) William, Pauline, Milton, Gertie, Frank, Simon, and Ruth William Siegfried: Oh, sure, yes.  Flora Higgins: Can you tell us what it was like being a boy in Red Bank at the turn of the century?  What games did you play? Who were your playmates?  William Siegfried: Well, I started school in Red Bank and graduated from high school.  Flora Higgins: How did you get to school? Did you have to walk to school? Was it far?  William Siegfried: No. I only had four or five blocks to walk, and when I went to high school, that wasn't far. I lived on Linden Place in Red Bank.  Flora Higgins: Can you tell us a bit more about that school? Did you work pretty hard in school?  William Siegfried: Oh, they kept us very busy.  Flora Higgins: Did you study Latin?  William Siegfried: Yes.  Flora Higgins: You were probably just about graduating when World War I started. Would that be about right?  Arthur Siegfried: He worked at Eisner's before the war.  William Siegfried: Yes, I started at Eisner's on a part time basis, and when I graduated from high school, I assumed permanent employment there. That was my first employment. From there I started to get acquainted with some railroad people. I had a brother who was an engineer, and so I assumed the task of learning telegraphy.  Flora Higgins: That's a very necessary skill, and in fact, they did not draft telegraphers did they?   William Siegfried: Well, telegraphy was even more important than the telephone at that time.  Flora Higgins: Did you become a dispatcher?  William Siegfried: Yes.  Flora Higgins: Do you know Lester Whitfield?  William Siegfried: The name is very familiar.  Flora Higgins: His history is very much like yours in some ways. He learned telegraphy and then he became a dispatcher and he's a great proponent of railroads. Do you think we need more railroads around here?  William Siegfried: Do we need more? I don't think so they have plenty of trackage. All they need is more motor power.  Flora Higgins: And more places to put the cars when they get to the train station!  Arthur Siegfried: Who else worked in Eisner's from the family?  William Siegfried: Well, my father's connection with Eisner's is how we came to move to Red Bank. We moved to Red Bank from New York City. And I started there while I was in high school. I used to go there after school for a couple of hours. And when I graduated high school, I worked there full time.  Flora Higgins: How much did you get paid?  William Siegfried: Seven dollars a week.  Flora Higgins: Well, I hope you didn't spend it all in one place. How did you spend your money in Red Bank? Was there a movie house in Red Bank?  William Siegfried: Oh, there were movie houses. Then there was a place they used to call the YMCA that was down on the border, and they had roller skating there.  Flora Higgins: Did you like to roller skate?  William Siegfried: Oh, sure.  Flora Higgins: Oh, what happened to the YMCA?  William Siegfried: I used to work there. I would help the people put their skates on and take them off.  Flora Higgins: This is the first I have heard of that place. I think it would be nice to have it now for the young people.  William Siegfried: Sure, yes, good clean fun.  Flora Higgins: Good fun. Do you remember any ice boating?  William Siegfried: Oh, sure. They used to have ice boating in the winter, and then in the summer there would be sail boating.  Flora Higgins: Does it seem to you the winters were colder then?    Picture of Red Bank's first Boy Scout troop. The picture was published in 1942, but was taken in 1910. William Siegfried: Oh yes, we cleaned snow from the sidewalks in the winter time. Broad Street was a dirt road. The only places that they had the planks were the crosswalks. So we youngsters used to go down there during the inclement weather with our mothers' brooms and clean the walks. They had sidewalks from one side of the road to the other. We used to keep that clean, and we'd get the pennies from the people going across.  Flora Higgins: Sort of like a little toll.  Arthur Siegfried: Did Mr. Eisner give you money when you swept the road?  William Siegfried: Oh sure, practically everyone would contribute.  William Siegfried: What did you do with the money then?  William Siegfried: Oh, I'd give it to my mother, and she would put it away for us. It would accumulate.  Arthur Siegfried: Did you go to the cemetery?  William Siegfried: Yes, I used to go. I used to accompany my father to the cemetery and we would level off the ground and straighten out the various plots.  Arthur Siegfried: How old were you then?  William Siegfried: Oh, eight to ten years old.  Arthur Siegfried: And where was the cemetery?  William Siegfried: In Lincroft.  Arthur Siegfried: And which cemetery was it?  William Siegfried: Well there was only one cemetery, The Hebrew Burial Ground.  Flora Higgins: Is that cemetery still there?   Arthur Siegfried: It's B'nai Israel Congregation Cemetery now, and it is still there. His father was one of the founders of the cemetery and of the synagogue. How did you get to the cemetery from Red Bank?  William Siegfried: Well, there was a family the name of Dixon. They had a buggy and a horse, and they used to pick us up at Red Bank and take us out there, and we would do the various chores around the grounds. Then they took us home.  Flora Higgins: So were the Dixons involved in founding the cemetery as well as your father?   William Siegfried: They were one of the originators. When they first bought the ground they were the promoters.  Flora Higgins: Did your family have a sense that they were starting up life in a community that would become the Red Bank like it is today?   William Siegfried: Well, we used to go to New York from Red Bank every couple of weeks to do shopping.  Flora Higgins: Did you take the train?  William Siegfried: Yes.  Arthur Siegfried: Did you drive to New York, too?  William Siegfried: Oh, yes, after a while when we were able to, when the cars started coming into use, we would use the car to go to New York, and we'd go over there, and my father would do the shopping.  Arthur Siegfried: What did he shop for?  William Siegfried: Groceries.  Arthur Siegfried: Why did he go to New York for groceries?  William Siegfried: Well, my mother was a great cook and there were a lot of things that were not obtainable in Red Bank, so he would shop over in New York on the East side.  Flora Higgins: I think to this day there are people who need specialty items that go into New York to get them even now.  William Siegfried: I wouldn't be a bit surprised, yes.  Flora Higgins: Is your family any relation to the Siegfried Hardware Store in Atlantic Highlands?  William Siegfried: That's my brother.  Flora Higgins: Really! That's a wonderful store. We used to shop there a lot.  William Siegfried: Oh, really.  Flora Higgins: Yes, no matter what you wanted he had it and he knew where it was. It was wonderful! That was your brother.  Arthur Siegfried: I didn't know whether you were going to get into any parts of the family, but yes, Frank was his younger brother.  William Siegfried: Yes, he started the hardware business in Atlantic Highlands. He started from scratch.  Flora Higgins: And when he left he still had things that he had when he had started, I think. You could always get everything you wanted there.  Arthur Siegfried: Did you ever live in Highlands?  William Siegfried: Yes we did. My father got married the second time and his bride had seven houses there.  Flora Higgins: What was her name before she married?  William Siegfried: I don't remember her name.  Flora Higgins: That seems like a lot of property.  William Siegfried: She had seven houses, and they would all be rented in the summertime.  Arthur Siegfried: Did she live on the hill? The road that became the highway.  William Siegfried: Yes, they were all on that Route 36, not far from the bridge.  Flora Higgins: Actually, I used to live on Ocean Street. We had a big old Victorian house on Ocean Street, which is why we needed your brother's store.  William Siegfried: When I say bridge I'm thinking the current bridge, which is Highway 36, but I think that was built around 1940. It was the other bridge. Well amongst those seven houses there was always something to do, and she kept us busy.  Arthur Siegfried: When did he marry her?  William Siegfried: I don't remember the date.   Arthur Siegfried: Around 1920 or so.  William Siegfried: Yes.  Arthur Siegfried: Your mother died quite early on, didn't she? Do you remember how old you were?  William Siegfried: I was about fourteen when she passed away, so it was about 1910. Father got married about three or four years after my mother passed away.  Arthur Siegfried: Your mother was Pauline, and my middle name is Paul for her.  In Highlands were there people by the name of Schwartz? What can you tell us about them?  William Siegfried: Well they had a hardware store on Bay Avenue and Miller Street.  Flora Higgins: By the Rexall Drug Store, Bedles, remember Bedles?  William Siegfried: Sure.  Flora Higgins: We lived in Highlands a long time. I know the hardware store. In fact, the day that hardware store closed, I went down there and bought some charming things. We were all sorry when that store closed in the1960s or 1970s wasn't it? Was that Schwartz'?  William Siegfried: I don't know. There were other hardware stores there. In the 1960s or 1970s there was one…Kadenbach.  Flora Higgins: That's the one I'm thinking of!   Arthur Siegfried: All right, and then there was one, I think it was Banko, which my father bought out during the Korean War, but that's later. What was the name of Mr. or Mrs. Schwartz? I don't know if it's the same family, but I think it is some part. We used to visit one another. We were friends, but not too close.  Flora Higgins: Who visited them when you said, "We visited them?" Who's the 'we'?  William Siegfried: Oh, my father. We used to visit them and gradually built up a friendship.  Arthur Siegfried: How old were you when you visited them?  William Siegfried: I was in my teens.  Arthur Siegfried: Was Harry Schwartz one of their children?  William Siegfried: Well, Harry was his son. I don't know what's become of them.  Arthur Siegfried: Now was Harry the one that's Harry Swartz the doctor?   William Siegfried: Well, the doctor is from another branch in the family.  Flora Higgins: I see a lot of moving around. You've lived in Red Bank, and then you went to Highlands, and you went out to Lincroft. That's kind of a big distance with a horse and carriage and a bicycle.  William Siegfried: Well, we only made the one move from Red Bank when my father got married the second time and we moved to Highlands.  Flora Higgins: Do you remember what street you lived on in the Highlands?  William Siegfried:  Up on the hill. The highway.  Flora Higgins: All the houses were on the highway, that's right, you already told me that.  William Siegfried: There was a bridge there, the railroad bridge.  Flora Higgins: Apparently the trains were pretty important in the Bayshore area. They came and went to New York bringing people down to rent houses.  William Siegfried: When I was a youngster, the trains ran all the way through to Long Branch and down the shore. My new mother had seven houses on the highway. We used to work on them keeping them in condition.  Flora Higgins: Were they big houses or small houses?  William Siegfried: They were average houses. They had five or six rooms--they were the average size.  Flora Higgins: Did you enjoy clamming or going down to the river beach, or the ocean?  William Siegfried: We used to go bathing and fishing.  Flora Higgins: How old were you when you got married? How did you meet your first wife?  William Siegfried: Oh, I think I was about eighteen when I met my first wife. We were introduced by our two friends and we started dating.  When I first got married I was still working for the railroad.  Arthur Siegfried: And did Milton get you the job on the railroad?  William Siegfried: Yes.  Arthur Siegfried: How much older was he than you?  William Siegfried: Oh, he was about eight or ten years older.   William Siegfried (far left) with family Arthur Siegfried: And then Aunt Ruth was in there too? Who was the youngest, my father or Aunt Ruth?  William Siegfried: Aunt Ruth. Your father was the youngest. Milton was the oldest. And then me, and then Ruth.  Arthur Siegfried: And then my father.  William Siegfried: Yes, your father was the youngest.   Arthur Siegfried: How long did you live in Highlands with Aunt Bessie, your first wife?  William Siegfried: I don't think we lived there at all. We lived in Perth Amboy.  Arthur Siegfried: She was from Perth Amboy wasn't she?  William Siegfried: Yes.  Arthur Siegfried: Did you go into business before the Second World War or after?  William Siegfried: After.  Arthur Siegfried: Aunt Bessie died around 1940 or 1941, right?   William Siegfried and his daughter, Thelma  on beach         William Siegfried: Yes.  Arthur Siegfried: And when was your daughter Thelma born? Did she go in the service in the Second World War?  William Siegfried: Yes, she went in as a WAVE.  Flora Higgins: When you were in Perth Amboy, what business were you in?  William Siegfried: Auto supplies.  Flora Higgins: About how long did you live in Perth Amboy?  Arthur Siegfried: You were in business in Perth Amboy with Al weren't you? He did the inside work, and you did the running around.  William Siegfried: Al Allison.  Arthur Siegfried: Yes, that's the one. You were with him quite a long time.  William Siegfried: Oh yes, maybe twenty years.  Arthur Siegfried: Maybe thirty years before you sold out to Calabro, right? How did you know Aunt Gladys? You knew her from Perth Amboy.  William Siegfried: Oh, yes. I didn't meet her until after I lived in Perth Amboy.  Arthur Siegfried: And you got married to her.  William Siegfried: Yes. I lived on State Street in Perth Amboy. Gladys was a supervisor for the telephone company.  Arthur Siegfried: And she was a Dickson, right? A completely different family.  William Siegfried: Yes. This is a very fine Catholic family from the Manasquan area, but there is a whole bunch of them. There's many of them. That's the Dickson Supply Family.  Flora Higgins: Mr. Siegfried, when you were in Perth Amboy did you know someone named Rabbi Davidson?  William Siegfried: Sure. We were well acquainted.  Flora Higgins: Oh, I'm so happy to hear that.  William Siegfried: Was he related to you?  Flora Higgins: No, but his daughter Judith was my friend of the heart. She and I were very, very, very good friends and she spoke often of her father.  William Siegfried: Yes, we were very well acquainted.  Arthur Siegfried: When did you move in here, this house that were in now?   William Siegfried building his house William Siegfried: Around 1955.  Arthur Siegfried: Who built this house?  William Siegfried: Well, I had a friend who was a mason, and I got the plans. I supervised the whole thing. Bought all my own material.  Flora Higgins: Well, it's a very beautiful home.  William Siegfried: Thank you. Aunt Gertie was part of the Monmouth Schwartz family.  Arthur Siegfried: Which Schwartz family? From Highlands? From Keyport?  William Siegfried: No, it was Red Bank. It was the Schwartzs in Red Bank that had a used furniture store.   Arthur Siegfried: Was that Maurice Schwartz?  William Siegfried: Yes.  Arthur Siegfried: Is he the one that went into the car business or was that another one?  William Siegfried: Maurice went into the car business it was Schwartz Chrysler. The father had the furniture business. Maurice Schwartz, the car dealer, was the son of the brother to Milton's wife.  Arthur Siegfried: Now were they related to Harry Swartz the doctor?  William Siegfried: Yes. Harry Swartz is related.  Arthur Siegfried: Do you remember how they're related?  William Siegfried: Well, I think it was Harry's father who is the brother to the Schwartz who owned the furniture store. Aunt Gertie would be a cousin.  Arthur Siegfried: Now were there other Schwartz' around Keyport?  William Siegfried: No.  Arthur Siegfried: William did a lot in Perth Amboy with the Lions Club, and he did a lot with the Drum and Bugle Corps. He was in the Thanksgiving Parade.  Flora Higgins: Let's talk about that.   William Siegfried at the microphone Arthur Siegfried: What did you do in the Lions Club in Perth Amboy?   William Siegfried: What do you mean?  Arthur Siegfried: Well, you ran the Drum and Bugle Corps.  William Siegfried: Yes.  Arthur Siegfried: Did you organize it?  William Siegfried: Oh, I had all the working parts. I ran the Drum and Bugle Corps in Perth Amboy.  Arthur Siegfried: Did you have competitions with other drum and bugle Corps?  William Siegfried: Oh, sure. I even ran the competitions at the stadium in Perth Amboy. I had about fifteen drum corps coming in there and competing with one another.  Arthur Siegfried: That was around 1945 or 1949.  William Siegfried: Yes.  Arthur Siegfried: I remember going up there when my parents lived on Lincoln Avenue, maybe during the Second World War, because they moved out of there after the war.  Flora Higgins: Out of where?  Arthur Siegfried: It was 50 Lincoln Avenue, Atlantic Highlands. But I remember being picked up and going to Uncle William's competition. Did you take the drum and bugle Corps to Washington?  William Siegfried: Sure.  Arthur Siegfried: What did you do there?  William Siegfried: Well, we were at competitions.  Arthur Siegfried: How about the Macy's Parades?  William Siegfried: Oh, yes, we went there for many, many years.  Arthur Siegfried: Was that by invitation?   William Siegfried: Oh, sure.  Arthur Siegfried: Why did they invite you?  William Siegfried: Because we were an attraction.  Arthur Siegfried: Right. How many people were in your corps?  William Siegfried: We used to run about 105.  Flora Higgins: Good heavens! That's a big corps. Had you had musical training? Are you a musician?  William Siegfried: Well I used to have piano lessons when I was a youngster, but I didn't stick to it very long.  Flora Higgins: That's a big undertaking.  Arthur Siegfried: That was a huge thing.  William Siegfried: Yes, we used to travel all over.  Arthur Siegfried: Was your mother a good cook?  William Siegfried: Oh, she was, yes.  Flora Higgins: What would she cook?  William Siegfried: Hungarian. She was a very good cook.  Arthur Siegfried: Did she keep a kosher house?  William Siegfried: When we first moved to Red Bank, she kept a kosher house, but it wasn't too long before we switched. It became too difficult to get the right foods all the time.  Arthur Siegfried: When you went to New York did you bring back kosher foods?   William Siegfried: Oh, yes. I used to go by myself and do a lot of shopping.  Arthur Siegfried: Did you drive a car?  William Siegfried: In the beginning, I went by train. My father worked up around Westfield, New Jersey as a ticket agent.  Flora Higgins: Trains again.  William Siegfried: Yes.  Flora Higgins: Well, I see you've done many things: the auto business, and the drum and bugle Corps, and the train dispatcher. That was your major thing before you got married, and then you had the auto supply parts. When you and Bessie wanted to go out in the evening and have fun, where did you go?  William Siegfried: We used to go out to dinner once in a while. We lived in Perth Amboy. We used to come to Keyport to Ye Cottage Inn.  We used to go there quite a bit.  Flora Higgins: Great fish.  Arthur Siegfried: Do you remember Cooper Bridge from Red Bank to Middletown?  William Siegfried: Yes.  Arthur Siegfried: How do you remember that?

Where did you go to?  William Siegfried: We went to Florida for the first time.  Arthur Siegfried: With Aunt Gladys or Aunt Bessie?  William Siegfried: Aunt Gladys.  Arthur Siegfried: You used to tell us a story about being in an old Ford car with Aunt Ruth and Uncle Sam and the car tilted over.  William Siegfried: Oh yes. He had this old Model T, and some of the gears had worn, so that it turned too far, and the car turned over, but there was no one seriously hurt. Everybody was scratched and shaken up, but it wasn't serious.  Arthur Siegfried: Who was driving it?  William Siegfried: I think my brother Frank was driving.  Arthur Siegfried: There a time when Uncle Sam Greenblatt was driving it, and it tilted over. Remember that?  William Siegfried: Yes, that's right.  Arthur Siegfried: What was the story about that? The gears were worn?  William Siegfried: Sam didn't do much driving, but he drove this time, and he made too sharp a turn and the old Model T went over.  Arthur Siegfried: What happened when it went over? What did he say?  William Siegfried: He said, "Get me out, get me out." Yes, he was quite a crybaby, you know.  Arthur Siegfried: Did he work in Eisner's?  William Siegfried: Yes, my father got him in there.  Arthur Siegfried: And what did he do in Eisner's?  William Siegfried: He was like a foreman.  Arthur Siegfried: Was your father a tailor originally?   William Siegfried: Oh sure.  Arthur Siegfried: How come you didn't become a tailor?  William Siegfried: I don't know. I didn't take to it.  Arthur Siegfried: How did you get into the automotive business?  William Siegfried: Well, I was a telegraph operator, first. I worked on the railroad. Then I started to fool around with cars, you know, and that way I drifted into the automotive end.  Arthur Siegfried: Do you remember your first car?  William Siegfried: Yes, my first car was a Model T.  Arthur Siegfried: Where did you get it?  William Siegfried: I bought it from a dealer in Red Bank.  Arthur Siegfried: Where were you living at that time?  William Siegfried: We lived on McLaren Street in Red Bank.  Arthur Siegfried: Before you lived on McLaren Street, where did you live?

Flora Higgins: How about Kislin's? Do you remember Kislin's Department Store?  William Siegfried: Yes, he came in towards the end of my term.  Flora Higgins: If you could say anything to all the people who are coming along in the next one hundred years and give them some advice, what kind of advice would you like to give the next generations?  William Siegfried: Well, there are so many things that are happening, so many improvements mechanically, and otherwise, it is quite difficult to anticipate, because the many things that are happening are really surprising. It's hard to predict what might come. I think it is difficult to anticipate what will happen.  Arthur Siegfried: Do you remember Hendrickson and Applegate Store? It was the old hardware store on Front Street near the Hotel.  William Siegfried: Yes, I remember the store.  Arthur Siegfried: Do you remember anything about it? It was an old hardware store that my father had bought around 1948 when they went out of business. Do you remember any of the old lawyers like Reussille?  William Siegfried: Well, he was a jeweler.

Flora Higgins: And then he moved out to Colts Neck.  William Siegfried: Way, way back.  Flora Higgins: Yes 1950s. Why are you laughing, Mr. Arthur Siegfried?  Arthur Siegfried: What was the other Becker? There were two Beckers weren't there? They had hardware stores on Shrewsbury Ave.?  William Siegfried: I only remember the one.

William Siegfried: Seems I don't remember anything about it.  Arthur Siegfried: How about the fishing over by Belford or Fort Monmouth: do you remember any of that?  William Siegfried: No.  Arthur Siegfried: You may not have been there.  Milton and Gertrude had two children, one Arnold Siegfried. He was in the Air Corps in the Second World War and then had a hardware store in Matawan after the war. Then he went back in the Air Corps and relocated to the Washington DC area. His sister, Thelma, was married to Martin Rush, the pathologist. When he died, she married a gentleman by the name of Harry Cole. She now lives with one of her daughters in Wilmington, Delaware.   Flora Higgins: It seems like a very close family.   William Siegfried: Yes, we are all over the place. Aunt Ruth, Ruth and Sam as I know them, had two children, one, Morton Greenblatt, was killed in the Second World War. He was a navigator on a plane. The other one was married once and divorced in the early 1940s, and then she married a fellow by the name of Murray Gast who was related to the Hess family. They had a bar in Perth Amboy. There's a son, Michael Gast, who is probably around fifty, who was an attorney around New Brunswick, and then there's two girls who have moved away. I'm not familiar with them.  Flora Higgins: It's hard to keep them all straight. Mr. Siegfried, can you tell us what you felt when the Second World War came? What were some of the changes around here?  William Siegfried: Oh, yes. Strange as it might seem, I don't recall too many changes. People seem to take everything for granted.  Arthur Siegfried: Do you remember the gas shortage in the Second World War? We rationed gasoline and sugar, also. We had little coupon books.  William Siegfried: I don't remember that.  Arthur Siegfried: Do you remember my mother's family store in Atlantic Highlands?  William Siegfried: Sure.  Arthur Siegfried: What do you remember about that?

Arthur Siegfried: How about the Mandelay Boat?  William Siegfried: Well, strange as it might seem, I've never been on it.   Arthur Siegfried: That hasn't been around in a long time anyway. How about the boats that used to go to Red Bank up the river?  William Siegfried: Oh, there used to be the Seabird and the Albertina.  Flora Higgins: Did you ever go on them?  William Siegfried: Oh, sure. I used to sell confections on the boat.  Flora Higgins: Oh, did you? You are the most industrious person.  William Siegfried: And then when I went to work for the railroad they'd put me on 42nd Street where the boats used to dock. I used to sell tickets there.  Arthur Siegfried: Why did they put you there?  William Siegfried: Well, I worked for the railroad.  Arthur Siegfried: And you went wherever they told you to go?  William Siegfried: Sure.  Arthur Siegfried: Did they have any unions then?  William Siegfried: Yes. I wasn't involved with them.  Arthur Siegfried: Why?  William Siegfried: I don't know.  Arthur Siegfried: Do you remember a merry-go-round in Highlands?  Flora Higgins: I remember that! It was beautiful. I was so sad when it burned down.  William Siegfried: Yes, I remember that.  Arthur Siegfried: Did you ever ride it? Did people take you there or did you walk there? How did you get to it?  William Siegfried: I always had a car.  Arthur Siegfried: Do you remember Hudson Springs in Atlantic Highlands?   William Siegfried: I don't remember.   Flora Higgins: I think I'm going to ask just a couple more questions. Did you have any other questions Mr. Siegfried?  Arthur Siegfried: Do you remember the book From Indian Trail to Electric Rail? Do you remember anything about Buttermilk Valley near Highlands? How about the trolley from Atlantic Highlands to Red Bank or to Highlands through Campbell's Junction?  William Siegfried: Oh, yes, I used to ride them.  Arthur Siegfried: Why?  William Siegfried: I must have had places to go.  Arthur Siegfried: Where did you get on it?  William Siegfried: Red Bank.  Arthur Siegfried: And where did you go?  William Siegfried: I used to go to Atlantic Highlands.  Arthur Siegfried: Why did you go there?  William Siegfried: I used to go swimming there.  Arthur Siegfried: Do you remember the Municipal Harbor in Atlantic Highlands?  William Siegfried: Just about remember that.  Arthur Siegfried: How about the river in Highlands did you go swimming there?  William Siegfried: Yes, I used to go there.  Flora Higgins: Pretty strong current. Do you remember swimming against that strong current?  William Siegfried: Yes.  Arthur Siegfried: Do you remember Gertrude Ederly?  William Siegfried: Sure. I remember the name.  Arthur Siegfried: Who was she?  William Siegfried: She was a famous athlete swimmer.   Arthur Siegfried: Where was she from?  William Siegfried: I don't remember.  Arthur Siegfried: Did she live around here?  William Siegfried: Down at the shore somewhere. My mother used to talk about her.  Arthur Siegfried: Do you remember when the Queen of England came to Red Bank and Sandy Hook?  William Siegfried: No.  Arthur Siegfried: My mother used to talk about getting "dressed for the queen," and I never knew what she meant until I saw stories of the queen visiting here in 1939. She came into Red Bank train station and they went through Rumson and out to Sandy Hook.  William Siegfried: Strange, I don't remember that.  Flora Higgins: Do you remember when the Hindenbergh blew up?  William Siegfried: I remember that.  Flora Higgins: How did you hear about that? Did you hear about it on the radio?  Arthur Siegfried: Do you remember the Morro Castle?  William Siegfried: Yes.  Arthur Siegfried: How do you remember that?  William Siegfried: Only announcements over the radio. I was home: that's the only thing I can remember.  Arthur Siegfried: During the Second World War, do you remember anything about the bombings with airplanes? How about submarines off New Jersey Coast?  William Siegfried: I knew of them, but I've forgotten them.  Arthur Siegfried: Were you ever involved in anything like the Civil Air Patrol or spotting for planes?  William Siegfried: No.  Arthur Siegfried: Do you recall the Lindbergh baby kidnapping?  William Siegfried: All I know is what I read in the paper.  Arthur Siegfried:  How about Mr. Wilentz who prosecuted that? David Wilentz from the law firm in Perth Amboy. Did you ever know him?  William Siegfried: I know him, sure. I met him personally.  Arthur Siegfried: Have you gone to your Lions Club meetings lately?  William Siegfried: It's about three or four months since I've been to a meeting.  Arthur Siegfried: Why don't you go to the meetings anymore?  William Siegfried: My friend who used to come here to pick me up and bring me home passed away, so I have no driver.  Arthur Siegfried: But you went to the Lions Club for many, many years, right? And you were in the Masons many years ago, and you haven't been to a meeting in a couple years.   A humorous poem written by Mr. Siegfried about aging (click to enlarge) William Siegfried: My chauffeur passed away.  Arthur Siegfried: Do you remember years ago somebody asked you if you went to the doctor and you said, "No, I didn't go to my doctor," and they said, "Why not?" Remember what you said? "The doctor died so I stopped going to him."   Flora Higgins: Well, I'm sure people are always asking you, you are 104: how come you are so youthful and healthy and alert and over 100 years old? Do you have any reasons for that? You're a very hard worker, I can see that.  William Siegfried: I really don't know.  Flora Higgins: Well, congratulations to you anyway, and thank you for sharing your memories with us. It's been a pleasure.   William Siegfried: Thanks for coming.  Flora Higgins: And thanks to you too, Mr. Arthur Siegfried, for helping us and facilitating.  
MonmouthCounty;William Kresge;1920;2000;William Kresge, 1920, 2000        Remembering The 20th Century: An Oral History of Monmouth County    Date of Interview: March 7, 2000  Name of Interviewer(s): Rhoda Newman and Kevin Chambers  Premises of Interview: Mr. Kresge's home, Ocean Grove, NJ  Birthdate of Subject: June 3, 1920    Ms. Newman: Mr. Kresge, tell us how you first came to Ocean Grove.    Mr. Kresge: My father, Homer D. Kresge, was with The New York Times, working on the mid-week pictorials and the rotogravure sections. He decided that he would like to have his own newspaper and looked along the Jersey coast as he thought the shore would be good for his wife and five children, and in 1925 he purchased The Ocean Grove Times, moving there from their home in Cranford.    Ms. Newman: What were your first impressions as a child?    Mr. Kresge: My first impression was as a five-year-old boy, and I can't remember that too well. But I do remember having a wonderful childhood  it was a good place for children, excellent place for a family. I can begin with the fact that Ocean Grove was a small community at that time, because in the winter there were probably only twenty-five hundred people. Of course in the summer, we had up to forty thousand or more. They say even as high as fifty thousand, but I don't know about that.    Mr. Chambers: Where did you go to elementary school?    Mr. Kresge: I went to the Ocean Grove Elementary School, Neptune High School, and Bucknell University, graduating in 1941, when I joined the Navy flight program. But going back to childhood impressions, I recall when all of the town's streets were dirt. Water wagons would sprinkle to control the dust and the children in bathing suits would follow and enjoy the spray.     Ms. Newman: Do you remember when the streets were paved?    Mr. Kresge: The concrete streets, which came first, were Main and Ocean Avenues, and they were paved by the Fred McDowell Company, Neptune, in the winter of 1930. My father and others used to joke that these were the only roads in New Jersey that weren't paved with graft. The kids used to chew the tar used in the expansion strips and I remember putting it in my pocket, which my mother later cut out to sew in a new pocket. I had a rash on my leg which I thought came from the tar, but it turned out to be scarlet fever. I was then in the sixth grade, and I was kept out of school for a long spell. We were quarantined, and my brother and sisters were out of the house, staying with friends. Another memory was walking to the South End beach during the summer, carrying my lunch in a paper bag, and bathing in front of a family friend, lifeguard, and Newark teacher, Otto Stoll.    Mr. Chambers: Where in Ocean Grove did you live at the time?    Mr. Kresge: At first we lived at 134 Main Avenue, next door to Arthur Seger and his family. He owned a well-known sporting goods store in Asbury Park and became a founding partner of the Casino Amusement Company, which installed and operated the boardwalk rides and miniature golf.    Ms. Newman: Were you as a child or a teenager involved in your father's newspapers?    Mr. Kresge: As a child I was always involved because I couldn't get a nickel or dime to go to a movie unless I went down and swept the office first. You know how it was in those years, you had to have chores, things to do, because they didn't give allowances  that was unheard of. Everybody had to work for a little bit of money, whatever.     Mr. Chambers: Now that was in the old Times building.    Mr. Kresge: The first Times building was at 48 Main. And you know there's a little coffee shop in that part on the right  that was our office. In the back was part of the printing plant and on the second floor was the other part of the printing plant. The front part on the left towards East was the Woolston real estate agency. But in the thirties, my father purchased the building at 64 Main that was the Times building until it was sold to Dr. Dale Whilden, a dentist.    Ms. Newman: How did the town change?    Mr. Kresge: How did the town change? It was more of a resort community, centered on the Camp Meeting Association's summer programs and activities, designed for recreation, spirituality, culture, and health. The major part of the community included seasonal hotels, guest houses, and cottages. As for year-round residents, many were commuters to the better paying jobs in North Jersey and New York City.    Mr. Chambers: By train, up to New York.    Mr. Kresge: Yes. Train to New York or Newark.    Ms. Newman: You worked at the newspaper and then you went into the Navy?    Mr. Kresge: I was a fighter pilot in the Navy, I was based on carriers. I had one interesting experience when I was in the Pacific on a carrier, I landed on USS Wasp, and I was down in the ready room getting a cup of coffee, and somebody comes up, slaps me in the back, "Bill Kresge, what are you doing here?" And it was Jimmy Ferris from Ocean Grove who was chaplain of the Wasp.     Ms. Newman: Did you see action?    Mr. Kresge: I've got to say no. I was a basic flight instructor, then taught instrumental flying, and then served on patrol duty in the Atlantic, and then I was part of a night attack carrier air group for the invasion of Japan when the war ended. By the time I got in the Pacific that was over and the Japanese were pretty well subdued.    Ms. Newman: At that point did you take over working with your father?    Mr. Kresge: Yes, I worked with him. He said, "I'm not going to take any less money, Bill, whatever you get you'll have to earn." My older brother had turned down the offer and so I said I would try it. I didn't know, I was thinking about maybe going to law school, but I got involved because I had a wife and child. I had married Alice Haines. Her father and mother owned the Majestic Hotel.    Ms. Newman: What year was that?    Mr. Kresge: Well, we were married in 1942. We met in the summer, 1941, and then I went in the service and then Pearl Harbor came, so after I finished Pensacola, I came back here and we were married.    Mr. Chambers: Did you meet her in Ocean Grove?    Mr. Kresge: Oh, yes.    Mr. Chambers: Do you remember where?    Mr. Kresge: Yes, coming out of the Ocean Grove Auditorium. See, I was an usher at the time, and coming out of the auditorium walking up Ocean Pathway, I saw this attractive girl walking down the sidewalk. I needed a date for the usher's banquet, but more than that, I'd been looking at her for quite a while, you know what I mean. And so I was determined right then and there to go over and introduce myself. We became acquainted, and that was it.     Mr. Chambers: Did she go to the banquet with you?    Mr. Kresge: Yes.    Mr. Chambers: Now, what were the banquets like?    Mr. Kresge: Well, they were nice dressy social affairs for all age groups, the young ushers with their dates and the older ushers with their wives.    Ms. Newman: Where were they held?    Mr. Kresge: They were held at the North End hotel in the dining room. They were nice affairs.    Ms. Newman: For people who aren't familiar with Ocean Grove, could you describe the Auditorium?    Mr. Kresge: Well, it's the great auditorium, but we didn't call it that in those days. It's a wonderful structure, I'd say the only one of its kind dedicated to religion and culture in the United States of America. And that's what I would say. I used to say that it is the powerhouse of Ocean Grove, because without that powerhouse we would be Bradley Beach, Farmingdale, or any other place. It is the powerhouse, it is the focal point, it is the central point, it is what makes Ocean Grove distinct from any other community. And when I say the auditorium, I mean the program, the religious and the cultural. I wouldn't know how to describe it any better than that.    Ms. Newman: It is a wooden structure? The present building was built in 1894, right?    Mr. Kresge: The only changes are some rehabilitation, and maybe the addition of a sprinkler system, and the improvement of the power supply so they can use it for TV and so on. But that was done, and you've got to give credit for these improvements to Dr. George Fly Stoll. He's been a wonderful leader as far as the rehabilitation of Ocean Grove.    Ms. Newman: To get back to meeting your wife, her family owned what?    Mr. Kresge: They owned the Majestic Hotel, from about 1922 or 1923 until 1972, something around there. And by the way, I built this house we're in in 1947. Bought the land, this was Camp Meeting association land. I paid seven hundred dollars for the corner lot and five hundred dollars for the next lot. So I paid twelve hundred dollars to the Camp Meeting association for this land. And then I started building the house. I've lived here ever since. I added a wing and central air conditioning.     Ms. Newman: So when you joined the paper, what were the kinds of news stories that you covered in those days?    Mr. Kresge: Well, basically we covered the news stories of Ocean Grove and Neptune, plus family news, births, weddings, anniversaries, education, and obituaries. Today there is a difference because I don't know whether it's the papers that made the difference, or if it was the people who made the difference. Our paper would have in there practically a recording of when a person was born, his tenth birthday party, when he went to college, when they come home for vacations, the whole thing for everybody in the community. It was a community paper. People brought the news into the office.     Ms. Newman: Did the war have a great impact on the community with the men being called away?    Mr. Kresge: No. The war itself had no impact on Ocean Grove in the sense of experiencing it. They blacked out the boardwalk, things like that, but I don't think it had any impact. But the post war period had an impact to this extent that Ocean Grove had busy, crowded summers in the forties and fifties and into the early sixties. This was before lower air fares and cruises and vacationers expanded their horizons. In those years, the town was crowded with people. Today the town is crowded with cars and there's a marked difference.    Mr. Chambers: I take there were a lot of people who used to come down on the train from the Northern cities.    Mr. Kresge: Of course people came and they didn't need their car. Somebody would bring them, or they'd come in busses, trains, you know. If they did drive, they'd probably leave the car parked the whole time. Until they had to take it outside the Ocean Grove gates from midnight Saturday to midnight Sunday. The reason my house is here is because we like to go out Saturday night. There were parking lots, nearby.     Ms. Newman: Could you talk about that a little bit more?    Mr. Kresge: Now you're talking about the gates, and that was a long stretch. That took a number of years from about 1975 to 1980 or 1981, something like that. The courts finally dissolved Ocean Grove as we knew it.    Ms. Newman: How was it as you knew it?    Mr. Kresge: As we knew it, it was lovely. The only problem was, as you say, the parking of automobiles, but it was always pretty much a walking community anyway. I walked to go over to the auditorium to usher in the summer and to St. Paul's Church in the winter. I didn't mind. It's healthy and the town is designed, really, to be a walking community. In those days, you had amusements, theaters, and everything in Asbury Park, and that was all within walking distance.    Ms. Newman: When you and your wife were dating, did you stay within the community or did you walk over to Asbury Park?    Mr. Kresge: Oh, when we'd go out, we'd go all over the shore. We were part of the whole shore community.    Mr. Chambers: Did you ever go dancing in the casino?    Mr. Kresge: Yes, I did, but that was for big name bands. In the 1930s we used to go see Sammy Kaye down in Point Pleasant, too. But back in the thirties other big name bands came here.    Mr. Chambers: Did you hear Fred Waring?    Mr. Kresge: In Ocean Grove, you mean? Oh, yes, several times.    Ms. Newman: So the Auditorium was used for concerts.    Mr. Kresge: The Auditorium has always been used for concerts, a popular platform for leading operas and other things. A cultural haven.    Mr. Chambers: Now are there any big time names that you remember in particular?    Mr. Kresge: Well, I heard Marion Anderson, back before the war. That's probably one of the earliest concerts I heard. And then I probably heard Caruso and those people, but you know I don't remember. I probably did, my mother and father enjoyed music. And then I remember Lowell Thomas, and I remember they used to have movies in the Ocean Grove Auditorium years ago.    Ms. Newman: Any other speakers other than Lowell Thomas that you remember having seen? Or famous preachers?    Mr. Kresge: Oh, yes, sure, I heard them all. We had Billy Graham a couple of times. When Billy Graham was here we were so overcrowded it overflowed into the Young People's Temple, and that was filled too. And they had it wired for amplification. And then we had conventions here. And the biggest convention, which came probably about three times, maybe four, was the Church of the Brethren. And the Church of the Brethren would bring oh, about ten thousand people in June. The hotel people loved it, everybody loved it. And they were good. They started the helper program where they sent cows with the kids to take them to help European farmers during post-war reconstruction.  And then the Presbyterian Women were here for a convention in the fifties. And the Quakers, of the Religious Society of Friends, of which my wife is a member by the way. And they were here, too, in the fifties. Maybe sixties, I don't know. But they were good years. Giovanni Martinelli came. They used to say he was as good as Caruso.  Lawrence Tibbett, another Metropolitan tenor came.    Ms. Newman: Earlier in the twentieth century, a member of ? spoke at the Great Auditorium, and the last presidential appearance here was when Richard Nixon came in 1970. Can you describe that?    Mr. Kresge: President Nixon came in April of 1970. I remember going down to get as close as we could to the helicopter that landed on the Ocean Pathway.    Ms. Newman: Your paper, of course, covered the appearance.    Mr. Kresge: Sure, oh, sure. We covered that, but every paper around covered it. I used to have a notebook containing nationwide press clippings of President Al Kinley's speech in the Ocean Grove Auditorium, but it's gone. Something happened to it when I sold The Times. Things kind of disappeared, but that's beside the point. President Nixon's visit was also covered nationwide. But it was a political time, the others weren't as political, but this was a political adventure that was arranged by the Republican Party. And they were going to hold it some other place, but they didn't think it'd be large enough, and so Freeholder Harry Larrison of Ocean Grove helped them arrange for the Ocean Grove Auditorium. But Ocean Grove itself wasn't involved from a political aspect. So they could have the auditorium, but the event was sponsored by the Monmouth County Republican Party.    Ms. Newman: Did people throng into town to see the President?    Mr. Kresge: Yes. A lot of people came, too, when Woody Allen was here.     Ms. Newman: Woody Allen made a film?    Mr. Kresge: Yes. He made a film here. It was called Stardust Memories. And the auditorium was converted to the Stardust Hotel, and I remember printing special stationary for the Stardust Hotel and all kinds of things for the film. We also had quite a printing business, we used to print for all over the area. But that's all secondary. We're talking about Ocean Grove now.    Ms. Newman: We were talking about the change coming when the gates were opened on Sundays. Was there controversy at the time?    Mr. Kresge: At the beginning of the proposal to open the gates, yes. But as we were worn down as to patience, we could see it was a losing cause. And so the controversy dwindled down. But there was controversy at the beginning. "Nobody's going to drive in here." Some residents would lie down on the street, you know, that kind of thing. Yes, it was controversy at the beginning. It all began when the Ocean Grove Police, which never enforced traffic violations on South Main Street in the history of Ocean Grove, decided to enforce one and arrested a drunken driver. And the driver was drunk as anything, we all know that, but he got off when the courts negated Ocean Grove police power. And that's the beginning of the end. The beginning could have been earlier when a newspaper delivery truck was challenged for distribution after midnight Saturday. But his case was settled, he could deliver until two a.m. and everybody was happy, until the other case came. Opening to Sunday traffic really raised real estate values because it brought in outside investors who felt Ocean Grove properties were cheap. They converted many single family homes into apartments. I don't believe many of those apartments could pass a legality test today. Sometimes I look in a house that had been a private home, and see there are six apartments in it. But you know these things happened in that period. Zoning regulations were lax during governmental transfer to Neptune Township.    Ms. Newman: Did the quality of life change for the old time residents?    Mr. Kresge: No, I don't think the quality of life changed.    (Mrs. Kresge comes in)    Ms. Newman: We are curious about your courtship.    Mrs. Kresge: You remember that far back? Fifty-eight years, or was it just yesterday?    Ms. Newman: Sounds like a happy time.    Mrs. Kresge: Well, so far. I think we're going to make it now.    Ms. Newman: We were just talking about what happened when the chains came down. You were saying the quality of life didn't change either.    Mr. Kresge: No, the only thing is you miss certain features, but that had nothing to do with the change. The deterioration of Asbury Park had nothing to do with the change in Ocean Grove. The quality of life hasn't changed in Ocean Grove, I don't think.    Mr. Chambers: Now with different personalities that were in the community, were there any people who were unique or stood out more than others, anyone who was famous that actually lived here that you remember? Anybody who was really interesting that lived in the community?    Mr. Kresge: Howard Smith was one. I used to call him the "Scattergood Baines." Baines was a hardware merchant in the Saturday Evening Post stories. And Howard was everybody's friend.    Mr. Chambers: So was his son.    Mrs. Kresge: Young Howard. I call him Young Howard.    Mr. Kresge: I remember one of Fiopo, the heavyweight boxer trainers. When he lived on Heck Avenue, he used to give us instruction to try to get us kids in shape.    Mr. Chambers: Did he live in that small cottage with that unusual roof?    Mr. Kresge: Yes. That's where he lived. Every New Year's Day, he'd go into the ocean. I've read about the Polar Bear Club, but back then we just all called him the crazy guy in the Grove, I guess.    Mr. Chambers: Now this area seemed to have been like a boxing haven. There were a lot of boxers who lived in this general area. Was there a reason they used to practice in the Monmouth County area?    Mr. Kresge: You know where Monmouth College is? Max Bear's manager lived in the summer at the corner of Cedar and Norwood there, on the right.    Ms. Newman: Did they actually train there?    Mr. Kresge: No, they trained in Asbury Park, in an open air ring. They would give so much money to anyone who could stay in the ring.    Mr. Chambers: There was a boxing ring in Asbury Park?    Mr. Kresge: Yes, there was. But it was only temporary. It was only used as a training site.    Mr. Chambers: Did you ever go over and see it?    Mr. Kresge: Oh, yes, we used to watch them train. And then Tony Galento, in later years. Young fellows like to see that. Anyway, with Bear, I remember Claude Newburry, the coach in Neptune, was a pretty well known fellow, and he went in the ring with Bear, but he didn't last a round. He didn't make his money. They were sparring, you know. And then I remember more about Asbury. I remember the dance marathons.    Mr. Chambers: Was that in the old casino building?    Mr. Kresge: No, that building is gone that had the marathon in it. It was between First and Second, between Kingsley and Ocean Avenue there someplace. Red Skelton was there. That's how he got started, dance marathons.    Mr. Chambers: There used to be gas pumps in front of Howard's house.    Mr. Kresge: Yes, they were there. Remember the gas shortage? About twenty years ago during the gas shortage, we used to get up at four, five in the morning and go over and get in a long line for gas at Shafto's Garage at Corliss and South Main Street. The line went all around onto Railroad Avenue, now Memorial Drive.     Ms. Newman: That would be 1972, 1973.    Mr. Kresge: Yes.    Ms. Newman: Ocean Grove was founded in 1869. Were there still some of the old timers, the original settlers, what you call the pioneers of Ocean Grove around when you came in the twenties?    Mr. Kresge: There probably were, but as a boy I didn't recognize them.    Mr. Chambers: Do you remember any different types of stores that were up on Main Avenue?    Mr. Kresge: There was the drug store that used to be Steven Woolley drug store, and next to that was Frank Morris photographic place. Frank did all the developing.  Frank had a route to Seaside and back, or something, and people working for him all night doing film up here in Main Avenue. That's a new building there now. Then next would be Downy Flake Doughnuts. Do you remember them? The machine would be in the window, and the doughnuts would come out. They made them right in front of you. We kids used to think that was great. Then you came to Angles and Smith, hardware, plumbing, heating, and tinsmith.    Ms. Newman: Were there many restaurants in the town?    Mr. Kresge: Year 'round, no. You could hardly keep a restaurant going in the winter.  But in those days you had the oceanfront in the summer, and there were restaurants. I'm just going to talk about restaurants. Hotels had dining rooms, too. There were numerous cafeterias -- Majestic, West Lake, Sampler Inn, Grand Atlantic, Marine, and the Osborne. And as for the restaurants, you had the Wisteria, the Homestead, Barnegat Bay, and others.     Mr. Chambers: Did you eat at most of them?    Mr. Kresge: No, we resided here and rarely ate out.    Ms. Newman: Those were mostly for tourists?    Mr. Kresge: Yes. Maybe now and then we would go out to eat, but in our younger days there were five kids, my mother and father, and you wouldn't go out to eat much.    Mr. Chambers: Do you remember anything about the Depression years here in Ocean Grove?    Mr. Kresge: The Depression years were actually happy years for kids. We didn't know any better. Everybody was poor, you know, but we didn't even realize we were poor. But I think the conservative nature came from those years. I can't believe kids today, getting the money to spend. Just can't believe it. People in our generation said, "You take your lunch to work or school." Today they spend five or ten bucks everyday going to lunch. You took a brown bag with a rubber band around it. And maybe a nickel to buy the milk. I remember kids used to say if you got ten cents you could have a big Coke today. A big Coke, a ten-cent Coke, was a rare thing.    Mr. Chambers: What kinds of activities did you do in the wintertime?    Mr. Kresge: In the winter, we boys played basketball. One place was behind the auditorium between the tents.  Eddie Holl used to shoot there. His father was a cop, and they helped putting baskets there. And another place we played (you know we only had one basket) was right over here on Stockton across the street. There was also a basket at the Taylor Dairy.    Mr. Chambers: Taylor Dairy, was that in Ocean Grove?    Mr. Kresge: Yes, Taylor Dairy bottling plant was on South Main Street through to Lawrence Avenue.     Mr. Chambers: What about ice-skating?    Mr. Kresge: Yes, we ice skated on Fletcher Lake, and the fireman would spread water right on the ice at night for a glossy surface the next day. You didn't have the pollution that you have today. When I say pollution, I don't mean the real foul pollution, but I mean you have paved roads today, and the oil, itself a pollution, comes off the roads and so we don't have as much ice as we used to have. And even when you get cold weather, you don't necessarily get safe ice. So that's one of my theories, and I might be all wet on that. But we used to have more ice. We played basketball, we roller skated a lot, and we used to have roller skating hockey on Ocean Avenue at Ocean Pathway. It was concrete there, and of course we didn't have the traffic in the winter. We had our goals at the two streets that come up to Ocean Avenue there. We used to wear out roller skates in those days. Of course all summer you had the beach, and after World War II, we formed the Ocean Grove Recreation Commission. We thought that the kids needed something for activity, so we developed a playground on Inskip Avenue. It was used quite a bit. We hired a schoolteacher for summer supervision at a five hundred dollar salary. He came to me, and I remember him saying to the commission, "You're wasting your money, you can't get many kids over here, they're all at the beach." So here you have a playground that's vacant in the summer. And that's the same thing would happen today if you had one. Now I'm not talking about tiny tots, we had tiny tots too, we had a seesaw and that kind of stuff, but I'm talking about the place where you play softball and that type of thing.    Mr. Chambers: Were the police strict with kids when you were younger?    Mr. Kresge: I don't think we had a problem. They were strict in the sense that you couldn't ride your bike on Sunday, now that would be strict for a kid. If that's what you mean by being strict, yes they were strict. And there used to be one cop called McGill, and all the kids called him Fatty McGill, and he was a bicycle cop. He used to go around town on a bike.    Mr. Chambers: When you went to the beach in the summertime, did you have a locker that your family would keep for the summer?    Mr. Kresge: Yes. But I don't think I needed anything when I was going down as a kid.    Mr. Chambers: You would just dress at home and walk to the beach?    Mr. Kresge: Yes.    Ms. Newman: But the girls didn't walk in the street with their bathing suits on, did they?    Mr. Kresge: Little kids could, but not girls who were women, no.    Ms. Newman: Where would they change?    Mr. Kresge: Where their relatives had them over. You had to have a cover up. That didn't change until twenty years ago, maybe thirty.    Mr. Chambers: Do you remember a swimming pool at the South End at all?    Mr. Kresge: No, I don't. I never knew there was one.     Ms. Newman: But there had been one at the North End.    Mr. Kresge: Oh, the North End, yes. The Recreation Commission used to sponsor a swimming meet there every year.    Mr. Chambers: Did you participate in that?    Mr. Kresge: As kids, we used to go to the pool  we'd walk up to the beach from the South End, get up on the roof of the North End bathhouses, and dive into the pool so we didn't have to pay the ten cents or whatever it was. The gate man was right there looking the other way, so we'd get on the roof over here and jump in. That's what the boys did  the girls paid.    Mr. Chambers: Did you play any of the games at the North End, I know they had skeeball.    Mr. Kresge: Oh, yes. Everybody played skeeball. They had a shooting gallery, and bowling alleys. There was Ann Louise Candy, and a couple of restaurants, but that was there on the ocean side. They had a concert area on the pavilion where people would go and rock. Jenkinson had the North End and South End candy stores.    Mr. Chambers: One of the people up at the North End was an artist named Zad, did your family ever have any pictures done by Zad?    Mr. Kresge: Everybody had their picture done by Zad. In fact, our son has one that Zad did. I think his sketch cost three dollars. He was good, too.    Mr. Chambers: I'm always looking for them, at flea markets.    Mr. Kresge: I think almost every family that's ever been to Ocean Grove has one. The North End boardwalk also had a post office substation. There was also Kohr's Frozen Custard there. There was the Saratoga Root beer stand: all you could drink for ten cents. And big old Barnegat Bay Restaurant was there. People used to come down from the city and have lunch. It was an excursion restaurant. In other words, you could bring your sandwiches and things, and then buy sodas there, or ice cream, and they had a pavilion of tables. But that was more an excursion type of thing, not a restaurant. Anyway, going back to the post office substation. Billy Wegge, who is now a judge in Missouri, told me his job as a clerk at the substation at Ocean Grove was the best job he had ever in his life.    Mrs. Kresge: They used to have walkways from the North End hotel over to the pavilion and dining room. The walkways were also lobbies where guests sat to watch people go by.     Mr. Chambers: Now the pavilion was upstairs. Did you ever go to anything upstairs? What kind of programs were upstairs?    Mr. Kresge: The dining room was upstairs. The dining room of the North End. And they had a lot of affairs there.    Mrs. Kresge: And the swan boats on Wesley Lake were lovely.    Mr. Kresge: The had pedal boats too, on Wesley Lake.    Mr. Chambers: Did the ushers also have any of their functions at the North End?    Mrs. Kresge: That was the highlight of the social season.    Mr. Kresge: People used to line up to watch them come up to the entrance and see the girls, what they wore and all.    Mr. Chambers: They used to have a program put on by the ushers  it was called the "The Womanless Marriage." Can you tell us a little about that?    Mr. Kresge: They did it twice I think. It was all part of the auditorium ushers show, and they did that for years, and there'd be different themes.    Mr. Chambers: It must have been a riot.    Mr. Kresge: It was, you'd get a big crowd. You'd have ushers band, too, and all the ushers were in the show. Some were better than others. But mostly everybody came just for the laughs. But they had all kinds of skits. The North Gallery had their skit, the South Gallery had their skit, too.    Mr. Chambers: It was almost like a competition among the different sections of the auditorium ushers.    Mr. Kresge: Yes. The platform ushers. The ushers from different sections of the auditorium would have skits.    Mrs. Kresge: They used to have a man coming around in Ocean Grove in a truck, selling vegetables and things like that. I don't remember, did they have fish, Bill?    Mr. Kresge: No, I don't remember fish. They had fish market down on Olin Street there.    Mrs. Kresge: Where the little antique shop is now.    Mr. Kresge: Behind where the post office is now.    Mr. Chambers: Lenora Smith's father, W.C. Parker,  ran that. Fred Smith's wife's father.    Mr. Kresge: Yes, Parker. And he built a house right up here on Stockton Avenue.    Mr. Chambers: Right on the corner.    Ms. Newman: What about Mrs. Wagner's pies? Was she around?    Mr. Kresge: It was probably there when I was a kid, but I don't know much about Wagner's pies. The neighbors purchased it. You know there were a lot of bakeries around. On Main Avenue where the delicatessen area is, they had their ovens under the sidewalk.    Ms. Newman: So you went across to Asbury Park regularly.    Mr. Kresge: Oh, yes. We were kind of sister towns.    Mr. Chambers: Did you go to the North End movie theater?    Mr. Kresge: Oh, yes. The big thing about the North End's Strand Theater was the matinee. The ladies came from around the shore. There was the bus line right in town, so this is the reason why I say that there were more people than cars. But, they had belt lines  they were light busses. Ocean Grove Beltline's last trip of the evening would be after the eleven o'clock show at the Strand Theater. It would take people back to Ocean Grove. People used to ride the belt line for a nickel. It would drive all around Ocean Grove, and get to the North End Hotel eventually. That was still going after the war. But before there were two routes, two busses going, A route and B route. They both would go to the oceanfront, but one would go to that part of town and the other this part of town.    Ms. Newman: Sounds like very happy memories.    Mr. Kresge: There are people around who remember the belt line, sure. You'll find out when you talk to other people.    Ms. Newman: When again did the North End Hotel come down?    Mr. Kresge: Can't remember the year. Let me think.    Mr. Chambers: The first North End Hotel burned. Were you around? It was the first fire.    Mr. Kresge: That was in the 1920s wasn't it? Yes. Well, there were two or three fires at the North End. The biggest fire of course was in December, 1977 right on Ocean Pathway. The Majestic and the Pathway Manor, the Ardmore burned, and then the Dun Haven. They all went  it was quite a fire. We didn't know it, we were sleeping!    Mr. Chambers: Do you have any mementos from the hotel?    Mr. Kresge: Not major, but we do have photos and things.    Mr. Chambers: Ms. Hurry has a piece of the Hindenburg. Now do you remember that?    Mr. Kresge: Yes, but not too well. I remember running down later, but the point is I wasn't there when it exploded and burned.    Mr. Chambers: Do you remember the Morro Castle?    Mr. Kresge: Yes. I remember that. That was about 1934. Richard Gibbons was the young editor at The Ocean Grove Times at the time, and he reported the fire in a New York City newspaper in a front page story with a byline. I don't know which one it was off hand, but he can tell you more about it. He was at The Times at the time, then he went to The Asbury Park Press.    Mr. Chambers: Did you walk down the next morning to see when it was still smoking?    Mr. Kresge: Oh, yes.    Mr. Chambers: And what were the crowds like?    Mr. Kresge: Tremendous.    Mr. Chambers: Even that morning?    Mr. Kresge: Oh, yes.    Mrs. Kresge: It was like a ghost. Of course we didn't have television, but we did have radio, and it had been announced that the ship had exploded. Oh, it really was a mob scene.    Mr. Kresge: I gave a Morro Castle postcard to the museum, and the artist for that postcard was a friend of Marsha and Chuck Kendron. He didn't know it until he saw it in the reserve and he said, "I know him."    Mr. Chambers: I know that it became somewhat of a big tourist attraction.    Mr. Kresge: It was for a couple of years. It was there a while.     Ms. Newman: Looking back on your time here, thinking about all of your accomplishments, is there anything that you feel you have not yet accomplished that you would still like to see accomplished? Or that you would still like to see happen in Ocean Grove?    Mrs. Kresge: Yes, I'd like to see something happen up there where the North End Hotel was.    Mr. Kresge: Yes, I'd like to see a parking lot. To me it's worth more than the million that it'd cost. If you think all the cars are bad now, what are you going to do with all of these Ford motors that they are turning out every year?    Mrs. Kresge: Try to encourage having a life-care center here. Harrogate is down around Lakewood, and is to me, the nicest. But they would be equally as nice there. I think there were plans, but it wasn't encouraged at all.    Mr. Chambers: I think that's why they took the North End Hotel down preparing for that full-care facility and then it never happened.    Mrs. Kresge: But it would have been nice. And it wouldn't have a lot of children that you would have to support as far as schooling is concerned. We've got enough in Neptune.    Mr. Kresge: Well, it was ahead of its time. But now, my goodness, they're putting up a dime a dozen. They're all over the place. The Meridian, which is Jersey Shore Medical Center, is putting up one someplace. But anyway the North End Hotel is shut up and gone.    Mr. Chambers: I guess it's the same with the South End pavilion.     Mr. Kresge: I think the storms took that pretty much.     Ms. Kresge: They used to have things out on the pier.    Mr. Kresge: I used to be a locker boy down on the East Side of the boardwalk, down at the South End, when I was a kid.    Mr. Chambers: They still had a small section of the old bathing lockers west off the boardwalk, but that was finally taken down.    Mr. Kresge: That was because it was condemned by the Township of Neptune. That's what did it. You know we probably couldn't build that tent colony today. You couldn't do it. Now what's wrong with a summer Tent Colony, another one wouldn't hurt, more of them wouldn't hurt. What's wrong with it? But the point is that your zoning would say no.    Ms. Newman: It does make more of a unique character.    Mr. Kresge: That's what they say and if you left it to Township, they would have had them all gone.     Ms. Newman: We've seen progress in some ways and lack of progress in other ways.    Mr. Kresge: I remember when the tent cottages didn't even have private baths, they had the facilities in the center. It was better than an outhouse  it was a sewered building and it had showers. It was in the center of the block.    Mrs. Kresge: People really loved the tent-cottages. We tried it one year  ugh!    Mr. Kresge: We didn't care for it. But we have a home here.    Mrs. Kresge: But they do fix them up.    Mr. Kresge: Everybody's fixed them up, yes.    Ms. Newman: Thank you for this very interesting interview about Ocean Grove during the twentieth century.    Mr. Kresge: You are welcome.      
MonmouthCounty;Wenner and Schultz;1911;1999;Wenner and Schultz, 1911, 1999          Remembering The 20th Century: An Oral History of Monmouth County    Date of Interview: July 27, 1999  Name of Interviewer: Flora Higgins  Premises of Interview: Ocean Grove  Birth date(s) of subject(s):  Richard Wenner: August 3,                                                      Benjamin Schultz: March 9, 1911     Ms. Higgins: Mr. Schultz, you've had a lifetime involvement in pharmacy, and one of the highlights of that lifetime, is your efforts at poison control. Would you tell us a little bit about that effort?    Mr. Schultz: It started in 1952 outside the New York City Health Department. It came to the awareness of the pharmaceutical profession that children would die in great numbers. It was a sickness that started right after World War II. It was due to the sweetening of aspirin tablets, baby aspirin.  St. Joseph's put it out.  More children died from baby aspirin than diphtheria, scarlet fever, measles, whooping cough, and polio combined.  I worked with Dr. Morton Rodman, who was the Professor of Pharmacology at Rutgers University, and we developed a chart in category form of the toxic ingredients in household chemicals, such as furniture polish, cleaning fluids, Clorox -- all the things that people use for household things. And in those days, the toxic ingredients didn't have to be put on the label, so where did you get information? So, this is the project of Dr. Rodman and myself. We put it in categories. We could identify about 100,000 chemicals around the home.  Believe it or not, but each one has a different brand name. I remember a baby who swallowed Parker's Fountain Pen Ink.  They called up the emergency room.  We extended these Poison Control Centers to the Jersey Shore Medical Center.  At that time, it was called Fitkin Hospital.  Also, we extended them to Monmouth Memorial Hospital, Monmouth Medical Center, and there was another hospital, Riverview Hospital, what they call Riverview Medical Center today.  We sent an old index card file with all the different items to the emergency rooms, because there were not computers in those days. And if it wasn't on the index file, I would get calls in the middle of the night and the morning. I remember eating supper at home, and Robin or my other daughter, Leona, would say, "Daddy they want you in the hospital." I knew what it was. They wanted to know what the toxic ingredient in certain chemicals involved. Well, I had my master list.  I would tell them sometimes you could pump the stomach or you could give an enema.  With some substances you couldn't give an enema, because the fumes, like the petroleum products, all those fumes, that included the cleaning fluids, would get into the lungs, and they would cause low bile pneumonia and, of course, the patients would pass away, not from the toxic substances but from the fumes. So, we had to teach them how to use things with the tube and wash out the stomach and all that other stuff, that goes with it.    Ms. Higgins: Did you get any help from the county government?    Mr. Schultz: No. It wasn't around in those days. We did it all independently and it emanated from us.  At that time, we had the blessings from the Monmouth County Medical Society and the Monmouth County Society of Pharmacists.  I was the key coordinator and I had the burden, but it was a labor of love. I'll tell you one little incident. It happened with little Joey who was two years old in Long Branch, NJ.  His mother was pregnant again, and she was taking prenatal capsules once a day as ordered by the doctor. And all of a sudden, she looked at the bottle, and  it was half-empty. Little Joey had swallowed a lot of prenatal capsules, which contain iron. Iron is very toxic to a young child. We didn't have an antidote for iron, once it was in the blood. We didn't have the chelating agent. There was a Dr. Press from Belmar, NJ, a pediatrician who went to the University of Chicago Medical School, and he had developed a formula, which given intravenously, drip by drip, would be an adjoining agent and take out all the excess iron from the blood. I called Dr. Press. I said, "Give us the formula fast. I have a child who is in a coma!"  We did it, and six days later the hospital called me and said, "Little Joey is out of the coma," and I still get a thrill down my back when I hear it -- "Little Joey is out of the coma!"  Little Joey now is about fifty-five years old, walking the streets.  But we in Monmouth County started poison control with the three hospitals. There wasn't any other place in the United States.  All the fifty states have poison control now.  Now we have a center open 24-hours a day at Saint Barnabus Hospital in Newark for the entire state. Most drug stores today have that 800 poison control number, and it is opened 24- hours a day with a pharmacist and a physician in charge.    Ms. Higgins: Do they get a lot of calls with people who were unaware of what's going on regarding medication or something related to that?    Mr. Schultz: Overdose and drug regimen, yes, that also is included now.    Ms. Higgins: So it's narcotics as well.    Mr. Schultz: Anything that has to do with the cause of death of any human being.    Ms. Higgins: Who takes these calls?     Mr. Schultz: There is either a pharmacist who answers the phone, or a physician.  Sometimes they have to have a combination. Of course, they also have to tell the hospital how to treat the patient, whether they give an emetic or drain the stomach out, you know, a stomach tube and all this other stuff of washing the stomach out.  And, of course, some medications are depressants, and the patient must have a stimulant to keep him or her alive.  That is the whole process with the poison control. And now it is in all fifty states. In Arizona, we have trouble with poisonous snakes. We don't have any in New Jersey (laughs...)    Ms. Higgins: So you can make calls about poisonous snake bites?    Mr. Schultz: Anything that would cause the death of an individual.    Ms. Higgins: When you go to school to be a pharmacist, do you learn all this?    Mr. Schultz: We take a course called toxicology.  I graduated from the College of Pharmacy in 1931, and that was sixty-eight years ago.  We took two years of toxicology, because most of the drugs and medications were poisonous. You're talking about arsenic, elixir quinine and strychnine. Strychnine is poisonous. And a lot of the herbal remedies that are used today were all the official drugs. There were very few chemicals in the pharmacopoeia in those days. Today, they use them as alternative medicine.    Ms. Higgins: What is your opinion of St. John's Wort, for example?    Mr. Schultz: What do I think? How do they market it? I'll tell you how. They say because it is a nutritious substance, it is not under the jurisdiction of the Food and Drug Administration.  So, you take the medicine, mix it with prescription medicine and you could die. One hundred thousand people have died from drug related accidents.  Another way to say it is experimentation. Also with some prescription drugs there was a lot of drug interaction.    Ms. Higgins: Of course, there are even some foods that cause harmful drug interaction.     Mr. Schultz: Yes.    Ms. Higgins: Are you a pharmacist, Mr. Wenner?      Mr. Schultz: No, he was in drug rehabilitation. This also was developed in Monmouth County before it went nationwide.    Ms. Higgins: Has Monmouth County over the past century been aggressive with narcotics rehabilitation? How did you get that established?    Mr. Schultz: I had my first discourse with Joe Irwin in 1966 or 1969.  The Monmouth Board established an interim drug committee, and I was on that committee, to advise the Board on the promotion, development, establishment and coordination of unified programs for the prevention, diagnosis, treatment, rehabilitation, and control of drug addiction.    Ms. Higgins: How did you know there were drugs in the county? Mr. Irwin once said there was no problem.  He was from Middletown wasn't he?    Mr. Schultz: He changed his mind. I think he also had a boat business or something.    Ms. Higgins: I remember Mr. McCarthy was the chief of the Middletown Police. And he also affirmed there were no drugs in Middletown.      Mr. Schultz:  I taught thirty police departments in Monmouth County, and we had them combined.  I gave them lectures on the controlled drugs. The federal laws came out about controlled drugs that were addicting and all this other stuff. I had to teach thirty-five police departments.  I taught the police.  They didn't know about drug raids. This was new to them.    Ms. Higgins: You mean information about controlled substances like marijuana and cocaine.    Mr. Schultz: You got that right. Cocaine is legal. It is still legal, unlike illegal marijuana or heroin.  The Federal Narcotic Act came into effect in 1910. It had the narcotic laws.  Then later on, Hubert Humphrey, who, by the way, was a pharmacist besides being Vice President and a senator from Minnesota, and Durham, who was a congressman from North Carolina, created the Humphrey-Durham act, which clarified two classes of drugs in the United States. One for which you had to get a prescription and the other that you can buy over-the-counter with the proper labeling. Until then, there was no control over the drug traffic, I mean the patented medicine market. Lydia Pinkham Tonic is an example.    Ms. Higgins: I remember buying Elixir of Terpinhydrate and codeine right over-the-counter.    Mr. Schultz: That was official to sign for it always. Before it became Elixir Terpinhydrate and Codeine, it was Elixir Terpinhydrate and Heroin.    Ms. Higgins: Really?    Mr. Schultz: That's right. And in those days, they found out that heroin was more addicting than any of those narcotics.  It is part of the opium group, you understand? So, codeine you could control and you had to sign for Elixir Terpinhydrate and codeine. And pharmacists could not sell more than a bottle of those types of cough medicines to any one person within a certain time frame.  Then, later on, we got drugs that weren't addicting, like dexamorphon, as they called it then, that eliminated some of the problems. But we had addicts that used to go from one drug store to the other buying Elixir of Terpinhydrate and Codeine.    Ms. Higgins: How about the phase of cleaning fluid highs in the 1950s?      Mr. Schultz:   Kids used to get high on the vapors, the solvent of the cleaning things. And if it's in a closed area, you can asphyxiate yourself. They used to put a hood over their heads and they thought they'd get the euphoric effect they wanted. They got it all right. Some were lucky and some were not. Then they used to put a big plastic bag over their head. We tried to educate the public, and this effort stemmed from me and the Monmouth County Pharmaceutical Society working with the Monmouth County Board that later on became known as the Monmouth County Board of Alcohol and Drug Abuse Services.    Mr. Wenner: The Monmouth County Board that established the Interim Drug Committee on October 18, 1966. So that is the official original date that you can document the beginning of a public effort in the county, outside the pharmaceutical association, which was known as the MOPS, the Monmouth Ocean Pharmaceutical Society.    Mr. Schultz: That's right. It was a bi-county organization.    Mr. Wenner: Two counties combined. They were the leaders at that time in the education about controlled drugs and drug abuse.    Ms. Higgins: The pharmacists. They were seeing the results of drug abuse.    Mr. Wenner: Exactly, in their drug stores.  They got to know first hand working with the police because the police and pharmacists worked together. They got to see the problem spreading, so they really could take credit, along with narcotics officers, for giving this the attention it deserved. Then after four years of working with the police department, as Mr. Schultz said, other pharmacists and professionals, through the Monmouth Ocean Pharmaceutical Society and the Police Departments that wanted to cooperate, on September 1, 1970, the Board of Chosen Freeholders appointed a permanent committee of residents to further the work of narcotics control and treatment to be known as the Monmouth County Narcotics Council. Now for the record, I am just going through the types of people who were important.  The members appointed were: George Bartell, who was a Monmouth Medical Center Hospital Official  Eleanor Luhrs, who was a citizen, but she happened to be a nurse  Edwin P. Gage, who was a real estate executive  Earl B. Garrison, who was the County Superintendent of Schools and a former high school principal  Benjamin Schultz, a pharmacist  Thomas Totural, a school principal at the high school level  William P. Gannon, a business man  Dr. Rose C. Thomas, a professor  Robert N. Goger, a drug abuse worker  Robert Ansell, Esq., an attorney from Asbury Park  Robert S. Newman, a probation officer  Dr. Sandra Wolman, another professor in the human sciences  Robert Benham, an executive  Norma Kline, a Brookdale College administrator  Dr. Sid Leventhal, a psychiatrist  Frank Espolota from law enforcement.  Benjamin Schultz was elected by this group as the first chairman of the Narcotics Council in 1970.  I want to say this group comprised a wide range of citizens from various fields, which I think is the reason for the success they had.  It included a lot of people with a lot of good minds.    Ms. Higgins: Was it one of the first times that a private sector had worked with the political body?    Mr. Schultz: Yes, in that field.    Mr. Wenner: Yes. There is a history of that. The history would be the nursing field, where Geraldine Thompson started, on her own, a private nursing organization.  Later, they had to go public for the funding, because they didn't have enough nurses.    Mr. Schultz: This was the first organized attempt between the citizens of the county and the officials of the county.  They created a structured attempt among physicians, pharmacists, nurses and schools to provide education, both for prevention and treatment and all the other things.  Funding could be channeled and be responsible, because the Board itself monitored all the grant money given them: Federal money, state money, and the county money all went to the Monmouth County Board of Drug Abuse Service.    Ms. Higgins: Would you say that proportionately there is less drug use in 1999 in Monmouth County than in 1970, or was there less in 1970?    Mr. Schultz: Well, I can't answer that because I have been out of the statistical field, but I will say this, we forgot one little aspect, the social drugs that were never on the list. For instance cigarettes.  Tobacco supporters are still talking from -- what do the Indians say?  "Talking with forked tongue, from both sides of the mouth."  But you have to look at the other side of the coin. We need money for social programs. Stop kidding ourselves. The cigarette industry is a lot of money.  Prohibition was repealed back in the Roosevelt days. We regulated the alcohol industry. You don't hear too much about it, and they still talk about their limitations. Alcohol is one of the biggest social drugs. That is another social drug we are talking about. Nicotine and alcohol. What other things? How many cups of coffee do you drink a day?  There are drug interactions involved. These are exempted because they tax the dickens out of it, and they needed extra money to fund the social programs. So what do you do, you want to kill the golden goose that feeds the different organizations? And then you've got to walk a tight line.     Ms. Higgins: So now alcohol is included in the Monmouth County Board of Drug Abuse Service?    Mr. Schultz: Oh yes.    Mr. Wenner: Yes, that came later. Let's just go back. The members of the Board of Chosen Freeholders at the time of the 1970 establishment were Joseph C. Irwin, Director, and Axel Carlson.  Harry Larrison, Jr., of Ocean Grove was a member of the Board. Albert Allen of Aberdeen Township, and Ernest Kavalek of Middletown completed the then five-member Board of Freeholders, who saw the wisdom of appointing this group. The interesting thing that occurred was that, due to the professional experience and other widespread experience that they were willing to appoint to this counsel, within five months, this group headed by Mr. Schultz convinced the board that they should hire a staff to work on this. I want to say for the record, this was a record time. This was a very conservative county at the time, with a very conservative group of Freeholders.  They didn't spend money freely. For them to come up with a full-time paid individual within five months shows their faith in the group that they appointed, and they were buying what the group was saying, that there was a problem, and they met it very quickly. So we can't be critical. We may be critical for the early stages of being closed to the situation, but they certainly adapted very quickly, and it within five months funded a staff and a full budget for the group.    Ms. Higgins: Which has worked without interruption to this day, 1999.    Mr. Wenner: That's correct. Until today. In 1977, the Freeholders changed the name of the group to the Monmouth County Board of Drug Abuse Services, which it still is today. In 1984, the Freeholders created the Citizen's Advisory Committee for Alcoholism Services. So some seven years later, they began to include alcoholism in the overall work of that group. Finally, the two groups were merged in 1988 to create the Monmouth County Board of Alcohol and Drug Abuse Services.  Mr. Schultz was very instrumental in the pressure on the Freeholders.  He was the chairman, but he was also the most outspoken in terms of the need.  The others did not have the background in the street, nor in the pharmacy, of seeing the results, firsthand along with the police department. So, he had the best vantage point and took the lead.  They all supported him and it was funded in 1970.    Ms. Higgins: During all this time, you continued to work as a pharmacist?    Mr. Schultz: Making a living.    Ms. Higgins: That's quite a heritage to leave now that you have gone to Arizona to do good things.  You have created poison control first of all, and then the narcotics and drug awareness programs.    Mr. Schultz: And they still continue today.      Richard Wenner, 1971  Mr. Wenner: There is one thing that Mr. Schultz left out. Back in the early days, which I got to know as the first director of the Narcotics Council in 1971, and that is the early days of the poison control, the pharmacist used puppets and cartoons to educate young children very effectively. We incorporated that into the work of the Narcotics Counsel and we had a great deal of success because right away we were able to reach young children. It is one thing to turn the older kids and stop them from using or get them into rehab. It is another thing to prevent the core group that is coming up from starting, and this group did that very effectively with the cartoons and puppets.    Ms. Higgins: I think I may be sitting with the gentleman who helped me quit smoking.  In the 1960s, my daughters were in the Highlands Public School, and they were shown a lot of these kinds of things about damage from cigarette smoke. The girls came home and begged and begged me to stop smoking. It was finally easier to quit smoking than listen to the children anymore, and I thank you for it. That was very effective.    Mr. Wenner: I can tell you, I was there at the Highlands Public School. I can give you the names of all the people. The mayor was a pharmacist by the way. This was  Richard A. Stryker, who had a pharmacy in Atlantic Highlands.  But he was at the school. He kicked off that program at the Highlands School because I was there representing, and we got those articles, including nonsmoking, into the school at that time, in that year.  Jim White was Mayor of Highlands.  Richard A. Stryker was a MOPS, who had worked under Ben. Even though he went forward with this group, he still had his Monmouth Ocean Pharmaceutical Society Group, and Stryker was the regional man in Atlantic Highlands, which is how he got us in the schools, and Jim Snynder was there too, as well as Buddy Bahrs.  These were the famous people who were there to kick off the Highlands and Atlantic Highlands Initiative.  They were both local officials.      Ms. Higgins: Mr. Schultz, tell us something about Highlands and clam digging.    Mr. Schultz: Well, I never dug clams, but I used to go crabbing in the Pleasure Bay and get crabs.    Ms. Higgins: And you could eat them then? For a long time you couldn't.    Mr. Schultz: Yes.  We used to get the crabs in Pleasure Bay and get a whole bag full, and then we'd get a big pot to boil them in. We'd boil them until  we'd see a red color. I said, "Now we can eat the crabs."  We had to boil them.  I wouldn't want to eat a raw crab or even a clam. Steamed ones I'll eat, but I won't eat a clam the way the waters are.    Mr. Wenner: There have only been four administrators over a twenty-eight-year period, and there is no other organization in the county that has had that continuity of administration. There was myself in 1971-77  Gregory C. Ulrich, who is deceased, 1977-86  Charles D. Brown in 1986-88  and Barry Johnson from 1986 to the present. So, there is a great deal of stability in a board that had had only four administrators in twenty-eight years.    Ms. Higgins: You mentioned something of the educational work that the Board does. What if you're confronted with some teenagers who have a drug problem or who have been arrested for dealing?  Is that also within the jurisdiction of the Board?    Mr. Schultz: Now for instance, the changing structure of a family life. We need two salaries in order to support a family. This is both part of the Board too. I think it was Ocean Township High School that got the first grant. School lets out at 3:00 pm and there's nobody home to supervise. So, we funded supervision at the Ocean Township High School from 3:00 to 6:00 pm. The teachers would get paid by the Board, which would give funds to the Board of Education budget. It had nothing to do with the school budget. We funded them to supervise the children.  They had to be in the auditorium or someplace where they could do their homework or something else, while being supervised by a teacher, who was paid for the three hours by the Board.    Ms. Higgins: Good prevention there.    Mr. Schultz: The idea was prevention. We looked at the picture. You have a lot of churches here and synagogues and God knows, whatever.    Ms. Higgins: Is there anything further you would like to say about the poison control project?    Mr. Schultz: The State Poison Control Project is now coordinated at St. Barnabus Hospital, and all the hospitals know that if there is any overdose or any poison emergency to call St. Barnabus.  Senior Citizens now have a lot of drug related problems due to drug interactions.    Ms. Higgins: So you have moved from identifying poisons to identifying these interactions you see, because a lot of people are on a lot of medications?    Mr. Schultz: Drug intervention, yes.  I took a survey of the lifestyle habits of senior citizens, which was published in 1983 in the New Jersey Journal of Pharmacy.  How many smoked cigarettes, how many had a drink, or drank, the listing of the so-called social drugs, and also the medications. But, we formed another thing. We call it Project SPIRIT.  I got a group of retired and semi-retired pharmacists together. It's an acronym for Senior Pharmacists in Retirement in Transition.  Our target was senior citizens, who take more medications than the rest of the population. Aging is not a disease, but you can develop diabetes, heart trouble, asthma, bronchitis, and many other things. We had the first brown bag program in the United States. They used to bring their pills in a bag and come to the Senior Citizen complexes where we had six or seven pharmacists, who asked the people, "How do you take this and how do you take that? This is eighteen years old. Do you take this anymore? No? Why don't you throw it away?  Drugs deteriorate."  So, we had to educate the seniors. You can't play around with drugs.  It's just like in today's newspaper with the front page: A woman took one of these nutrition things that's for sleeping or something like that.  It caused her death. And now they are going to have an autopsy. But they pinpoint her because three or four people have the same drug. This is the trouble with our laws. Congress passes laws, but they're not complete. Little by little, we are adding on to the problems, and we've got a society that likes to experiment.    Ms. Higgins: You think people take too many pills?    Mr. Schultz: Some do, yes.    Ms. Higgins: I worked in a pharmacy. I was convinced that everyone in America was constipated.     Mr. Schultz: Senior citizens, especially.    Ms. Higgins: Well it was really quite an experience.    Mr. Schultz: That is because of their style of life.  They sit in a rocking chair all day long, they don't walk. We don't expect them to run 100 yards and do aerobic dancing, come on. You can't take the pace. But, you can do it within your limitations.     Ms. Higgins: Would you tell me something about the War years here in the county?    Mr. Schultz: It was a question of my younger brother going into the Army or me. Of course, we had to enroll in the draft and at that time, my younger brother wasn't married yet, and I was married. I got married in 1937, and if they closed my drug store, there would be no drug store in all the borough. There was no drug store in Deal or Oakhurst, and there was no drug store in Elberon, either.  What are you going to do when you needed a prescription? Then we had after hours. See now, we have a little sign in some of the drug stores about after hours pharmacies.  I started that too.  We work with the Police Departments. In case somebody needed an emergency prescription, they would call the local police department, which would have their numbers.  They would come and open their store, but the cop would come at the same time. Why? We had fellows with maybe a small gun but it looked like a cannon when they used to shove it in your belly. That happened once or twice. So not only do you call us, you want a cop there when the prescription is filled and make sure everything is okay. That was part of the after hour prescription plan, which was endorsed by the Monmouth County Board of Alcohol and Drug abuse. It was teamwork by everyone.    Ms. Higgins: Did you get down to the seashore much?    Mr. Schultz: I lived at the seashore in Deal.  We have a beach casino, one of the biggest along the coast.    Ms. Higgins: It's not gambling?    Mr. Schultz: No, we just called it Deal Beach Casino. I think it's four blocks long, and then the Phillips Avenue Beach, the big end, is free. The back you had to pay for. The lockers, and all, and the pool. We had an oversized pool, bigger than an Olympic pool, and this daughter of mine learned how to swim there.     Ms. Higgins: You were too busy with the Pharmaceutical Society?    Mr. Schultz: No, I did go too, but I found out years ago that I couldn't take the sun. I was so sensitive. When I married, we went on our honeymoon to Miami. We took a dose of Miami Beach. We went into the hotel and I signed up. We got on the beach and I got a big umbrella. I was about a half an hour on the beach. I get back into the hotel room, and I swelled up like a balloon. So, we called, and asked for the Miami, Florida doctor who came and looked. He said, "You've got sun poisoning." I said, "But I wasn't in direct sun."  He said, "You are very sensitive to the sun."  From then on, I was never a sun worshipper. They could get tanned, and browned and green and yellow, but I couldn't.    Ms. Higgins: But what about sun shield?      Mr. Schultz: They didn't have those.  I got to a point where I said, "What do I want to play around for?"    Ms. Higgins: You know, actually, you have a very youthful look to you. I wouldn't be surprised if keeping out of the sun is a part of that.    Mr. Schultz: I see people my age and don't push it.    Ms. Higgins: I see people twenty years younger than you who look older.    Mr. Schultz: And they are all wrinkled and everything else. It is all caused by the sun. You see people who worked outdoors, and it's the elements.     Ms. Higgins: Tell me about Project SPIRIT again.  What is the acronym?     Mr. Schultz: SPIRIT: Senior Pharmacists In Retirement In Transition.  We used to go to Senior Citizen clubs, nutrition centers and the high rise apartments, the HUD senior housing, where they take disabled people because of the federal requirement  90% were senior citizens.  So, we took all that and we did our programs all over the county: Belmar, Middletown,  etc.  They had six or seven of those senior complexes.  They brown bagged all the stuff. I worked with Boy Scouts, too.    Ms. Higgins: What do you mean, "Brown Bag?"     Mr. Schultz: They took all the medications  they took over-the-counter, nonprescription and prescription drugs, and brought them down to us,  and then we would ask them, "How did the doctor tell you to take this?  Did they tell you to take it before meals? After meals? What foods are you to avoid?  Do you know about the drug and food interaction?"  We taught them medication planning.     Ms. Higgins: So, you could look at a person's bag of pills and make recommendations?    Mr. Schultz: And some of them were very outdated.  They had big bags.    Ms. Higgins: And you knew right away what they were?    Mr. Schultz: Oh yes, and if they were outdated, anything that was filled two years and you hadn't had it refilled you'd throw it away, because that could be a problem.    Ms. Higgins: That certainly is a consciousness raising program.     Mr. Schultz: And it is still going on today in the United States and more and more pharmaceutical groups are doing it.  The Dean from the University of Arizona College of Pharmacy said the figure of drug-related accidents amounts to $76 billion dollars a year. That means a fall, breaking a leg, it all started with the drug that was mistakenly taken.  So we have to educate the public now. This is a new role, not roll pills or capsules. That is the scene of pharmacy today.    Ms. Higgins: Please tell us about the File for Life.  Is there anything like that in Monmouth County?       Benjamin Schultz with Middletown Police Explorers, 1988  Mr. Schultz: The File of Life is like the Vial for Life that I did with the American Red Cross. The fact sheet is the same. The principle is also the same. The fact sheet contains emergency information about you for anyone who has to enter your home.  It contains information about your doctor, the medications you take, the nearest relative, your medical condition, health insurances, advance directives, health care, power of attorney, and living wills.    Ms. Higgins: Who keeps this file? Is it at the Police Department or at a hospital?      Benjamin Schultz (seated middle) instructing seniors about medication  Mr. Schultz: No, it hasn't reached that yet.  You have to ask for a new fact sheet in case the status changes,  because over time you may develop a new disease, angina  for instance.  Well, the File of Life is good for everybody, but we are directing it towards seniors now. Aging is not a disease, but it invites disease. Over time, you get new diseases and new medications and taking the old medications with it. Some of them take seventeen, eighteen, twenty pills a day. They don't know how to manage their medication, that is when you get your overdoses and so forth and so on.  It is a long process, and Steve Gross, who is the Dean of the Pharmacy in Long Island University, explains it.  100,000 die from drug-related causes, and we spend $76.6 billion dollars a year.  What is our role now?  Drugs are starting to treat diseases you never could think of.  When I got married in 1937 and wanted to take out insurance, the life span of an individual was only fifty-five years. Today, a baby born will live to be in the middle seventies, and the women used to outlive us by eight years, but in those days the women didn't smoke, or drink, or take some of the other social drugs. But now they are going to be executives in our economy. Chief executive officers of big companies are women, and so they have to have the three martini lunch.    Ms. Higgins: That is another thing about drugs. You can beware of drug reactions, but if you take a beer, that could throw everything into an uproar.    Mr. Schultz: I'd hate to give you the list of alcoholic beverages that react with medications. But everybody says, "Well, one drink ain't going to hurt."  You take a sleeping pill and take a nap. I'd hate to tell you how many actors and actresses forgot to wake up the next morning.  You know as well as I know, you have a big list. That is part of my play that I rewrote.    Ms. Higgins: Your play?    Mr. Schultz: It's In The Cards, and they are doing it today, but I can't be in two places at one time, or I would have been there watching them. It is a twenty minute play.  There is a pharmacist there who talks about the medication with alcohol and with some of the other things.    Ms. Higgins: So, it is educational as well as entertaining.    Mr. Schultz: Very much so.    Ms. Higgins: Where is your play being played today?    Mr. Schultz: In Howell Township. I can give you a place.    Ms. Higgins:  What are some of your more significant memories of the County? Has it changed much?     Mr. Schultz: In Ocean Grove proper, I've never seen so much building done in the summer time, and rebuilding. Every week. Not across the street here but every little block, there are two or three. To me, Ocean Grove is a fire trap  just one big thing and the whole city would come down, but at least they've got prevention. But they are building up.  We took a ride to see Asbury Park, which was the key city when I first came down here during the Depression.  Cookman Avenue was a busy drive. There were no malls. There were no other things that changed the shopping habits for people. They all came into Asbury Park to shop at stores like Steinbachs.  Today, they are all empty buildings.  We took a ride down to Steinbachs.  If you shot a cannon, nobody would even bother you. Where else did we go?  Ocean Avenue Boardwalk.  It used to be a lot of what we have in Bradley Beach and Belmar. The little shops, you know, but they were all gone. All the rides are gone.      Ms. Higgins: We went down there in the 1950s with the children and it was a lot of fun.     Mr. Schultz: Miniature golf, they used to have the Susie van come down, you know play on the top of the one side.    Ms. Higgins: Have you taken a trip to Red Bank?    Mr. Schultz: Red Bank, yes.  I used to go to Red Bank all the time.  The little businesses add a personal touch. You went to a Red Bank Store, they new every customer by his name.    Ms. Higgins: Probably knew his prescriptions by heart, too?    Mr. Schultz: I knew, and I would tell them, and I would counsel them at the same time. But I was maybe a little different. We did a lot of compounding in those days. We had a drug store in Allenhurst.  Mayor Hague of Jersey City came down there.    Ms. Higgins: Mayor Hague?    Mr. Schultz: Sure, he had a home on Deal Esplanade.    Ms. Higgins: Some of the presidents used to come here too.    Mr. Schultz: Right after the Civil War. Now, Long Branch was going down and Asbury Park was taking all of the business.    Ms. Higgins: Do you see Long Branch picking up?    Mr. Schultz: Very much so and Hilton just started. They built a Promenade instead of the wooden boards and it goes a mile and a half until it gets to the public beach.  It's lovely. They fixed it so it won't wash away, at least the Promenade won't.  The Army engineers are going fourteen miles out, dig up sand, and put it on the beach here. I remember when Ocean Grove on Sundays had a big chain that went right across the entrance road.  You couldn't ride, you had to walk.  And all the cars would be out on Main Street, and in all of Asbury Park.  In  Deal you have the Guggenheims, the Salemans, the Lehmans. Heck, Monmouth College was sold for taxes.  Annie, the movie, was filmed at Monmouth College. There was also a girls school, a finishing school there, and I went there, and I got all their business. When I first walked in there, I hate to tell you, faucets were made out of gold, not brass, gold fixtures.  They had a swimming pool downstairs.    Ms. Higgins: A lot of wealthy people would come here.      Benjamin Schultz (left) with his brother, Carl Schultz, in front of their drug store, 1936  Mr. Schultz: Very wealthy. When I first came in the 1930s and I had my drug store -- well, it wasn't so little in those days, it was big.  Today, a drug store is a mini-mart  some even handle milk and cheese and things.  They played polo in Deal.  Lehman from that little square behind.. real horses, a real polo field.  Later on, they played it out in the west portion of the county.    Ms. Higgins: They play it in Colts Neck now.    Mr. Schultz: But I am talking about when I first came down in the 1930s.  They all played polo.  Lehman Avenue and North Avenue was a big polo field, it was three blocks square, and they played polo for fun.    Ms. Higgins: How would they get down here?    Mr. Schultz: On Monmouth Road, they had horse stables.    Ms. Higgins: That is certainly a different flavor.    Mr. Schultz: And even on Roosevelt Avenue, we had one horse stable that went all the way back to the brook.  Where the veterinary hospital is today, there used to be a horse stable.  and on West Down Heister, there was a horse stable, too.  The so-called class played polo and a lot of them moved out to the end of the county, to Colts Neck and other places.  I'll give you an example. The Leads, who had Manhattan Shirt Company, bought a stretch during the War.  You're talking about the War years. They wanted to live in a certain style. They bought Middlebrook. There were no Middlebrook apartments  it was a farm.  They incorporated the farm, they grew vegetables. They had servants and everything else needed in a big house.  The corporation paid all the help.    Ms. Higgins: They probably got farm assistance, too?    Mr. Schultz: Sure, being a farm, you get the pre-tax. There are ways of circumventing, no matter who was legislating.    Ms. Higgins: My first interview was a farmer who was trying to tell me all about how some people would use this to make more money.    Mr. Schultz: You take Shore Dairy with a Pollack.  He had show dogs.  He was a dairy farmer.  Because of his connections, all the milk that he got was sold to all the hospitals.  Now, there is Monmouth Memorial Hospital Board.  There was another little hospital called East Hazlet Hospital. But, all the milk and all the business and the puppies and, of course in those days they delivered milk to your door. Today they don't do it.     Ms. Higgins: I can remember when we lived in Middletown, they delivered milk and eggs, and the Dugan Coffee Cakes would come.    Mr. Schultz: That's right to the door. I used to get a fellow from Lakewood. He would make his route to all the good people in Deal.  We had a chicken farm. They brought fresh eggs from the farm. You'd get two dozen this week, a dozen this week, according to how you ate the eggs.  Don't want to eat too many eggs with the yolk in it with the cholesterol.  That was before Welsh Farms. Then we stopped.  Borden, Sheffield, used to deliver milk too. They don't deliver anymore, but Welsh Farms still does it.    Ms. Higgins: Mr. Schultz, as we approach the end of the century, what would you like to say about Monmouth County History?      Mr. Schultz: People are getting older. Our population is growing older. It used to be only 9 percent or 10 percent.  The fact is that the population is growing older  I think Federal legislation has to help older people.  An active man should be allowed to work without anyone penalizing him if he took his Social Security at age sixty.  You have to permit them to work until age seventy.  You may have to increase the retirement age to seventy or sixty-five.  It is happening now, federal legislation, but step by step. You can't do it all at once or you disrupt the entire country.  Grow old gracefully, and maintain a quality life. Sure, I got high blood pressure, I had it for forty years. I didn't get it over-night, but I still walk.  Walk all the time.  My daughter takes me down to Belmar to the Arcade to play kids games that used to be in the Asbury Park Boardwalk.  They pulled out the carousel.  The family structure is changing too. I see if you want to buy your own home, and that's the idea, it can't be done by a one-income family.  They both work. Now you have to find out how you establish day care.  It is already here. They both work. They both come home and pick up the kids. The husband no longer sits at home and says, "You've got to do the dishes."  It is a two way street. Give and take in life, and that is how it should be.    Ms. Higgins: Is there anything else you'd like to say?  I have enjoyed talking with you so very much!    Mr. Schultz: There are so many things in this head of mine. What do I say? Charles Brown was the first director of the Monmouth County Board of Alcohol and Drug Abuse, but then the county health board needed a new administrator  because he could handle money, he is now director of the Monmouth County Mental Health Board.    Ms. Higgins: How about some final comments on the cooperation between county and state government and private organizations? You were apparently a pioneer in that. Did you find Monmouth County pretty progressive along those lines?    Mr. Schultz: The federal government realized we were condemning cigarettes way far back.  So now, they still can't put the cigarette industry out of business. All they said to the federal government was, "Cut us down in the United States, but give us a free hand globally.  The Muslims must smoke a lot of tobacco. Europeans all smoke cigarettes. Let us have that market."  They all like American cigarettes, the combination of Turkish and domestic, and the same thing goes with cigars. They exempted cigars.  Cigars are just as habit forming and just as dangerous as cigarettes  the coal tar goes into your lungs and causes cancer. It's a new ballgame, and they will have to experiment like we did. I lived through maybe eight decades.  I saw a whole century of change from the radio in the early days to the TV set.  We thought TV movies would go out of business, but they are still making money. They adapt movies for TV.  And the same thing goes with computers. Mr. Microsoft, smart Gates has got the control because he has control of all the software, not the computer itself.  They had the antitrust act in existence since the railroad days.  They had to put some minor changes to it so no one individual has control, so there is competition. With competition you have no problem.    Ms. Higgins: Well, I am hearing a message from you that we should encourage competition, which this country seems to do.    Mr. Schultz: And they tried.  Don't kill the small guy.    Ms. Higgins: Your comments about encouraging people to work longer are thought-provoking, also.    Mr. Schultz: Have a retirement age, and at least don't penalize them because they are growing older.    Ms. Higgins: I am so glad to have to talked with you. I really am. Thank you very much for contributing to our archive.  
MonmouthCounty;Warren Booth;1929;2000;Warren Booth, 1929, 2000        Remembering The 20th Century: An Oral History of Monmouth County      Warren Booth and his wife, Sonya  Date of Interview: July 21, 2000  Name of Ms. West: June West  Premises of Interview: 2 Cornell Avenue, Neptune, NJ  Birth date of subject: November 12, 1929    Ms. West: Good morning Mr. Booth. Thank you for giving us this interview. Please tell us a little bit about your early history, please.    Mr. Booth: I was the second son of Eugenia and Russell Booth. I had two brothers and a cousin who was also raised by my parents. We lived in Red Bank, New Jersey. Right after the Depression, we were taught many skills and different things by our parents. My mother was very, very keen on us all becoming educated. During our early childhood, we all showed an interest in sports. On the high school level, we all played basketball and other sports. All of us received scholarships to college, and all of us graduated from college.    Ms. West: You were educated in Red Bank, New Jersey?    Mr. Booth: Yes, in Red Bank, New Jersey. My older brother went to Howard University, I was at West Virginia State, my brother Russell went to Syracuse, and my baby brother went to Dartmouth. We all completed school and came back to various areas to live.    Ms. West: Could you tell us something about your childhood in Red Bank?    Mr. Booth: There are several people who were very key in the Red Bank area. They were key people to me. One was Dr. Parker, Sr. He was an idol to me and to mostly everyone else in Red Bank.    Ms. West: Why was this?    Mr. Booth: Well, not only did he give me birth, but his views and opinions were so tremendous. I used to go home at night and go over whatever he would say to me. Sometimes I would go to visit him after school and just talk to him, to hear his views. He was a very intelligent man.    Ms. West: So he had a profound interest in youngsters and in your life?    Mr. Booth: Yes. He gave a lot of information to me and to my brothers. He was also instrumental in telling all youngsters that they needed an education. I was so happy that I was able to share his life. After completing high school, I went to West Virginia College and then came back to this area, not knowing just what I wanted to do. So I went to work doing various kinds of things. When the opportunity came about teaching, I applied for a job at Red Bank Regional High School.    Ms. West: And what year was that?    Mr. Booth: In 1957, I think it was. And then I also started coaching track. An opening came in basketball, so I applied to be the head coach in basketball at Red Bank Regional High School. I received that job, and I coached for fifteen years there. I coached  the track team for twenty-some years also. During that time, I had the pleasure to send many a youngster to college on scholarships. As of now, they come back and the feedback is tremendous. I have a tremendous feeling to see and hear from them.    Ms. West: So what locations in Monmouth County will have a personal significance to you?    Mr. Booth: All of them in this county.    Ms. West: And why is that?    Mr. Booth: Because I could see how it goes. When I was a youngster coming up, there were very few vocations that a person could choose from. Most of the areas here in Monmouth County were farm areas, and that was the main type of vocation for people in this area. We had one or two factories that you could work in. But to see how things just grew from the land is unbelievable.    Ms. West: So did you travel extensively throughout the county?    Mr. Booth: Yes. I have traveled over most of the county. I adore some parts of it. Some parts where the farmlands were are not farmlands anymore. But I can still look back and identify them. Red Bank also had a very, very important thing that I was proud to be a part of. They used to have a professional baseball field in Red Bank. We used to see all the professional Negro teams play here. We used to see House of Davids, Satchell Paige, Josh Gibson, and just the gamut of all the players. They had night baseball there, also. As youngsters, we used to play there.    Ms. West: This is a field that just Negro teams played on?    Mr. Booth: No, all teams played on it. But I did have the privilege of seeing some of the great Negro teams play there.    Ms. West: And that's in Red Bank, right?        Dr. James Parker, Sr.    Mr. Booth: It was in Red Bank, but it's not there anymore. It's a housing development now. A lot of changes happened in the area. As I said, Dr. Parker was my idol. Coming up, I used to wonder why. When I was young, I didn't look at things like I do now. But I noticed that most of the people in Red Bank were either homeowners or intending to buy. You didn't have any hotels, and you didn't have any places for people to live other than a home. And I thought at first that was a bad thing. And then one day I was discussing with Dr. Parker the impact it would have on Red Bank to have other kinds of housing here. And he said we didn't need any low-income housing in Red Bank. He said if we got it, they would put it on the West Side of Red Bank.    Ms. West: Why the West Side?    Mr. Booth: Well, that's where most of the Negroes lived, on the West Side. And Dr. Parker said we didn't want that here. He said that would be when Red Bank would lose control of Red Bank. And I didn't realize what he was saying to me. I heard the words, but I didn't know what it meant. It had no impact on me. So as I grew older, I kept that in my mind. And then I watched Red Bank accept loans and grants from the government, and then they put up a low-rent project. And I saw Red Bank deteriorate.    Ms. West: And it was put up on the West Side, as Dr. Parker had said?    Mr. Booth: On the West Side. That's where they built it, so his foresight was tremendous. He knew the outcome. It was unbelievable. As I got older, my parents passed on, and I moved back into the home where I was born. And this was after this project was built. I stayed there two years, and I couldn't sleep at night with all the noise, etc. And then I knew exactly what Dr. Parker had meant. And Red Bank couldn't control it, because federal money was put into this project. And then the government controls things like that. People then lost interest in their homes. Prior to that people took pride in their homes and property. After the project you could see a decline in Red Bank. I have always said that was a tremendous decline, and I was forewarned of it by Dr. Parker. He said it would happen, and it sure did. It was a very sad situation. I moved to Tinton Falls, and stayed there for about twenty-five years. Then I moved to Neptune. When I first married, I had to live in Neptune because it was the only place where you could get an apartment. There were no other apartments. There were none in Red Bank and none anywhere else.    Ms. West: So you are saying that was the only place you could get an apartment. Could you elaborate on that, please?    Mr. Booth: We had no places for Blacks to live. There were no apartment buildings for Black people to live. I am going back into the 1950s, and there were no homes, either. We were told many times, "Why would you want a home?" or "You would have to have too much money" and all kinds of different things to discourage us from buying a home. But it was hard even to get an apartment. You had to put your name down, they had to interview you, and getting an apartment was like buying a house. But Neptune was the only place where young Blacks could rent an apartment.    Ms. West: Entertainment-wise, what did Black people do in the county? Was there anything here for them?    Mr. Booth: Oh, yes. Musically, you could always find entertainment. We used to go to the theatres, and mostly the nightclubs in Asbury. You could get entertainment if you liked music. Your theatres had entertainment as well, like Long Branch and Asbury, and sometimes in Red Bank. The Count Basie Theatre sometimes had entertainment. It used to be called the Carlton Theatre. Every so often they would give a show or would have some type of a talent.    Ms. West: Live entertainment.    Mr. Booth: Mostly the entertainment was live back then. We saw Bo Jangles. Most of the entertainers would come to this area because of the shore. And we used to see them then. We had an Armory in Asbury Park where you could go and see live entertainment. Every Friday and Saturday night, they would have somebody there singing or playing. And that's the way we received our entertainment, unless we went to New York.    Ms. West: Going back to your youth before we get too far into our conversation, what type of student were you? Did you like school or have any particular interests or favorite subjects?    Mr. Booth: I liked school, not as much as I should have as a youngster. I was a boy that loved outdoor activity. I had a boat at a young age, and I used to spend time out on the boat with my dog. I went fishing, hunting, and those kinds of things. I could have spent more time studying, as I look back now.    Ms. West: So where would you take your boat?    Mr. Booth: Oh, we would go all up and down the Navesink River. Sometimes we would go all the way down to Sea Bright on the river. And sometimes we would take it and go up all the way up to Shadow Lake up to the Pike.    Ms. West: Where was Shadow Lake?    Mr. Booth: That's the lake up in Lincroft. We used to follow the river where it meanders all around, and I had a little kayak, so I was able to pick it up and carry it. It was a little two-seater, so it made it nice. When I went to college, I left it for my brother, and he ripped it. And that was the end of the kayak.    Ms. West: So you have good memories of your youth?    Mr. Booth: Yes, I do. We had a lot of areas that we could play baseball, football, basketball, etc.    Ms. West: What were your favorite games to play?    Mr. Booth: I used to like basketball, and swimming I loved. Every summer they used to have swimming down at the boat races in Red Bank. A couple of years I won a race down there.    Ms. West: And what boat races were these? Did they have a name?    Mr. Booth: Regatta. And after the Regatta, they used to have swimming races for youngsters in the area. And it was a big thing for the kids back then.    Ms. West: Who sponsored that?    Mr. Booth: The town of Red Bank. They sponsored most of the activities back then. There was not a Parks and Recreation Department back then, but it was the borough that sponsored those activities. Now you have activities sponsored by your different clubs in Red Bank, and the YMCA sponsors a lot of activities. So the youngsters are able to get a good outlook.    Ms. West: Do you have any keepsakes or memorabilia from your youth?    Mr. Booth: No, I played on an all-star team when I was in high school. I played with some guys in college who were tremendous athletes, and I had the privilege to play with them. One of them played in the NBA and went on to become a coach of the Detroit Pistons. I had a brother who was very, very high in the eyes of people in the professional sport of basketball until the War broke out.    Ms. West: World War II?    Mr. Booth: No, the Korean War or Conflict. After that, he decided he had better raise a family and just didn't bother with it anymore.    Ms. West: Did you like to read books or anything when you were a youngster?    Mr. Booth: Yes, I did. I liked to read, believe it or not.     Ms. West: Did you have a favorite author?    Mr. Booth: Shakespeare was great. Books were precious. One book that we had to read was the Bible. We spent a lot of time reading that. I used to have to go and read to my uncle almost two or three times a week. He would insist that we do that. And he used to check us out on our reading.    Ms. West: Before the advent of television, did you have any favorite radio programs?    Mr. Booth: We only had one: we used to listen to The Lone Ranger. I think it came on three times a week, and we were only allowed to listen to it one night a week. We had to do our studies and homework, and we had chores to do. We didn't have time for too much radio. I had to go to choir practice, and things were different then. Then you had to involve yourself in different kinds of things like choir, which would take two nights a week. Then you had school activities you were involved in, like we were involved in basketball, and that would be two nights a week. Saturday night, more or less, you would spend with the family or went visiting. And Sunday was church.    Ms. West: You come from a very close-knit family with a very strong background.    Mr. Booth: Oh, yes, very close. Years ago, your mother was the ruler of the house. She was the ruler and your father was the enforcer. Our mother was five foot eleven and she could take care of each and all of us. She had a pretty good size on her, so we obeyed her.    Ms. West: Did you have any heroes or heroines?    Mr. Booth: I had the opportunity to meet Dr. Parker's wife's cousin in West Virginia. He was a doctor, and his name was Dr. Jones. He was like Dr. Parker, and he was one of the first Black professionals in Charleston, West Virginia. He was a dentist, and Dr. Parker was a doctor. I used to leave campus and go to Dr. Jones' office on Saturdays and visit and talk to him. He used to inspire me, when I was in West Virginia. He was quite a man. I spent a lot of time around older people, and I have always had that feeling for older people. I felt I could learn so much from them. Years ago, I thought that the younger people would be playing and distracting me from what was going on, but you could get knowledge and learn things from the older people. So I spent a lot of time with older people. Today, I also do.    Ms. West: I was thinking of Dr. Parker in medicine. How has the practice of medicine changed here in the county from when you were a youngster?    Mr. Booth: Dr. Parker would come out to your house years ago. I thought that was tremendous. He would be right there. Before you could get off the phone, he would be right there taking care of you. And he took care of all of Red Bank and other places, as well. But medicine has progressed, and his son is a tremendous doctor and person, as well.    Ms. West: And he is still practicing.    Mr. Booth: Yes, I enjoy talking to him. We both have an interest in jazz, and I listen to a lot of jazz.    Ms. West: Do you remember the first movie that you ever saw?    Mr. Booth: I would rather go play basketball or football. I'm still not a movie person. My children and grandchildren go to movies. But myself, I'm not a movie person. When I used to go to the movies,  the movies used to watch me. I wouldn't watch the movies. That's like television. If it's not something that has a lot of activity to it, it will watch me. I won't watch it too long.    Ms. West: Who is the first President that you remember?    Mr. Booth: Franklin D. Roosevelt.    Ms. West: What do you remember about him?    Mr. Booth: I thought he was a tremendous man.    Ms. West: And why was that?    Mr. Booth: Some of the things he did for the working class of people. WPA and different programs that he instituted.    Ms. West: And what was the WPA?    Mr. Booth: It was a work program for people who are unable to have jobs. They created jobs in Monmouth County, where there was a big work program.    Ms. West: And you remember the New Deal?    Mr. Booth: Oh, yes. I remember some of Roosevelt's speeches, especially the war speeches. He said he didn't like war, no one in his family did, and even his dog didn't like war.    Ms. West: This is World War II you are referring to?    Mr. Booth: Yes. I thought he was a very good President.    Ms. West: You say you like jazz. Did you always like jazz?    Mr. Booth: I always loved music, and my middle name is Hayes. My mother said that is because she thought I was going to be a singer because I used to holler all the time. So she said she would name me after Roland Hayes.    Ms. West: Oh, ok, now I see the significance.    Mr. Booth: But I cannot sing, I can only listen. And I listen quite a bit.    Ms. West: As a teacher in Red Bank, how long were you an educator? And did you always work in the Red Bank school system?    Mr. Booth: Always in the Red Bank school system.    Ms. West: In the high school?    Mr. Booth: Yes, always at Red Bank Regional High School. It was Red Bank High School, and then it changed over to Red Bank Regional when the three towns came together. I became the first Negro basketball coach in Monmouth County. I had quite a few experiences when that happened  so did my team and people in the area.    Ms. West: Please relate them.    Mr. Booth: There was the experience of people accepting the fact that Black people could coach as well as anybody else. On one occasion, I had the misfortune of almost having a riot at one of our games. It wasn't by our team or my players or anything, it was started by this other team calling names to our players. Our team was a mixed team, white and Black. One of the white youngsters came over to me when they called time out, and he said, "Coach, you better speak to that other coach because their team members are calling our guys some bad names. The names are such that I'm becoming mad." I did call time out, and I spoke to the coach about it. He said, "Oh, my guys would never do anything like that." And I told him the young man who told me this was not lying  he wouldn't lie about something like that. So I asked him to please speak to his team about it. We came down here to play basketball, and this isn't a name-calling contest. It went on such that it got very heated, and we were winning the game. Then the other team really became upset and started name calling worse than before, and it got out of hand. We had to call the game. It was very unfortunate, and it was the worst experience I ever had as a coach. And that was in basketball. Coaching track, I never ran into anything like that.    Ms. West: What year was that, do you recall?    Mr. Booth: About 1975.    Ms. West: Oh, that recent?    Mr. Booth: Oh yes. It was very bad. But we never had that problem coaching track, because it's more of an individual thing with running, throwing, or jumping. I think you had a better attitude when you are involved in track.    Ms. West: Yes, because you wouldn't call that a contact sport. Is that the reason?    Mr. Booth: That's one of the reasons, I think so. I was fortunate to be asked to go out to Colorado Springs to the Olympic Training Center twice, and that was another great experience. I had several youngsters who were competing on the national level, and I went out there.    Ms. West: Who picked you to go?    Mr. Booth: The Olympic Training Center.    Ms. West: But who sent you?    Mr. Booth: The school sent me after the invitation that my athlete and  I received. They had a very profitable fundraiser and they sent us out. I went out with the young lady who is now Assistant Dean of the University of Virginia.        Warren and Sonya Booth with Mr. Booth's grandchildren    Ms. West: You have never spoken of your family…your wife, your children, etc.    Mr. Booth: I have eight children.    Ms. West: Eight?    Mr. Booth: Yes, eight children, eleven grandchildren, and one great-grandchild.    Ms. West: How long have you been married?    Mr. Booth: Well, this time I have been married twelve years to my wife, Sonya. We don't have any children together, but she has children by a previous marriage, as I have. All of her children and mine have finished school, and the youngest one is going to college now. So we are very happy for that. Now we just try to spend time with the kids. We visit them and the grandkids.    Ms. West: Do any of them live locally?    Mr. Booth: We have two in this area, but they are all over the world.    Ms. West: I guess like most families, the world has become so small. Before you had one little nucleus, and that's where generations were. But not any more.    Mr. Booth: The family stayed in one place years ago.    Ms. West: What would you say is your greatest achievement in life?    Mr. Booth: I try to help others. I have always tried to help youngsters, and I have spent a lot of time with young people. During my years, I have done just about anything you could do with a youngster, like the Boy Scouts, teaching them how to play sports, and how to become better people. You always have to bring in that power of belief. And youngsters, to me, are very, very fascinating. I spend a lot of time with young people.    Ms. West: Did you ever have any hobbies?    Mr. Booth: I had several. One is that I like to collect jazz albums, records. I like to do that. That's my main hobby.    Ms. West: Who are your favorite jazz artists?    Mr. Booth: I like all your older artists, like Basie, Ellington, Sarah, and Ella.    Ms. West: So Count Basie, Sarah Vaughan, and Duke Ellington. Two hundred years from today, someone will pull this up, and we need their full names because they may not know them.    Mr. Booth: Count Basie was from Red Bank. They used to call him the Red Bank Kid. Duke Ellington. And Sarah Vaughan was from Newark. Then you had Ella Fitzgerald, and that is another favorite of mine. One of the younger ones that I like is Kenny G. I love Kenny G, he is tremendous. And I have several others.    Ms. West: What would you say is the most unusual thing about yourself?    Mr. Booth: Unusual? The ability to listen. I like to listen.    Ms. West: That is unusual, because most of us don't have that ability.    Mr. Booth: I like to listen, and that's why I like older people. I used to let them do the talking, and they used to like people to listen to them. And I am a very good listener.    Ms. West: You are a rare breed.    Mr. Booth: Young people like to talk today. So I can listen to them. I have a date with my granddaughter in a little while. I like to take her out to dinner, and I know she is going to be talking.    Ms. West: If you had to describe your life as a roadmap, how would you describe it? Smooth? Rocky? Up and down?    Mr. Booth: Well, it wasn't too smooth. I would say it was just like any other road that you would travel down. You have your ins and outs and your ups and downs. But it wasn't too smooth. But then again, when you look at it, life has been smooth. The fact that I wake up every day is the most positive thing that I know. It gives me a chance at the wonderful things that are here, so it gives me another shot at things. So I enjoy the fact that I am waking up.    Ms. West: As you look back over your life and see the things that you have accomplished, have you accomplished the things that you thought you would? Did you do what you thought you would be doing? When you were sitting down as a child and doing a little bit of dreaming, has any of that come to pass or is it completely different?    Mr. Booth: Well, I hope I never reach the point in my life where I say that I have completed everything. There still are so many things I would like to do.    Ms. West: Such as…    Mr. Booth: Help people.    Ms. West: Help them in what regard?    Mr. Booth: Help all people to get along, first of all. To help them understand and listen. Those things are so important  to love one another is important. These are the kinds of things I don't think we are experiencing in life today. I try to let most of the people I come in contact with know that, and I tell them to pass it along to anybody they know. I just hope I can continue.    Ms. West: If a youngster came to you today, or one of your grandchildren, what kind of advice would you give them?    Mr. Booth: First of all, I would tell them that you have to honor your parents and obey them. That is the first starting point. You have to believe in yourself. If you can believe in yourself and believe in God, then you can believe you can do something. I also would tell them that you have to strive for the highest point that you think you can make. The only way to do that is by studying and learning as much as possible. As you said, that's where you want to start. You can learn so much on the Internet. And we try to impress that on our children. I try to get on the Internet every day so I can learn something new. I like it. So I would tell the youngsters to learn as much as they possibly can.    Ms. West: What would you say are the milestones in your life?    Mr. Booth: That's a hard question. I don't look at life as  milestones.  I look at it as if I have never done enough, and I never can do enough. Accomplishments, I don't look at them too well. I think those are things that we all should do, things that we must do. Whatever I have that I can offer to another person, I just do it. And it's done out of my heart. And I don't look for any reward or recognition or anything. I don't think we should look for those things.    Ms. West: What important legacy would you have to leave to your family, friends, or whomever?    Mr. Booth: As I tell my family and children, spend as much time with the people you care for when they are alive, regardless of where they are. You make a point to go visit them and spend time with them. You love them, and you love everybody that you come in contact with. Love is a very important thing. It's very, very important.     Ms. West: What point of your life, if any, would you like to relive?    Mr. Booth: I feel as if I'm just starting to live right now. (laughter) So the rest of my life I would love to relive. As I said before, every day is a blessing. So I would love to relive the rest of my life. I would not go back and change anything, I don't believe in that. I would just like to continue.    Ms. West: What major changes have you seen in the county and in the country over your lifetime, or as part of your life, because you have a long way to go yet?    Mr. Booth: One of the things I am still trying to deal with is the lack of respect that children and youngsters show to their parents today. That bothers me. Another thing that bothers me is that you take a youngster today and tell them they don't have to salute the flag if they don't want to. They don't have to say prayers if they don't want to. And then we stand up in court, and the first thing they tell you do is to raise your hand, put it on the Bible, and say, "So help you God." And they swear you in. To me, that's a double standard. They take all the stuff out of school, but when you get out of school it's different. Any time you want to make a law or something like that, you have to swear yourself in with "So help me, God." I am very disturbed over that. I'm still working on that, and I have a long way to go to understand that. But I hope I will some day.    Ms. West: Having said that, what are your deepest values?    Mr. Booth: Well, I love to love people. I think that's probably my deepest value. I try to respect people, and that is respect for all people. When I was in college, there was a group of us fellows that got together, and we had an organization that dealt with all people. I don't like these organizations that deal with just some people. I think everybody should be included in whatever you do. Race has nothing to do with it, and color has nothing to do with it. Religion has nothing to do with it. It's all people. I think if you would look at a person just as a person, we'd be better off than looking at different races. We are all human. I got in trouble over that once. I wrote that on my paper in college. When it asked what race I belonged to, I wrote the human race. And man, I really got laid out for that! They thought I was being smart. But I wasn't really being smart, that is the way I felt about that situation. We are all human beings, and that is the only race that I know. But we have a long way to go with that race thing.    Ms. West: Oh, yes.    Mr. Booth: I think one day it will come about that we are just one human race. And it would be a fantastic thing.    Ms. West: What are your personal strengths?    Mr. Booth: The ability to know that I have my wife on my side. She is one of my strengths and plays an important part in my life. Another one of my strengths is the ability to look at things and try to see a positive point in whatever the situation might be.  If there is something to do, then go do it. Don't wait around for someone else to do it.    Ms. West: About eight months ago everyone was talking about the new millennium and expecting great changes and hoping for wonderful things to happen.  What are your expectations and hopes for this millennium?    Mr. Booth: As I said before, for people to get along together. That's my main expectation. I would like to see all people get along, everybody. That is one thing I would love to see.    Ms. West: Is there anything else you would like to say?    Mr. Booth: No, just thank you for this opportunity.  
MonmouthCounty;Thomas S. Smith;1917;1999;Thomas S. Smith, 1917, 1999            Remembering The 20th Century: An Oral History of Monmouth County         Assemblyman Thomas J. Smith   Date of Interview: December 15, 1999   Name of Interviewer: June West   Premises of Interview: Mr. Smith's office, Asbury Park, NJ   Birth Date of Subject: December 13, 1917   Deceased: September 26, 2002      Ms. West: Mr. Smith, tell us about yourself. How old are you? When were you born?      Mr. Smith: Well, I just turned eighty-two yesterday.      Ms. West: Happy belated birthday.  Where were you born?      Mr. Smith: Lukeville, New Jersey.      Ms. West: When did you move to Monmouth County?      Mr. Smith: I came to Monmouth County when I was two years old, so that's eighty years ago.      Ms. West: You were raised here in Monmouth County then?      Mr. Smith: Yes.  I went to elementary and secondary school here.      Ms. West: What schools did you attend?      Mr. Smith: I attended Howard University for two years.      Ms. West: Into which town did you move when you moved to Monmouth County?      Mr. Smith: I moved to Asbury Park.  I went to Banks Avenue South and Asbury Park High School.      Ms. West:  You say Banks Avenue South.  Were there two schools?      Mr. Smith: Yes, there were two schools.  The schools were segregated when I went to school.  Banks Avenue South was mainly for Blacks, and Banks Avenue North was for whites.      Ms. West: Were there two separate buildings?      Mr. Smith: No.  They were connected to a degree, but the classrooms were separate. They were joined by the auditorium in the middle. That was the spot that really divided the two schools.      Ms. West: Did the Black students and the White students have the same teachers?  Did you have the same classrooms?      Mr. Smith: No.  We had all Black teachers.  Banks Avenue North had all white teachers plus a white principle.  Banks Avenue South had a Black principle.      Ms. West: From there you went to high school in Asbury Park?      Mr. Smith: Yes, I did.      Ms. West:  In what year did you graduate from high school?      Mr. Smith: 1937.      Ms. West: During your formative years, did you have any hobbies?      Mr. Smith: Well, no. I was an athlete. I played football and track, and didn't develop hobbies until later. I was working most of the time.      Ms. West: Did you play football for Asbury Park High School?  Did you play football in grade school as well?      Mr. Smith: In grade school we didn't have a football team, but in high school I played football.      Ms. West: As a youngster, what other games did you all play?      Mr. Smith: As a youngster, we played basketball in the backyards and so on.  We had some community teams that we played with or played against, and that was the extent of that.      Ms. West: In the neighborhood, did you have little scruff teams in which kids got together and just played?      Mr. Smith: Oh, yes.  We played in the playground. We played touch football and football. Of course, soccer wasn't as prominent then, but some people did play soccer.      Ms. West: You didn't have television back then, but you had the radio. Do you remember what your favorite radio programs were?      Mr. Smith: Well, I hate to say it, but it was Amos and Andy.      Ms. West: Why do you hate to say it?  They were fun.      Mr. Smith: Yes.  That's the reason we listened to them.  The Shadow Knows was that detective thing on the radio.  But we spent most of our time around the kitchen table, because that was the longest place in the house, reading, or playing cards, or discussing daily events.      Ms. West: Do you have any siblings?      Mr. Smith: Oh, yes, I had four sisters and one brother.      Ms. West: You come from a large family, so nobody ever had to want for somebody to play with, right?      Mr. Smith: We always had something going, pinochle or something.      Ms. West: What can you tell us about your family background?       Mr. Smith: Not too much. On my mother's side, the family came from Washington DC, and on my father's side, the family came from Baltimore, MD.      Ms. West: Did your mother ever compare growing up in Washington with her family to growing up in New Jersey?      Mr. Smith: Well, not exactly.  My father moved to Norfield to be near New York, because he worked in New York.  One of my sisters was sick, and the doctor recommended she live by the shore. So that's why we moved back.      Ms. West: How did you find life in Asbury Park as a Black American at that time?      Mr. Smith: As a Black American in Asbury Park at that time, we all had to live on the West side, close to the tracks and south of Asbury Avenue.  There were no Blacks north of Asbury Avenue except three Black families that lived on Second Avenue. But outside of that, there were no Blacks north of Asbury Avenue.      Ms. West: Even though the schools were segregated, did you have any interaction with the whites on the other side of the so-called tracks?      Mr. Smith: There wasn't much interaction. Even the Boy's Club was totally white at that time. It was located on Main Street.      Ms. West: Is there any location in Monmouth County or Asbury Park that has some special significance to you?      Mr. Smith: The beachfront.  The beachfront always seemed significant to me, especially during the summer months.      Ms. West: With the area being segregated, how was the beach?      Mr. Smith: The beach was segregated, too.  We were down at the lower end of the beach, just before you get to Ocean Grove, and there was a sewer pipe that ran through there, but that was the only beach that we could use.  A lot of young people started to go to Belmar. We used to walk to Belmar to swim.      Ms. West: Belmar wasn't segregated?      Mr. Smith: Well, they had a beach down there that wasn't segregated.      Ms. West: What about the concessions on the boardwalk?      Mr. Smith: Concessions on the boardwalk were all white except the one in front of our beach, which was run by Jack Harris. They built the Centario upstairs and had storage downstairs, but the only store that was occupied in Centario was run by Jack Harris.  It sold chicken and fish and stuff like that.      Ms. West: Did you do much reading as a youngster?      Mr. Smith: Oh, yes.  That's all you did, because there was nothing else to do but read. One thing we did do was make use of the library here, our library at First and Grant. At school, we'd get assignments and we'd go to the library and do our research.  It was tough to get our assignments together, but most of the time at night we sat around the kitchen table and  read novels and books.      Ms. West: Do you have a favorite book?      Mr. Smith: No.  I read westerns most of the time, because my father read westerns and they were ten cents a piece in those days.  You would find them in the paper.  I read stories by Fred Hart, and all of those authors who wrote westerns.      Ms. West: Who had a profound effect upon your life?      Mr. Smith: George Washington Carver and Booker T. Washington.  In those days, they were our heroes.      Ms. West: Could you tell us a little something about Dr. Carver, as to why he was one of your heroes?      Mr. Smith: Because of what he accomplished.  He invented a lot of things that were useful.  Even though he didn't get the credit he should have gotten, many of those things that he discovered are used today and they're very important to our way of living.      Ms. West: And Booker T. Washington?      Mr. Smith: Booker T. Washington was a literary person.  His writings were something of an inspiration to me, and they showed what could be done.  In those days, most of us who were Black were discouraged with learning, and he indicated to me that you can learn.      Ms. West: What type of music did you listen to as a youngster?      Mr. Smith: Whatever was being played at that time: jazz and Robert Covington, Jimmy Longsford, Ella Fitzgerald, Lena Horne, Josephine Baker, even though I didn't have much experience with her because she went to France. Those type of entertainers.       Ms. West: Tell me, what were the medical practices in the area when you were growing up?      Mr. Smith: We had Black doctors  some of us went to Black doctors and some of us went to white doctors. It was according to what your preference was. I remember Asbury Park at one time had three practicing physicians: Dr. Robinson, Dr. Parks, and I forget the other one's name.  We had physicians that were younger, like Dr. Harris, in the late 1940s.  But prior to that, there were the three doctors.  Otherwise, you had to go to a white doctor.      Ms. West: Was there any newspaper headline that stood out in your mind of any event?      Mr. Smith: The attack on Pearl Harbor stood out in my mind quite a bit.      Ms. West: Were you a serviceman?      Mr. Smith: No, I was a policeman at that time, and I remember I was walking down the street on Springwood Avenue and the word came over that the Japanese had attacked Pearl Harbor.  Immediately, the mayor came over and took me off my post and sent me down to the waterworks to guard the waterworks.      Ms. West: Let's go back to your college days.  You said you went to Howard University.      Mr. Smith: I went there for two years.      Ms. West: What was your major at that time?      Mr. Smith: Education.      Ms. West: And then you left college and came back to Asbury Park?      Mr. Smith: I came back to Asbury Park in 1941, and I became a police officer the same year.  I went in the service in 1942.      Ms. West: What branch of the service were you in?      Mr. Smith: In the army, Quarter Master Corps.  At that time, Blacks were only in the Quarter Master Corps.      Ms. West: What did you do after World War II?        Mr. Smith: I came back here and became a police officer.       Ms. West: How long were you on the police force?      Mr. Smith: Thirty-eight years.  For eleven of the 38 years, I served as the Chief of Police.      Ms. West: Did you just work on the Black side of town?      Mr. Smith: Originally.  Before the war, we worked the Black side of town. We called it Post Five, and a couple years after the war ended, we still were restricted to that. We couldn't ride cars, so we had to walk. A lot of patrolmen were riding cars then, but we had to walk.      Ms. West: When did that change in the police department?      Mr. Smith: Well, it changed right after the war.  There was a human cry for some Black promotions in Asbury Park.  As a result of the human cry, a group of young men got together and pressured the counsel.  I became a detective, but I was restricted to the night shift from twelve at night until eight in the morning.      Ms. West: What year was that?      Mr. Smith: I don't recall, but that was a breakthrough for us as Blacks in the Police Department.  A couple of years later I became a Sergeant. I didn't spend much time in uniform, though.  I was in plain clothes most of the time in the Detective Bureau. Then, I became Captain of the Detectives and I was in charge of the Detective Bureau, and then I became the Chief.      Ms. West: When was it that people of color could work the day shift?      Mr. Smith: As a patrolman, you're rotated three shifts: eight to four  four to twelve  twelve to eight.  Every week you would change, but in the Detective Bureau I was assigned to work at night, sometimes eight at night until four in the morning, and sometimes twelve at night until eight in the morning.      Ms. West: Is there any one person, other than a Black person, who helped you in your career or influenced you?      Mr. Smith: I had a partner by the name of Pat Moiner.  He stood by me and supported me and advised me about the mechanics of getting ahead in the police department.      Ms. West: Would you want to elaborate upon that?      Mr. Smith: Well, he always encouraged me.  Sometimes you get frustrated in police work, but he always told me that that was part of the job and you just have to forget that and go on with your work everyday and do what you can do to solve crimes.      Ms. West: As you began to establish a position in the community, how did this affect the other Blacks in the community?      Mr. Smith: Oh, it brought them up, too.  It made them feel better, and I think they appreciated it, as I did too.  It also gave them a thought that we weren't throwaways anymore.  We could get in a position to move.      Ms. West: After you left the police department, what turn did your life take?      Mr. Smith: Well, I retired from the police department in 1979.  Then, I sort of got interested in politics.  I ran for City Council, was elected, and served four years as Councilman.      Ms. West: What year was that?      Mr. Smith: It was in the late 1980s.  I ran for councilman, I was elected, and then I ran for council again.  I was re-elected and made mayor.      Ms. West: Of Asbury Park?      Mr. Smith: Yes.      Ms. West: And how long were you mayor of Asbury Park?      Mr. Smith: Four years.  I served on the council for eight years in all: four as councilman, another four as mayor.      Ms. West: With what party affiliation?      Mr. Smith: Well, at that time we were bi-partisan here on a local level. But I was a Republican, actually.  I still am.      Ms. West: As an African American and as a Republican, how were you received in the Republican Party?      Mr. Smith: The Republican Party asked me to run for something.  I actually didn't solicit it, they came to me. I was in Florida at the time and I got a telephone call.  The person on the other end of the line said to me, "Would you run for assembly?"  I said, "All right, let me give you my answer when I get back. I will be back in two days."  That gave me time to talk to my family.  That was a monumental move and the family needed to be involved in it.  They encouraged me, so when I came back, I gave them the answer: "Yes.  I would run."      Ms. West: Did you ask why you were running?      Mr. Smith: No, I didn't ask why.  It was a chance for a Black breakthrough, especially with respect to the Assembly, because we never had a Black person from Monmouth County or this district in the Assembly.  And the Republicans had often made a position for African Americans to run with their backing, which is very important.  So I said, "Let me take advantage of this and run."      Ms. West:  What was the advantage?      Mr. Smith: The advantage that I had their backing. It's very hard to win an election without the backing of a party. If you understand what I'm saying, in politics, the party backing is very important. Very few independents win. You have to realize that I lived here all my life. I went to school here. I played sports here. I was an All State Mention in football and people knew me. All the families in my neighborhood knew me and if I did something wrong, they would tell my parents. You know, like you say, it takes a village to raise a child, and I assure you it takes a whole neighborhood, in fact  this town, to raise a child. This village  doesn't exist anymore. You have to realize one thing: I was popular way back then. I hate to say it that way, but everybody knew me. I became a police officer, I became more popular. The word spread who I was. I was always fair out there and if I thought a guy didn't do something that he was charged with, I would try very hard to investigate it and find out if he did or if he didn't. And if he didn't do it, I tried very hard to bring it to the authorities and tell them that this didn't happen. I had two instances of my life when that happened and one was with a juvenile who was charged with rape. An investigation came out that he couldn't  possibly have committed the rape, but he was charged with it. Eventually I got him released. Another situation was on a narcotic raid when a certain person planted narcotics in the car. Chief of County Detectives and myself had searched the car and we didn't find anything. Another person went out there and he found narcotics. He planted him, actually. They charged the owner of the car with the offense, but with two investigations and a talk with the prosecutor, it was agreed there was no way possible that it could happen. We got the charge withdrawn.      Ms. West: Now as an Assemblyman, what changes have you been able to make here in the county?      Mr. Smith: Well, I deal  mostly with quality life issues and also urban problems. Education is very important to me, and I've managed to get Neptune back in the Special Needs District, which was needed. In regards to Asbury Park, I got them in the Urban Enterprise Zone to try to lift the city up. And in Long Branch I have helped with recreation. I've gotten money for soccer fields and I've gotten money for restoration to historic sites especially in Long Branch where they managed to get forty thousand dollars to put a roof on an historic building.      Ms. West: Historic sites such as?      Mr. Smith: The one in Long Branch, the old school, I forget the name of the school. They took over the school, but  the roof was leaking.       Ms. West: How has the county changed over the years?      Mr. Smith: Well, the county has changed because the increase of population.  We're getting more Democrats in from North Jersey  which creates a problem  with us  Republicans. This used to be a totally Republican county.      Ms. West: If you could describe your life as a road map, how would you describe it, things ran smooth, up and down, rocky, diverse?      Mr. Smith: Things never ran smoothly.  But it actually hasn't been that difficult because you could overcome all the obstacles that were facing your path, and being a Black person, many obstacles were placed in my path. I remember when I took the exam for Chief of Police. The first time I took it I placed first, but they chose the second man. The second time I was chosen, I think, because  Martin Luther King raised the social consciousness and that of this nation that had a lot to do with my becoming Chief of Police.      Ms. West: What year was that then?      Mr. Smith: I was Chief of Police since 1968.      Ms. West: If you could choose a symbol for your life that would represent your life what would it be?      Mr. Smith: I've always prided myself on being fair. I prided myself on wanting to do something for people. I prided myself for wanting to do something for my community. When I say my community we can't just say Asbury, because communities are so intertwined that it goes as far as Freehold of being part of the community, even though it is not part of my district.   I have accomplished some things that affect the lives of people, especially the young people, and also me as an individual.      Ms. West: What so-called words of wisdom would you give the youth today?      Mr. Smith: Well, our youth today need a lot of shoring up. Our youth have lost hope. They've lost hope and that's the reason why we have so many problems with our youth.  The loss of hope is mainly because of us. We have not given them that emphasis to continue on, the idea that regardless of what obstacles are in your way, you can side step them and go around them and get the thing done.  The one thing we have to instill in our youth today is hope.      Ms. West: What would you consider your greatest achievement?      Mr. Smith: There are many things that I could name that I can consider achievements, but not my greatest achievement. The greatest achievement I think  is that I was  able to raise my son and educate him, and he's now sitting judge. He sits in Superior Court in another county.      Ms. West: Do you have just the one child?      Mr. Smith: Just the one child. We have three grand children, three girls. One has two masters degrees, and the other one is working on her masters, and the third one is a junior in college.      Ms. West: That's wonderful.      Mr. Smith: We believe in education.      Ms. West: What's the most unusual thing about you?      Mr. Smith:  I'm just a plain guy.   I have a good family life. I've been married to the same women for fifty-seven years. We can look back when we had nothing, but we were talking the other day about how lucky we have been.      Ms. West: In what way is your life different today than what you thought it might have been when you were a youngster?      Mr. Smith: Well, see, in those days we didn't have the luxury to dream  we didn't dream. We just took every day like it was. I remember that when I was in Asbury Park, before I went to Washington to go to school, I took any job I could get. I remember working twelve hours a day for seven days a week on the Boardwalk, on the beachfront rather. I remember digging ditches in Spring Lake for one dollar an hour. All those things come back to me, and when I tell my son, he doesn't believe it. Because I came through the Depression I know what the Depression did and what it was. I was the only one working in my family at that time -- and a family of six and eight. I used to set up pins in the bowling alley and make seventy-five cents a night. My mother was a terrific cook. I'd give her the seventy-five cents  she'd fix a meal. We'd have a good meal. It taught me that life isn't as easy as you think it is and often it is difficult because you have a lot of hurdles to jump, but if you stay in there, and you just say, "I'm not going to let this deter me," you can get it done.      Ms. West: Is there anything else that you would like to accomplish in life that you think you haven't?      Mr. Smith: The whole thing that I would like to accomplish in life or see it accomplished  is that Asbury Park comes back. The Asbury Park situation worries me and I'd like to see it come back. It can come back and I think it will come back, but the ultimate question is how and when it's going to come back  that's the big question.      Ms. West: Being an assemblyman from the county, is there anything that you could do personally towards this endeavor?      Mr. Smith: Well, we're trying everything we can to do it, but you have to realize that this is a local matter involving  the City Council and other powers. We've offered our help and the State has offered its help.      Ms. West: What are your deepest values?      Mr. Smith: Truth and honesty. You have to be honest with yourself and you have to be truthful with your people and yourself.  Our marriage has survived fifty-seven years because we are truthful with each other and honest.      Ms. West: What concerns you most about the State of New Jersey?      Mr. Smith: What concerns me most about the State of New Jersey is that there have been centers within the State of New Jersey which need a great deal of help, especially with  education.  I'm watching the Abbot decision about how much money they're going to put into school construction, because a great number of our urban schools are in very bad need of repairs or new school construction. In fact, Asbury Park wants to build a new school, and some money would probably come out of the Abbot decision, but we don't know how far that's going to go. And this is the point: we don't know what the legislature is going to do. Are the monies  going to be given out? There's one group that wants to give ninety percent funding and there's another group that wants one hundred percent. So politics is the outer compromise that gets things done. I would say that right now we may get ninety-five percent, but still there are urban centers that can't afford the five percent they're going to have to put up because taxes are already high, because of the the low tax collection rate they're in. If they get below eighty per cent, they're in trouble, and Asbury Park is very near that.      Ms. West: What major changes have you seen in this country in your lifetime?      Mr. Smith: One of the major changes since I was kid is that most of us Blacks had menial jobs back then. Today, we have Blacks in every area in employment and we have good doctors. We have some very successful lawyers. All these things have changed during my lifetime.      Ms. West: Are there any stories or anecdotes or anything of this nature that you would pass down to the younger generation?      Mr. Smith: The younger generation has to know history. They have to know what happened prior to them becoming adults. If we don't know where we were, then we don't know where we're going. Our youths don't  know what happened back in 1900 that changed where were at now. That knowledge gives them direction on where they want to go.      Ms. West: What do you consider your personal strength?      Mr. Smith: I think it is the conviction that  I have to make the quality of life better for my people: to make it easier for them to live, because a great number are suffering right now. They're in this office everyday. I want to make sure that we get our piece of the pie.      Ms. West: Well, now there's just a few days left in the century, a few days left until a new millennium. What are your feelings overall about things as we approach the new millennium? What insights would you like to share?      Mr. Smith: The new millennium is going to create some problems for us, but I think of what we've been doing the past twenty years as a race. We don't like to say that everything we wanted has been done, but in the next millennium, if we play our cards right, we can achieve the goals we really want. We have to set our goals, and if we set our goals, I think we can attain them in the next millennium.      Ms. West: Is there anything you want to add?      Mr. Smith: I would say this that the world has been good to me. I came out of the service without getting killed and came back to work. I've never known what is is to be out of a job: since I was eleven years old I've been in the work force during the summers and after school. My wife and I were talking the other night, and she said, "Do you realize that since we've been married, you've never been out of a job?" And I never realized it until I sat down and we had dinner and she said, "You had never been out of a job," and I look back and it's true.      Ms. West: Thank you very much for this interview, Assemblyman Smith      Mr. Smith: Thank you.              
MonmouthCounty;Theodore J. Narozanick;1920;2000;Theodore J. Narozanick, 1920, 2000        Remembering the 20th Century: An Oral History of Monmouth County    Theodore Narozanick  Theodore Narozanick  Date of Interview: June 30, 2000  Name of Interviewer: Sherry Conohan  Premises of Interview: Hall of Records, Freehold, NJ  Birthdate of Subject: October 22, 1920    Ms. Conohan:  My name is Sherry Conohan, and I am a reporter at the Asbury Park Press. I have covered Ted through the years and through many different phases. So perhaps we ought to begin with the beginning. Ted, please tell me where and when you were born, and where you grew up.    Mr. Narozanick: Thank you very much. It is nice to be able to be with you for a recording this morning. I was born and raised in Englishtown. As a matter of fact, where the Catholic Church is today in Englishtown, that was our property…our lawn. The home that we lived in is where the Rectory is now. Upon my dad passing away, my mother then didn’t need all that property, so she sold it to the Diocese. We had no Catholic Church in town at that time. We would meet in various homes. But that was really the start of the Catholic Church in the Borough of Englishtown.    Ms. Conohan: What is the name of the church?    Mr. Narozanick: Our Lady of Mercy Catholic Church. Of course it is a big parish now. With the advent of all the developments around Englishtown, they have got a really big parish. They have just completed a Parish Center now, and that is adjacent to the church. So they are doing very, very well.    Ms. Conohan: When was that approximately that your mother sold the property?    Mr. Narozanick: I think it could have been around the later part of 1959 or 1960, somewhere in there.    Ms. Conohan: Was your family a long-time Monmouth County family?    Mr. Narozanick: Oh yes. We were continually in Monmouth County, sure. My dad was a country auctioneer. Of course I remember that during the Depression days, many of the farmers were so bad off financially that they would hold the sales, and my dad would be the auctioneer. This was primarily an agricultural area. They would sell their produce, the farm equipment, the machinery, etc. And he, of course, got a small commission for that. He, along with a retired school teacher, and an owner of some lands where the Englishtown Auction is presently today, started that as The Englishtown Sales Company. Primarily that was to be an outlet for the farmers to dispose of their surplus stock…poultry, livestock, horses, donkeys, cows, sheep, goats, and whatever they had, plus their fruits and vegetables that they raised on the farms. Of course after the War years, it started to take on the atmosphere of a flea market, which it presently is today. But it was primarily started to help the farmers in the area around Englishtown.    Ms. Conohan: How did your family fare in the Depression?    Mr. Narozanick: Well, they fared pretty well, I would say. We didn’t have an awful lot, that’s for sure. It got to the point where my dad was trying to do the auctioneering, and my mother then took a job at the Karagheusian Rug Mill here in Freehold for many years. There were several ladies from Englishtown who would travel together and go to work in the rug mill here, at the Karagheusian Rug Mill. And that lasted for a few years, and of course it helped out. But it was rough going in those days.    Ms. Conohan: What were the roads like in those days? Did you have a lot of paved roads?    Mr. Narozanick: We had a lot of dirt roads and of course we also had some roads that were tar. At that time most of the road work was done by putting a coat of oil on the roadway and then treating it with some very small stones, just to give it a cover like. But it didn’t last very long. Of course our major highway was the road from Englishtown to Freehold, which was a paved road at that time and still is today.    Ms. Conohan: Oh, that’s very interesting. How old were you when World War II broke out, and how did you come to go into the Army?    Mr. Narozanick: Well, as you know, in 1939 and 1940, there was a lot of disruption in Europe. Hitler was invading various countries and whatnot, and I think in 1939, he invaded Poland. And there was a lot of talk and unrest in the country here, that eventually we were going to have to go to war. And one night in Englishtown, there was very little for us young people to do. We had a few stores on the main street  the primary store where we all congregated in the evening was a soda fountain. It had a very long porch, and we’d all sit on that long porch and leave enough room for people to get into the front door to get ice cream, soda, or whatever. And that’s where we would talk and discuss all kinds of issues. I think I was about twenty.    Ms. Conohan: What was the name of the soda fountain?    Mr. Narozanick: It was run by a man and woman by the name of Smith…Ferrell Smith, I think it was. It was right on the main street, and it was associated right next door to an American store, which was operated by a fellow by the name of Wilbur Erickson. We sat there on this night in particular, and somebody suggested that if we went into the service and did our year, we could be put on reserve. That way we’d only do a year and then come back. A couple of the fellows had cars. As I recall, a group of us came into Freehold to join the Army, and do our year. Where the 4-H and the agricultural section is today on Court Street, was vacant, was being used by the Army as a Recruiting Office, and it was also being used as a Branch of the New Jersey National Guard. That was the 44th Infantry Division at that time. And there were two units in Freehold, Company A and Company B of the 119th Quartermaster Regiment. And those were the two units that were stationed in Freehold. So we came into Freehold that evening, and I’ll never forget this. Our doctor from Englishtown, Sam Barr, was in uniform and was in the Army. We walked in, and we said we wanted to join the Army, and he swore us in, and he gave us a very light physical to prove we were in shape, and that was it. He told us to report at five or six o’clock the next morning, because we were then in the Army. I went home and told my mother that I had just joined the Army, and I would need to get up real early the next morning. And that overcame her, God bless her! That just overcame her and she sort of fainted away, and we had to revive her. Nevertheless, I got up the next morning and we came and reported at the Court Street Office here, and they took us over to Conway’s Bar, which is where the Court Jester is today. And we had some breakfast, and we would drill and practice being a soldier all day long out on the streets here in Freehold. We had no uniforms, so we were all in civilian clothes. But we would go home at night and sleep, and then come back the next morning. We did that for several days and one Saturday, there were a lot of Army trucks parked out here on Court Street. When we saw the trucks, the order was given to us to get in the trucks, and we were going to Fort Dix. We were the first group to occupy Fort Dix since World War I. They still had those black tarpaper barracks. When we got to Ft. Dix my assignment was to go out on a truck and visit the various farmers and get as much straw as I could, so when we got back to Ft. Dix we could fill up bags or sacks, to make mattresses to sleep on. The other group had a detail that was sent to find where the kitchen was and clean the old stoves from World War I. Another group went out and found soft coal, and another group would be trying to clean the inside of the barracks for us. And we stayed there for quite some time. You know it is surprising, Sherry, all this period of time that we were there in Ft. Dix, it must have been a good two months, we still had no uniforms. We were still in civilian clothes. Finally we did start getting pieces of uniforms from a depot, which at that time was in Philadelphia. Some would get riding breeches that you would use when you rode a horse or a motorcycle. Others would get a campaign hat with a big brim on it. Others would get an ordinary hat. Some would get a brown pair of pants, and some got a beige shirt or pants. So we were really not in uniform completely. That was how we mustered down in Ft. Dix on September 16th of 1940, and I think it was probably the latter part of August that we signed up and came into the Army. After we were in Ft. Dix for awhile, we then went on maneuvers down South. Of course by that time, we had our uniforms. We had a great deal of equipment, a lot of trucks and vehicles, guns, and whatever we needed we had at that time.    Ms. Conohan: When you say you went down South, where did you go?    Mr. Narozanick: The Carolinas. Then when we were coming back to Ft. Dix, we stayed overnight at the Gettysburg Battleground. That was just for overnight, and then we went back to Ft. Dix the next day. That’s the time that we heard that the Japanese had bombed Pearl Harbor. So we knew then that we were in the Army permanently. There was no "year" for us to do and then get back. So my service in the Army amounted to a little over five years…almost 5 ½ years.    Ms. Conohan: When did you ultimately get out?    Mr. Narozanick: I was discharged on December 28, 1945, right after the War.    Ms. Conohan: You went through the whole war in the Army.    Mr. Narozanick: I went overseas to the European Theatre Operations, and we went through the invasion at Normandy, which either was D plus 2 or 3, I just can’t recall the date today. But I know all of our vehicles were prepared to go over and through the water.    Ms. Conohan: Were you in England?    Mr. Narozanick: Oh, yes, we were stationed in England. That’s where we did a lot of training there. When we were in England, we were also given a lot of training on waterproofing a vehicle. That is to say we had this heavy grease, which was called kosmoline at that time. We would take that and practice every day on a jeep or a truck, and we would cover the engine with all this heavy grease. We would put a pipe in through the carburetor and position it vertically for air so that if we in water, the jeep or vehicle would still be able to operate. And it came in handy because when we got off the ship that took us across the channel, we naturally didn’t go right to the beach, so we were out in the water. And when you sat in the jeep, you were up to your waist or maybe up to your neck in water, but you were still sitting in the jeep.    Ms. Conohan: And you were driving through the water?    Mr. Narozanick: And the jeep was still going, up onto the beach.    Ms. Conohan: And that kosmoline grease worked?    Mr. Narozanick: Oh, it absolutely worked. We had no failure with any vehicle that I recall.    Ms. Conohan: That is amazing.    Mr. Narozanick: Yes. When we hit the beach, the paratroopers were coming back, because they had landed on D-Day early in the morning. And when they were coming back, they had a tremendously rough time. They had those big jumpsuits on with the huge pockets on the front side of their legs, and all the paratroopers looked like they had gone through a battle. You could tell that. But they had a lot of bottles of champagne and cognac, pistols, revolvers, and German guns stuffed in their pockets that they had picked up when they encountered the Germans over there.     Ms. Conohan:  Did those paratroopers share some of their stories with you as you were coming ashore?    Mr. Narozanick: Not really. They were so anxious to get off, and we were just getting on the beach. They were all in a line two abreast, and they were all heading for the beach where there were landing crafts that were going to take them out to the boats that would take them back to England for rest and relaxation.    Ms. Conohan: So there were people coming off the boats, and then the paratroopers were going on those same boats to go back to England.    Mr. Narozanick: Yes.    Ms. Conohan: What did you do after you got on the beach?    Mr. Narozanick: Well, after we got on the beach, it was a very rough situation. We had so many vehicles in our Company. During the early part of 1942, I was stationed still at Ft. Dix, but then we were transferred to Ft. Hancock, which was right here in our own county. We were there for a short while. However, while we were in Ft. Hancock, I did make the baseball team. I still have photographs at home that show Ft. Hancock written across my chest, with various poses of me with a bat and a glove. I was a pretty good baseball player in those days.    Ms. Conohan: And we should explain for people who may not remember it that Fort Hancock is out on Sandy Hook and is now part of the Gateway National Park.      Ted Narozanick at Officer Candidate School in Virginia, December 1942  Mr. Narozanick: We were there for quite some time. As a matter of fact, we were supposed to play our first game with Governor’s Island, as I recall, and before the first game came we practiced every day. But before the first game was to take place, we were all transferred again…this time down South again. Some of us went to Virginia, some went to South Carolina, and some went to Fort Moultrie, South Carolina. I went to The Citadel at South Carolina, which was just on the outskirts of Charleston, South Carolina. And we were training there again, going through all of our rituals of being a soldier. While I was in South Carolina, I applied for Officer Candidate School. And I was successful. I went from South  Carolina in the early part of 1942, I guess toward the fall or winter of 1942, to Camp Lee, Virginia. That was the Officer Candidate School, and I was in Class #11. For ninety days they gave you such intensive training that at the end of it, you graduated and got your bars and uniform, and you were then "an officer and a gentleman." That was all in ninety days, but the training was so intensive that many of the men got to the point where they didn’t want to take that regimentation, you know. You would be subject to "call out" early in the morning with a pack on your back, and you would do various things just to be tested to see what you could do and if you would blow up. Do you know what I mean? So many of the men would be washed out of the class. Nevertheless, we graduated in December of 1942. After I graduated I was sent back to Camp Lee, Virginia, to instruct officers who were receiving a commission and who were coming into the Army. If a man was a very financial expert or he had something to do with transportation like trucks or buses or rail, they were given an outright commission. They were sent down to Virginia, and we would train those people, because they had no exposure to military life at all. I was an instructor there for transportation, even in those days with trucks and vehicles. I stayed there for quite some time. You know a funny thing happened when I was in Camp Lee, Virginia. One day at the mess hall, I sat next to a colonel. We got to talking, and I asked him where he was from. He said he was from Monmouth County, New Jersey. Well, I was from Monmouth County, too. So I asked him where, and he said it was actually Sea Girt. That was where he lived and was raised, but now he was in the service as a full colonel. He said he was there to get the training, and that was when we were training these officers at that time. He said he hoped to be transferred to the China Burma India Theatre of Operations, which was a rough assignment to get in those days. You know what the China Burma Road was? They had to build roads over the mountains to transport supplies and move men and equipment. He said he would like to take me with him if I was interested in going. He said he would try and get a transfer for me if I was. But I said no thanks, I wasn’t ready for the China Burma India Theatre. I don’t know whatever happened to him. But that was one experience with Colonel Bell. But I never did get his first name. But that is the closest I came to meeting someone right from our own area.     Ms. Conohan: When did you transfer over to Europe?    Mr. Narozanick: Let’s see, that might have been the latter part of 1943 or the early part of 1944. I know I have all of these dates written down, but I just don’t have them with me. I think it might have been January of 1944.    Ms. Conohan: Did you go directly to England?    Mr. Narozanick: No. After I left Camp Lee, I was transferred from being an instructor there to a new camp that was just being organized at Granada, Mississippi. I had never heard of it  the name of the camp was Camp McCane. I got a ten-day leave to come home, and I spent some vacation time at home. Then I reported back to this Camp McCane, Mississippi, and it was in Granada. It was a brand new camp. There were no sidewalks or anything, it was just out in the field. There were some tents and some barracks, but that is where we did our training. I picked up a Company and was then called a Company Commander. Even though I was a Second Lieutenant, I still had a Company Command to train. And we trained there a long time, and I know we had to go through our twenty-six mile hike, which was mandatory. You had to do that. After we completed that, that was the final part of our training. Then we were put on a train, and we didn’t know where we were going. We had all of our equipment. But as time went by, I would try to see along the track if we could pick up any license plates from the vehicles you could see from the track. I finally started picking up a lot of Jersey plates, so I knew we were going somewhere in Jersey, which we did. We finally got off the train at Camp Kilmer, New Jersey, which was on the outskirts of New Brunswick. And that morning we got off the train, I had all my troops lined up, and I was leading them down the street into Camp Kilmer. And I’ll never forget this, either. They were still building that camp at that time, and there were a lot of union carpenters still working on it, for the government and developers that were building these barracks. As I was walking down the street with my troops behind me, I could hear somebody on top of one of the barracks shout, "Hey, Ted!" And low and behold, it was my uncle that lived in South River, and he was a carpenter!    Ms. Conohan: What was his name?    Mr. Narozanick: Louie Brustowitz. He is dead now, but it was Louis. He was a carpenter and had been working on a barrack, and he knew that I was there. As soon as he got home, he called my mother and father in Englishtown and told them I was at Camp Kilmer.    Ms. Conohan: Do you have any brothers and sisters?    Mr. Narozanick: Oh yes, I have two brothers and two sisters. After I went into the Army my oldest brother went into the Navy.  He also participated in Normandy, but he was on a Navy ship. We trained at Camp Kilmer for only a short while. Then one day we were put on a train and taken to the piers in New York, and we boarded the S.S. Aquitania, which was a British Ship. There was no convoy or anything, but we got on that British ship that took us to Scotland. We embarked off the ship in Scotland, and then we got on a British train that took us into England. Again, I’m not familiar with the name of the town or anything, but I have a feeling it was near Bristol.    Ms. Conohan: After D-Day and before you got to the Battle of the Bulge, where did you move around to?      Ted Narozanick in France during World War II  Mr. Narozanick: Oh, Lord! After we went through France and through some of these small towns, the first time we were in combat was in an apple orchard. We tried to camouflage most of our vehicles and take cover. It was early evening. We could hear this plane coming, and it didn’t sound right. We thought it wasn’t an American plane. Every fourth vehicle had a ring around the top of the truck, and on that ring was mounted a 50-caliber machine gun that you could then swing around the whole 360 degrees, standing on the seats in the truck. But that ring held the gun in place. As the plane approached our area, for some reason, one of the soldiers started firing the gun, which he never should have done. But the plane went down aways, and you could hear it turning. Then the sound started getting louder and it came back to just about over the apple orchard, and it dropped a lot of what they call "anti-personnel mines." These were bombs that were made up of all kinds of metal and shrapnel and whatnot. When they dropped, they just disintegrated. It hit so many of the trucks. But none of the men where injured because they were all underneath the trucks or in a hole. But that was our first taste of combat.    Ms. Conohan: And what was your unit doing?    Mr. Narozanick: Basically we were carrying all the ammunition, the supplies, the food, gasoline, and whatever we needed for the troops to keep moving. We had to go many times and follow right in their footsteps to be sure that they had the guns, food, and ammunition they needed. We had more than sixty vehicles in our company, as I recall. And we had around two hundred men in the company.    Ms. Conohan: You mentioned earlier about an African American unit. Were there African American  soldiers with you in your Unit?    Mr. Narozanick: Yes, at that time it was all African Americans.    Ms. Conohan: That was unusual, wasn’t it?    Mr. Narozanick: Oh yes. Of course there was segregation at that time. We didn’t get desegregated until 1945, when President Truman issued that Executive Order that there would be no more African American Units but all units would be integrated.    Ms. Conohan: So you were commanding a Unit of African American men.    Mr. Narozanick: There were four Officers, and all of the four were white…myself and the other three. But we had a good unit, and we did a lot of work. We got involved in a lot of transporting…you probably heard of the Red Ball Express, which is a group of vehicles that worked twenty-four hours a day around the clock moving gasoline. We did that practically all through the War to keep up with the troops. We were part of the First United States Army, which was then commanded by General Bradley. After we got into the War quite extensively, I was then taken out of my Company Command and given a promotion, and I was sent to Battalion Headquarters. There I became like the Executive Officer.    Ms. Conohan: Was this before or after the Battle of the Bulge?    Mr. Narozanick: This was long before the Battle of the Bulge. As I was transferred to this new Battalion as Executive Officer, my job was then to try to proceed the company or the troops. I had to try to find adequate spaces for them to put their vehicles. If there was an old factory or an old building, maybe it could be suitable for housing for the troops. And that was my job then. As a matter of fact, I recall very vividly that I had a little jeep. All through my service, I had a jeep just about like that. When I had the windshield up, I had painted on the front "The Jersey." That was the name of a song at that time, and it also showed I came from Jersey. I had a driver. My job was to know where the troops were going and to try to proceed them and get them established. And my one mission was to get into Paris. We made Paris, alright, after driving quite extensively, a long period of time. Paris represents a wheel. Every avenue or street is like a spoke in the wheel, and I didn’t know really where we were going. Maps were not too helpful for us at that time. I remember an elderly man on the Champs-Elysees, the biggest street in Paris. He was standing there, and I got the driver to pull up along side him. I asked him if he spoke English, and he said he spoke very good English. He said he was a personal friend of Senator Claude Pepper from Florida at that time. He said every time Senator Pepper went overseas, they would have dinner and were very good friends. He asked where I wanted to go, and I told him I didn’t really know but wanted to try to get spots for our troops. He sat in the back seat of that jeep, right here in the back like that, and he took us to spots of Paris I had never seen or had never been to before. Nevertheless, I was able to meet the troops when they got there. But can you imagine meeting somebody that knew Senator Claude Pepper from Florida?    Ms. Conohan: What a fortunate happenstance!    Mr. Narozanick: And he was very, very helpful to us. Then I got into Luxembourg, Belgium, and Holland.    Ms. Conohan: Where were you when the Battle of the Bulge happened?    Mr. Narozanick: I was in Belgium when the Battle of the Bulge took place. I was in a small town on the outskirts of a city called Liege. From there we were transferred from the First United States Army to the Third Army…to General Patton. He came in really during the Battle of the Bulge. It was up to him to try to relieve the people at Bastogne. That was the 101st Airborne Division, the 82nd Airborne Division, and a brand new Division of seventeen and eighteen year-old boys, which was the 106th Infantry Division from the United States. And they were practically wiped out during that period of time, so they called on Patton. When he started with his armored units and whatnot, it was everything we could do to keep up with him. He was using so much gasoline, and we were following him wherever he went. So the Battle of the Bulge started on December 16, 1944 and kept up until after January or February of 1945, and then it kind of receded. The Germans knew that they were done then. During that same period of time, many of the American soldiers, especially MPs, were captured. The Germans would take their uniforms and dress as Americans. Of course then when you came down with your vehicles, they wouldn’t direct you to where you were supposed to go, but they would direct you to where the German troops were where they would massacre you and kill you all. There were many, many instances of this. We did lose some people in our vehicles, and we have never seen or heard from them again. And I know that could have been attributed to the Germans being dressed as Americans. They did that quite extensively, really. But it was a task to keep up with General Patton, with the amount of gasoline and ammunition that he needed. That was terrible. It got so that you could see a line of German soldiers that was maybe a quarter mile long just walking in line together. And we would pay no attention to them. They had no weapons…they had thrown them away.    Ms. Conohan: And they were captured by this time?    Mr. Narozanick: Yes, by the Americans. Many times we didn’t pay any attention to them. They would be walking down the highway going somewhere. But we paid no attention to them, because we knew they were done then, you know. They had no weapons.    Ms. Conohan: Were they going home or where?    Mr. Narozanick: We didn’t know where they were going, so we just kept doing what we had to do. I remember one time when we were in Belgium, although I can’t swear to that for sure, this Frenchman or Belgian came to our headquarters. We were out in this field. And he was carrying a long knife, a machete. It had a blade maybe two feet long on it. And he kept hollering "Bosch," which means "German." Of course we didn’t speak his language and he didn’t speak English, but he kept motioning us to follow him. So I took about six or seven men, and we followed this individual. I am sure he was a Belgian, as I recall it now. And he took us into this wooded area. There was an entrance where we went down into a tunnel. And when we got into this tunnel, you couldn’t see because it was so dark. You couldn’t see anything! But we knew the Germans were in there because they were ahead of us. There was a concrete bunker, and we could hear them running on the concrete because they had heavy shoes with the nails in the soles and heels. We knew they were ahead of us, and we could also hear them talking excitedly. But we couldn’t see them. So we kept going and following this Belgian person as much as we could. Every once awhile we would stop and look into a room, and in that room in this tunnel would be ammunition, straw, or some military equipment. But that’s where the Germans were, in this tunnel. After we got towards the exit, we had an encounter where we started firing our weapons. There were several Germans in there, and as I recall it, there must have been two or three who were wounded, and some were killed. The one that was wounded the most, when we got out into the open again out of the exit, he must have been sharp enough and bright enough to get the unit that we were with. And when we got out into the open, we got the vehicle to take those that were wounded to the P.O.W. Camp, where they would get medical attention and whatnot. So when he got to the P.O.W. Camp, he must have reported to somebody what had happened. And the way he reported the story was that we purposely wanted to kill them all, you know, without even trying to give them a chance. So when I was able to leave Germany and come back to the United States, I was investigated or interrogated by what they call The Inspector General’s Department. They wanted to know what the circumstances were that we got involved in an encounter with these German soldiers, and why some were wounded and some were killed. But that was the Battle! And I gave my testimony and all that, and then I was able to leave  and come home to the United States.       Ted Narozanick returning to the US after the war, September 1945  Ms. Conohan: Nothing ever came of that?    Mr. Narozanick: Nothing ever came of that. And at the same time, I knew then that my papers were in for a promotion to a Major. I was a Captain, and my papers were in for a Major. But I would have had to stay in Germany a period of time, and I didn’t elect to do that. I came home.    Ms. Conohan: Now you received an Award for Valor during the War?    Mr. Narozanick: Yes, the Bronze Star.    Ms. Conohan: When you came home from the War, what did you do when you re-entered civilian life?    Mr. Narozanick: I got home December 28, 1945.    Ms. Conohan: Oh, you just missed Christmas!    Mr. Narozanick: Yes. I thought I would like to maybe go back to school. That’s what I had in mind really. And then my dad told me one day that since there had been such a shortage of supplies and everything for the people here while the War had been going on all these years, he thought this would be an opportunity for me to open up a store. He thought it should be a hardware store with farm supplies and appliances, because we couldn’t get that stuff during the War. It was just not available. You had to be on a list to get a refrigerator or a stove. He said there was pretty big store in town that was vacant, and he knew I could buy it. He asked me if I had saved some money when I was in the service, and I said I had. He told me to think about it, and the more I thought about it, I figured that it was a real opportunity. So I did buy the building and in March of 1946, we opened the store. In just that short period of time we were able to make enough contacts for the supplies, for the hardware, for paint, appliances, housewares, farm equipment, and little tractors that people could use in their gardens and farms. Then we opened it in March of 1946.    Ms. Conohan: What was the name of the store?    Mr. Narozanick: Enterprise Hardware. It was right on the main street in Englishtown, although there was another hardware store in the town. But we were very successful, I might say. It was a tremendously important business. While I was in the community, I got involved politically. I ran for council and made that for seven years, and then I ran for mayor. I served as mayor for twelve years, and I served on the Board of Education for nine years. So I really contributed something to the community. And I liked it. And then through those years from 1946 on, Manalapan Township started to develop. Highway 9 started coming through with the strip malls and stores, and there were big stores that were coming in at that time, like major chains. Then you couldn’t, as a small, independent businessman, keep up with the stock that they had, or the capital. As a matter of fact, our business started to decrease after that. And around 1954, it got so bad that I told my wife she would have to run the business and stay open as much as we could, and I would have to take a job. So I took a job with the State of New Jersey in the Division of Community Affairs, or Community Services, as an auditor. And my job was to go around to various communities in Monmouth County that I would be assigned to, and I was to examine their books and records to see that they were doing things right. And really, that gave me a background for knowing what municipal government is all about. This was in addition to the time I served as Councilman and Mayor of Englishtown. But this background really was of tremendous help. I took a job with them for $3,120 a year  can you imagine that? I started there in 1954 and I served until 1957. One of the towns that I was assigned to look at their records and audit, was the City of Long Branch. At that time they had a Commissioner, Walton Sherman, who was also President of the Central Jersey Bank & Trust Company, and he was also a Freeholder. He was in charge of Finance in the County here. We knew each other from Long Branch. There was a vacancy in the Department of Finance at the County in 1957, when the chief accountant was released, so Sherman called me and told me there was a job open, and he asked if I would take the position. My first task would be to put the budget together for 1957. I had the background in budgeting and whatnot, so I said I would take the job. I started here on January 1, 1957, right downstairs. That’s when I came with the County of Monmouth, and we worked together. I got $6,420 in 1957…that was my salary. I worked there for the next twenty-seven years and three months as the Director of Finance. In 1974, I was appointed as the first County Administrator. I retired in 1984, after twenty-seven years and three months. Then in 1985, I ran for election to the Board. And we have been successful ever since. I am now in my fifth term. This November, I will be seeking my sixth term.    Ms. Conohan: What is it that you like most about politics?    Mr. Narozanick: I think meeting the people and seeing  what I can help them with, regardless of their problem. I have no line of demarcation, so to speak, whether they are a Republican, Democrat, Conservative, Independent, or Liberal. It makes no difference to me. If they are county residents and I can help them, that’s my responsibility and my job. And that’s what I try to do. Not only is it a situation of helping somebody in governmental operations, but in other things.    Ms. Conohan: You are the Freeholder in charge of, among other things, Health & Human Services.    Mr. Narozanick: Health & Human Services and Transportation.    Ms. Conohan: You must get involved with a lot of very personal stories.    Mr. Narozanick: Sherry, it is with the homeless, the disabled, people who need food stamps, people who have no place to live  they all know that they can call Ted Narozanick. The typical case goes like this. Yesterday morning I had to do a little extra work, but we got a call that there was a man who had served in the United States Army, served in the Pacific Theatre of Operations, and he is now confined to a nursing home. He has serious health conditions, and the family would like to bury him in a Veteran’s Cemetery, but they couldn’t find any of his records. No discharge or anything! And you must prove all that before you can be interred into a Veteran's Cemetery. So it meant calling the Congressman’s office, getting the various forms, writing a letter, and getting somebody in the family who would take the time to fill out a form for privacy. I did all this to help them see if we could get his records out of St. Louis so that they can eventually bury him in a Veteran’s Cemetery.    Ms. Conohan: Of course that's complicated by the fact that the Records Center in St. Louis had a big fire a few years back.    Mr. Narozanick: A big fire, absolutely! So that is one typical example, but it goes on. Robert Tansy has a problem in the Morganville Fire Department, and then of course there is Stanley Rippish about the Route 33 Bypass. Richard Hartshorne has got a problem with the State of Israel Bonds…he needs an honoree…and it goes on and on and on.    Ms. Conohan: And transportation is the other area that you are principally involved in?    Mr. Narozanick: Yes, that’s right.    Ms. Conohan: You are quite an expert on that.    Mr. Narozanick: I don’t know if I am an expert on it, but I am the first Vice Chairman of the North Jersey Transportation Planning Authority. We primarily deal with the thirteen northern region counties, as far as Ocean County. We have a twenty-member voting board. We take care of more than six million people, and we have roughly about $5.9 billion to approve and to prepare transportation improvement programs for the distribution of Federal and State money for both the Department of Transportation and New Jersey Transit and the State of New Jersey. So it’s a tremendously important operation.  We just adopted our Transportation Improvement Program July 10 in Newark. This covers all the various programs by county for the thirteen northern counties that we have. It shows what they are going to do during the years 2001-2003.    Ms. Conohan: Of course today, you were very much in the news with the progress that has been made on the ‘MOM' line, as it has been called. This particular day,  July 18th 2000, and you just got the legislation approved by the Legislature and signed by the Governor that puts that project for rail service to Ocean County on the circle of mobility. How long, Ted,  have you been working on this?    Mr. Narozanick: We  have been working on that for seven or eight years. The ‘MOM’ Study goes back many, many years. I would say fifteen or sixteen years or maybe more than that. But what a step that has been for us when the Legislature and the Governor signed that legislation providing that MOM Study in the Circle of Mobility. Because then that permits us to apply for Federal funding, and it gives us some recognition under the Inner Mode of Surface Transportation Efficiency Act. It will also help us in the Transportation Trust Fund. So we have got everything to gain! Admittedly, we do have a problem with some communities that are not in favor of it. Whether or not there is a legitimate reason, that can be debated. But I expect that there is a lot of politics involved, too, regarding it.    Ms. Conohan: And do you think that this rail line, which you certainly hope goes through Western Monmouth County as opposed to any other route, will come about in a reasonable amount of time?    Mr. Narozanick: I would be very hopeful that it would. Right now there is such a situation with commuter transportation and the impatience of people dealing with congestion. No matter where you go, you have to take into consideration the amount of time that it takes you to get from one spot to another. And the congestion today is getting worse. It’s not getting any better.    Ms. Conohan: It’s a far cry from those days when your mother was traveling to the rug mill.    Mr. Narozanick: Absolutely! Today the Highway 9 is our main line into North Jersey and to the City, and today you just can’t get any more vehicles on it! Now they are trying to provide another opening over the river. You can see the bridge being constructed. That’s going to take some time. But in the meantime, we are at least making some headway and some progress for another mode of transportation, the rail line. It will help us additionally here in our County when the State starts construction of the Route 33 bypass. You know the difficulty it is getting through the Borough of Freehold today, the way the traffic is. And especially the major truck traffic. This would be a major help to us in the Borough of Freehold. I hope they will be starting that construction in another week or so.    Ms. Conohan: Yes, that will be quite an accomplishment.    Mr. Narozanick: Absolutely.    Ms. Conohan: And that’s also been going on for years and years.    Mr. Narozanick: Really it started in 1960. However, it never was completed. And we have about a mile and five eighths to finish. Hopefully now that the contract has been awarded, and I see they are starting to move equipment in already on the highway, they should start in another week or so. And that will be a tremendous help to us!    Ms. Conohan: Well Ted, you made mention of the fact that you are running again for re-election this year. While I am sure you have had the chance to think about your accomplishments when you campaign, what are some of the things that you are going to be mentioning?    Mr. Narozanick: Well, since I started here in 1986, I have been a full-time Freeholder. This has been my occupation. I am here to really help the people. And as I indicated before, it makes no difference to me what party affiliation they have. If I can help, then that’s what I want to do. I think we have done many major things in the County of Monmouth  that have been for the betterment of everybody. Things that have improved the quality of life. I am a great supporter of open spaces. As a matter of fact, I had a great deal to do with the original legislation that came about in 1987, giving us the opportunity to raise additional money for acquiring open spaces. We had another program in 1996 that made ten cents altogether. The original was four cents, and then we added the six cents, so now we have ten cents of open space acquisition funding provided in the County. So that was a major step. It was also a major issue getting some of the communities to become members of  Health & Social Services, a provision for  the starting of The Health Department.  We could have a coordinated effort then with Health activities. I think the establishment of the Library system is one of the major components that we can be proud of today in County Government. The Park system, the Library system, the Solid Waste system are also important projects. I remember doing a tremendous amount of work on establishment of the Reclamation Center and the Solid Waste system. This was really provided for under my term as County Administrator. That is where that started, really. So there have been so many things. We are concerned about our historical heritage and are working with the Historical Commissions and the Historical Societies in the County so that our people know of our heritage. I have put a lot of attention into helping the veterans within the various organizations that we have. We try to make sure the veterans are aware of what is going on, and any benefits that they might receive, and to try to help the veterans as much as we can. We need to recognize their efforts and their service, whether it was the European Theatre of Operations, the Pacific, Korea, Vietnam, or whatever. We try to help them with whatever we can do. Basically my career has been based on a love of County Government, the knowledge of it to know what we can and cannot do, and how we can be helpful to all the people.    Ms. Conohan: And just one final question. I thought it might be appropriate to close with a little bit about your family. Tell me how many years you have been married now.    Mr. Narozanick: My wife and I were married while I was in the Service in 1942, so we are in our fifty-eighth year right now. May 7th we celebrated our fifty-eighth wedding anniversary. My wife Margaret and I have one daughter, Carol, and she has three sons. They are all doing very well, and we have seven great-grandchildren now. One of the three boys works for public service in electric & gas in the City, one is in the heating & ventilating, and the third one is a professional engineer. He is the youngest one, and he got his license about seven or eight months ago from the State of New Jersey, so now he is practicing as an engineer. So they are all doing very well.    Ms. Conohan: That’s wonderful! And what is your wife’s maiden name?    Mr. Narozanick: Margaret Stillwell. She was born and raised in Matawan, New Jersey. I met her while I was in the Service at the Hightstown Country Club. It’s an establishment that is still in existence. All they do is sponsor ballroom dancing one night a week. While I was in the Service at Fort Dix, I went to that dance one night at Hightstown, and that’s where I met her. And we kept up a relationship and eventually got married in 1942.    Ms. Conohan: Congratulations! Before we close, I would like to ask you if there is anything that you would like to add to our conversation that we haven’t covered?    Mr. Narozanick: Well, Sherry, I have often said this: I have always admired you and respected you for the way you wrote your articles in the Asbury Park Press. We have had some great times really with the press here, not only the Asbury Park Press but other periodicals. I think of all that I can remember, for the fairness of the stories, and their objectivity, and for the way you put forth the information so people can understand, you represent the highest in that field, I think. And I am very proud to be associated with you.    Ms. Conohan: Well, thank you, Ted. Thank you very much. I appreciate this conversation very much.    Mr. Narozanick: Thank you, Sherry.    Interview with Monmouth County Freeholder Theodore J. Narozanick At his office in the Hall of Records, Freehold, N.J. on July 18, 2000.    This is an additional conversation after that recorded on a disc with more details on life in Englishtown, where Narozanick served as mayor.  The interviewer is Sherry Conohan.    (This conversation begins with talk about the train and tracks in western Monmouth County.)    Mr. Narozanick: We had a station in Englishtown, which was very well occupied.    Ms. Conohan: And it would go to Trenton and kids would go to high school there.    Mr. Narozanick: Oh, yes. And many adults form Freehold were also riding the train at that time, who were working at business establishments in Trenton as well as banks and what not. It was a real treat to see that train. We had a station there. And some of the people I remember from years ago include the one who always picked up the mail from the train, Tilly Perrine. Tilly was a character by herself. She operated a Model T bus. That's Model T. That's in the 1900's, the early 1900's, when Henry Ford had a Model T. She'd pick up the mail, and I always remember her carrying a gun on her hip that probably was the size of a shotgun. But where she ever got it or what, I don't know, but always carrying that gun. Tilly. And she was the one that always reported to the train station to pick up the bags of mail.    Then I remember another man in town, we called him Gasoline Gus. He was in the gasoline business and he always would ride an old motorcycle or a bicycle, but we called him Gasoline Gus. Characters like that you'll never see again. And they had a heart as big as their head, do anything they can for you. So many things  people around town were so helpful.    Ms. Conohan: Do you remember your first campaign when you ran for the council?     Mr. Narozanick: Oh, yes, sure, absolutely.    Ms. Conohan: Was it a shock in any way when you go out there on the campaign trail or did you adapt right away?    Mr. Narozanick: Well, my first campaign, as I recall it, of course the town has predominantly been a Democratic town, Englishtown.    Ms. Conohan: And you are a Republican.    Mr. Narozanick: And I ran as a Republican. It was a little rough to get to the people because year after year we used the paper ballot and they were accustomed to voting the Democrat line all the way down the line. My dad was very much interested in politics, and he's the one who gave me the saying, "Don't hold office, but serve in office." That's where that came from. And I tried to appeal to the people and they knew that I had just come out of the service and I had some ideas and, well, they gave me an opportunity. And it took me some while to make the first major improvement in the town. There was no question. After I became mayor, I looked at certain things in the community and I said we have got to try to improve. We can't just be in the status quo.    The lake needs to be improved and cleaned. And I went to the County of Monmouth and we were able to get a grant of some $4,000.00 and we dredged the lake. And that was dredged by a man in Colts Neck, Frank Singlinger, who had the equipment and was able to say, "I know you don't have a lot of money, but I'm slow right now, I'll be able to help you dredge the lake." And he did. Main Street needed to be widened so that our businesses had an opportunity to have cars park on the main street so we widened the whole Main Street by taking land off one side, and putting in a new sidewalk. But it gave us the extra width to have a widened Main Street for parking. We needed to improve the street lighting. It was dark. You could hardly see at night in the town. We put in new street lighting. Christmas time we put up Christmas lights on the poles and decorated the town.    The major improvement was when I got to know Congressman Jim Auchincloss, who lived in Rumson. And I got very friendly with Jim Auchincloss and I invited him to Englishtown many times - and he came, surprisingly. Always with a chauffer, but always came. And we talked to him and showed him the town, how badly we needed a water supply system because in town at that time everybody had a septic tank or a cesspool and a private shallow well, and we knew the wells were polluted because when we had an inspection made by the state Department of Health, better than 80 percent of the wells in town were polluted from the septic tank and the cesspool draining into the well. Through his efforts and going to Washington, making our story known, we were able to get a little better than $200,000.00, a grant to put in a municipal water supply system and we started that. Surprisingly enough, we had some of the people in town oppose it, didn't want it. We had a lot of people who wanted it and knew the value of drinking pure water. So we started, let the contract out, and we started. I remember putting a big sign up in town, - "Pardon our progress. This is a new municipal water supply system for the health of our people." Now it's got a beautiful water system. Now they've got sewers that they were able to attract the sewers when Manalapan Township sewered some of the developments. So the town is coming now. We started it. We also got postal delivery service, of having our mail delivered to each house.    Ms. Conohan: You didn't have that? Everybody had boxes?    Mr. Narozanick: No. That's it. Had their own box in the post office and you had to go walk to the post office. But we got postal mail delivery service.    My biggest disappointment - I was not mayor then or anytime - it just happened four or five years ago, maybe longer. We had a beautiful post office in Englishtown. It was closed by the Postal Department and the office was moved to Tennent to the crossroads of Tennent on Route 522. And why did you close the post office in Englishtown, now that we're having the growth, the number of elderly people, and to move it to Tennent where you have maybe 13 houses. And not only that, but a mile down the road, they built the new Manalapan Township post office with a drive-in window so that you can deposit your mail and do your business in a drive-in, like a bank. Beautiful post office, a mile away. And here Englishtown is vacant with no post office at all. I don't understand the rationale for that.    Ms. Conohan: It's difficult to understand, that's for sure.    Mr. Narozanick: But, of course that was done a few years ago, maybe five or six years ago. Why I don't know.    Ms. Conohan: When you were mayor you also served on the Board of Education. You were a real glutton for punishment.    Mr. Narozanick: Absolutely. Altogether, I gave better than 20 years, really, of my time to the town to try to help them. I think we did major things to try to help everybody. And of course politics really never entered into it so much and it's still for me today. Although I'm on the Republican ticket, if I can help people regardless what they are or who they are, I'm here to help.    Ms. Conohan: That's terrific, Ted.    Mr. Narozanick: And I go to just about a function every night in the week somewhere.    Ms. Conohan: And I've heard from other people that you are very active right here in Freehold in a lot of service areas, helping people and children in the borough.    Mr. Narozanick: Absolutely. No question.    Ms. Conohan: You live in Freehold now?    Mr. Narozanick: Yes, since 1965.     Ms. Conohan: Tell me a couple of the organizations you work with here in Freehold.    Mr. Narozanick: I'm very friendly and active in Habitat for Humanity. I always support them. I support the Center Partnership and the Chamber of Commerce. That's primarily where I give help. I'm always with the firemen and the First Aid Squad. Whatever I can do to help them, I think I should.    Ms. Conohan: And I know, we talked about it earlier, you're very involved in veteran's activities throughout the county.    Mr. Narozanick: Oh, yes. That's the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the American Legion. Yes.    Ms. Conohan: And just one question that I have from my personal perspective. Through the years I have always been amazed at how remarkable you are with figures. If I have ever asked you any questions with regard to what something costs or whatever, you have it precisely down to the last penny. Do you have some kind of a particular ability to absorb figures and remember this?    Mr. Narozanick: I don't know whether I have that or not, Sherry. But I try to remember everything that happens as far as the County of Monmouth - what our budget is, what we provide, and our indebtedness. I think they are questions I may be asked some time and it's good to have that information. And I try to stick to the figures that are relative to the operation of our county government.    Ms. Conohan: That's terrific. Well, thank you again.    Mr. Narozanick: Thank you, Sherry.
MonmouthCounty;Thomas McMahon;1935;1999;Thomas McMahon, 1935, 1999        Remembering The 20th Century: An Oral History of Monmouth County    Date of Interview: July 18, 1999  Premises of Interview: Mr. McMahon's home, Freehold, NJ  Name of Interviewer: Emily Bershad  Birthdate of subject: December 19, 1935    Ms. Bershad: Tell me a little bit about Monmouth County and specifically Freehold, where you were born.    Mr. McMahon: I was born in Freehold on December 19, 1935, and here is where I have spent my entire life. I remember Freehold fondly from my youth.  It was just a wonderful place to grow up and to see the changes in the world.  I particularly remember when I was young and how it has changed since, as far as the population has grown.  What was farm land and meadows has now become somewhat less, more for the residence, and the area has grown dramatically. When I was a youngster, it was nice to go to farm my grandfather's farm. He used to grow asparagus, potatoes, and corn. He would take all his fruits and vegetables into the Borough of Freehold, behind the American Hotel to the market yard. That is where he, along with his fellow farmers, used to bring their produce to sell them off the wagons.  There were, of course, no shopping malls around. There was just a restaurant here and a restaurant there. One was called Van's, and from what I understand, it was a speakeasy during the 1920s.  It was owned by my sister-in-law’s family.    I remember Freehold being a small town that everyone took a great deal of pride in because it was the county seat. We had two theatres. One was the Strand Theatre, and the other was the Liberty Theatre  both were on Main Street.  When they began, there were no talking movies.  They had an orchestra setup in the Strand Theatre and they had vaudeville acts. When the talkies finally came into play, it was wonderful to see real movies because it only cost you a quarter to do so. What else can I remember?  Well, as I said, I was born in 1935.  I was born in the town of Freehold in the hospital, which is presently an attorney’s office, adjacent to the Freehold Savings and Loan. That was the Hospital of Freehold.    Ms. Bershad: Was it called the Freehold Hospital?    Mr. McMahon: I believe it was.     Ms. Bershad: So you had an orchestra in every theatre.  Tell us about the speakeasy.      James McMahon, Thomas McMahon's father (right) and other relatives  Mr. McMahon: That was Van's.    Ms. Bershad: Was it the same location as it is now?    Mr. McMahon: Yes, it is on Route 79 in Freehold. When you come right down to it, there was only the Colts Neck Inn, as my memory serves me, Van's, and the American Hotel. There were obviously no fast food places. So the times really have changed dramatically over my lifetime here in Monmouth County. My father had a store in Freehold, a men’s clothing store, James A. McMahon’s Men's Clothier. There was a place called Sid Strykers as well.     Ms. Bershad:  Where about was that?    Mr. McMahon: It was right on Main Street, and I remember that during and after the Second World War, it was tough times for a lot of merchants because of the need for the cloth for the soldiers.  The men's wear industry and the women’s wear industry were unable to get much in the way of materials for the clothing, because they were all going to the war effort. Thinking of this, the Second World War was a big thing in the theatres.  They had the war bonds sold and everybody was seeing the patriotic movies at the time.  I also remember air raid tests in school, having to go under the desks for safety.  At home we had to close the curtains and turn off the lights when a siren blew.  It was scary for young children.       Thomas McMahon in a school picture from St. Rose of Lima School in Freehold  Ms. Bershad: Were the schools the same as they are today?    Mr. McMahon:  No.    Ms. Bershad: Vocation wise?    Mr. McMahon:  Yes and no. Saint Rose is where I graduated from, but it was a different school then.  A new school has been put up, I guess probably thirty years ago.  The old building was a small brick one with many outside steps.  It was torn down and now there's a parking lot on McLean Street opposite the church.    Ms. Bershad:  Is the high school in the same location?    Mr. McMahon: Yes, the high school is the same location. We only had one high school at the time, and that was on Route 79.  Matter of fact, my grandfather’s farm was about a mile and a half away, and in those days, there were no houses, just my grandfather’s farmhouse. You could see the high school just looking to the right from his porch.  Part of my youth was spent on his porch looking at the surroundings and the countryside that was absolutely gorgeous.    Ms. Bershad: You were watching the world go by.    Mr. McMahon: Watching the world go by, and it went by very slowly.    Ms. Bershad: Did you walk to school?    Mr. McMahon: Yes, we walked to school almost always.  There were no buses, except for the students from other towns.  Pretty much everybody walked to school, living in the Boro.    Ms. Bershad: I understand that many of the streets in Freehold Borough and also the general Freehold area, which is now Freehold Township, were named after residents.    Mr. McMahon: That’s true, as a matter of fact, one is named Terence Terrace, after my cousin. There is a Ryan Boulevard, which was my grandfather’s name.  My grandmother’s maiden name was Cannon, and there is a Cannon Road. All are in Freehold Township. Another thing that is coming to my mind is the Freehold Racetrack. I  remember in my youth going to the Freehold Raceway often, and it was quite exciting to see the horses.  My sister-in-law Jean Cartwright was a marshal there. She would lead the horses out, and she rode a beautiful horse.  My sister-in-law was a pretty girl, and she was written up in The New York Times at one time showing pictures of her doing just that: leading the horses out.  It was exciting for the family to see her in The New York Times. They eventually changed that to a machine to start the races. Seems like a lot of people from the Freehold area worked at the racetrack and many fond memories were started there.      My father was in business for twenty-seven years.  He started in 1922, and he retired in 1950.  Now I also have a men’s clothing store, presently in Little Silver, NJ, and I have been in business for twenty-eight years. So I did take some inspiration from my father, which I am very happy and very proud of. My father also had a cigar store in Freehold, next to what is now Sweet Lew's Cafe.    Ms. Bershad: Sweet Lew's is a restaurant?    Mr. McMahon: Yes, it is a luncheonette, and it is owned by my son-in-law and my daughter, Keith Lewis and Sandy Lewis. The food there is wonderful!    Ms. Bershad: I certainly believe that, I have been there.  What would you say is your sharpest memory as far as Freehold is concerned?  Is there one thing that stands out in your mind when you think back to when you were young, any event, or something special?    Mr. McMahon: Well, there was a fire in Freehold that destroyed the Strand Theatre. And I happened to be in town at the time, and it took a number of buildings along with it. It was one of the biggest fires that Freehold had in my lifetime, and they never rebuilt the theatre after that. That was next to the county building on Main Street.    Ms. Bershad: The Hall of Records?    Mr. McMahon: The Hall of Records, yes, right next to that. It took the bakery, a shoe store, I believe, and two or three other stores. It took a good bit of the block on Main Street.    Ms. Bershad: And when was this approximately?      Mr. McMahon: In the late 1950s.    Ms. Bershad: Well, that was very interesting. Thank you so much for sharing your memories.     
MonmouthCounty;Stephen Higgins;1953;2000;Stephen Higgins, 1953, 2000        Remembering The 20th Century: An Oral History of Monmouth County      Stephen Higgins  Date of Interview: June 1, 2000  Name of Interviewer: Flora Higgins  Premises of Interview: Barcelona, Spain  Birthdate of Subject: May 28, 1953    Ms. Higgins: Good afternoon, Stephen.     Mr. Higgins: Hi, Mom.    Ms. Higgins: What are you first memories of growing up in Monmouth County?      Stephen on his bicycle  Mr. Higgins: Lone Oak Road, Waterman's field. The Mateys and the Mahoneys and the Cumings and the Sonnenfelds and the Fullertons. My first memories are of my dad  pushing me down the street on a bicycle and the street didn't have pavement. It just had round stones stuck in the street with tar. That was great, because later we used to take his car out from between the stones. There was an apple orchard at the end of the turnaround. That was great because I used to go with Freddie Sonnenfeld, who is three or four years older than me, and he used to have a kite that would do loops and all this stuff. We used to fly it around the apple trees. We used to climb the apple trees and pick the apples. Nobody was harvesting them. I guess the land had already been sold to the development to come. We used to hang out with the Moores a lot too. They owned the last  farm in Monmouth County  it seemed to me at the time.    Ms. Higgins: Did you start school there when you lived there?     Mr. Higgins: I went to Harmony one year. One year I went to another school.     Ms. Higgins: Schools were getting crowded in Monmouth County in the 1950s and there were split sessions because Monmouth County was growing so rapidly. Do you remember anything about there being a lot of children in the schools?    Mr. Higgins: Oh, we had a great time. Of course, we had hall patrols of kids. In the schools, we use to form all kinds of gangs to play. I remember we had one big gang. We really didn't do much of anything, except hang out and wonder what to do. (Laughs) Or go to the creek across the other side of Brigadoon and wander around the marshes -- and up in the very end, after they tore down apple orchard to make a new development. At the very, very end of that development of a park. Was it Harmony Park? I think. At that time, I was starting to fly model airplanes inspired by Sean Moore, who had quite a few of those. In back of that park was a jungle that went forever. That jungle went all the way to Louie's Bar, on Route 35.The road followed it all the way up where it curved over to the right to that kind of a park at the very end, the Plaza Park, where there is a ball field and basketball hoop. And we used to try and fly model airplanes there. But the jungle behind was so impenetrable that nobody had ever made it to Louie's Bar. Because it  was an impenetrable swamp. It was so big and so long. You would go back there until your feet were wet and you were full of mud and knew your mom was going to kill you when you got home. But you never made it out to Route 35. Never. Ever and ever. It was impossible. I don't how if anybody ever did make it. Or if they had to use a bulldozer to open a path in an African jungle technique.    Ms. Higgins: Maybe it's still there.    Mr. Higgins: It could still be there. (Laugh)    Ms. Higgins: What were your mothers doing?    Mr. Higgins: Really I don't know. I wasn't there. I guessed they were worrying about us. (Laughs) Sometimes I wonder how my parents let me go to such extremes. Now I'm a parent and I watch my kids. And I think every minute when I was twelve years old, I was going fifty miles away from home. Kid's life for me and then I would go home.  (Laughs)    Ms. Higgins: Someone I interviewed just the other day  said, "The children were free. From the time they were about three, we'd say, 'Go out and play.' They went out the door and went out and played." That certainly isn't the way it is in Monmouth County anymore. On another subject, Monmouth County is known for its seashores. Do you remember much about  the seashore?       Stephen Higgins with brother, Ted, at the beach  Mr. Higgins: It seems in the summer there were about two or three or four or five days a week we went to the beach. In whatever car that was... what was it? Some kind of.... I can't remember. I remember one time, I tried to start it up in the garage. Do you remember anything about that?    Ms. Higgins: No. Thank God.    Mr. Higgins: Maybe it was dream. Maybe it was a dream, but I remember being in the garage and trying to start a car. The keys were in the ignition -- nobody ever took the keys -- and the motor was turning over. And I remember you coming and starting to scream at me, "Get out of the car. What are you doing in the car?" And the motor was turning over and I had no idea how to put in drive or anything like that.    Ms. Higgins: That's a good thing. Probably would have driven off to the beach. (Laughs)    Mr. Higgins: When we lived in the development o n Lone Oak Road, I used to mix up soap powders and bleach and strange things and set them on fire, trying to make great chemical reactions. I remember drying oak leaves to make cigarettes with Claire. You have to remember that, over the barbecue in the back. Remember we had the barbecue on a couple of cinder blocks and a grill that was in the backyard there with that circular thing. It used to be the case thing that you put kids in. Eventually when we grew up, we rolled it up and made a fort out of it.    Ms. Higgins: Do you remember the Heath family?     Mr. Higgins: Yes. Billy and I used to explore the impenetrable forest. His house was on the other side. You could get to his house from that park. (Was that Memorial Park, Harmony Park?) There were pine woods, and you could pass that way. But the way out to Route 35 was just too much. Yes, we use to make forts in the woods. I saw him seven years ago or so. I was having a beer in The Cove, a bar there, and he came in. I didn't recognize him at first.    Ms. Higgins: Tell us about some of the other friends you made there in Middletown. Did you have friends you watched TV with or went bike riding with?    Mr. Higgins: All of them.    Ms. Higgins: Was Mickey Mouse Club the big thing then?    Mr. Higgins: Yes. We had just gotten the television. I remember The Crawling Eye. (Laugh) The Crawling Eye: what a great movie.  I was so terrified that I had to turn off the television    Ms. Higgins: How long did you live in Lone Oak Road in Middletown?    Mr. Higgins: I started the fifth grade in Highlands at the Highlands Elementary School. That was fun. I meet a whole bunch of different people there. Who did I meet at first? Let's see: Mr. Espenshade, he was pretty good. I wonder what he is doing now?    Ms. Higgins: Did they have a music program there in the Highlands?       Stephen Higgins in 1965 when he began playing clarinet  Mr. Higgins: That's when I began to play the clarinet. Some guy came and went on the stage with all the instruments. He played a clarinet, he played a saxophone, and he  played a trumpet and a violin. He was some kind of salesman. He wanted everybody to sign up to play instruments. He would rent them the instruments. Everybody could get in line and if they wanted to pick an instrument. And then they had a music teacher in school, and we started to play music. Maybe that was in Lone Oak I started to play  I can't remember which school it was where I was introduced to the instruments. I think it was in Harmony School because I remember Roger Baker there. I picked up the clarinet and he picked clarinet also. But he changed to the saxophone pretty quickly. His dad was a saxophone player. I see him every once in a while. He was playing saxophone. He was really talented.    Ms. Higgins: Do you still play the clarinet or the sax?    Mr. Higgins: Rarely, if ever, either one. I was trying to help some beginning sax players the other day. We went down with some guitar players and a bass player and two of these guys who had only played the saxophone for a couple of years. But they are really dedicated. One guy is about  thirty and the other guy is about twenty-two or twenty-three. I haven't played for a long time, but I really got to show him some tricks.    Ms. Higgins: Tell us about when your school went up to the World's Fair.      Stephen Higgins and classmates at the World Fair  Mr. Higgins: Oh, when I got lost. Well, I played the clarinet solo "Maria" in the New Jersey Pavilion on one day. Then we went another day and somehow I got lost. I was  walking along with my teacher, talking to her very, very animated. I was very animated.  "This and that, blah blah blah blah," and I finally looked up and this lady I had never seen before in my life was looking down at me. And I said, "Where's my teacher?" And I looked around and there was nobody I knew anywhere within a thousand miles. What happened here?    Ms. Higgins: How did you get home?    Mr. Higgins: I went to my grandparents' house. Well, after finally looking for my group and not finding them. And talking to the police. And they said, "Here is a lost kid," and really I don't know how they got my grandparents' phone number. Did they talk to you guys?    Ms. Higgins: Eventually.    Mr. Higgins: I think I gave the police my grandparents' name. And I think I had known the address because I had been there several times. So then I went and got together with them. Everyone was very mad at me. I don't know why. They said I got lost on purpose to go see my grandparents. Really, all my friends said "You did it on purpose to go see your grandparents."    Ms. Higgins: Do you remember how you got to the World's Fair that day?    Mr. Higgins: On the City of Keansburg. That was a ferry boat. It wasn't a very big ferry. You could put maybe fifteen cars on there. I remember going to get on and going in the line to get on.   It was green and white  It was pretty neat, actually. The pier is long gone.    Ms. Higgins: After the Highlands Elementary School, where did you go the high school?    Mr. Higgins:   I went to Henry Hudson Regional High School from the seventh grade on.    Ms. Higgins: That was a pretty new school at the time, wasn't it?    Mr. Higgins: I was in the second or third seventh grade class.    Ms. Higgins: What are you most outstanding memories of Henry Hudson Regional High School?      Stephen Higgins in a school production of Oklahoma, 1969  Mr. Higgins: Mom, could I not answer that question? (laughs). What are my  memories of Henry Hudson? (Lots of laughter) Well, being in Oklahoma. That was a big part.    Ms. Higgins:  Who directed that?    Mr. Higgins: Bob Waldron,  who was really a great guy. I played Curly. Yeah, he gave me the lead, even though I was only a sophomore.  I didn't do too bad either.    Ms. Higgins: Henry Hudson was also known for its gymnastic team. Did you do gymnastics?    Mr. Higgins: Yeah, I did some gymnastics with the team and practiced every night. But I never competed with them. I never got to the high school team. I was seventh and eighth grade. By the time high school came we were all hippies. School didn't matter any more.    Ms. Higgins: What were you doing?    Mr. Higgins: Oh, everything imaginable that hippies did. Playing the guitar. Playing hookey. Drinking beer. Smoking whatever substances happened to be handy. There was a semi lost sort of an ethic in those days. Everybody started to go crazy.    Ms. Higgins: You mentioned the music scene, was that about the time Bruce Springsteen got started?    Mr. Higgins: We went to a few concerts of his before he was ever known or famous or anything. Kyle was one group of musicians. Steel Mill used to play at Clearwater pool and they were really good.    Ms. Higgins: Did Bruce Springsteen ever play at Clearwater Pool?    Mr. Higgins: Two times.    Ms. Higgins: Two times and you all knew he was good?    Mr. Higgins: Well, you didn't have to know he was good. He was already like the Monmouth County legend at the time. But he did some really, really good stuff. Probably better than what he is doing now.    Ms. Higgins: Really!    Mr. Higgins: Now he is so commercial and tired and he's getting to where he doesn't have the same enthusiasm as he did. But I went to two concerts of his that were really, really, really good. Really good. Clearwater Pool, when Tinker was his soundman and the most modern Phil Stokes had was a round button to look at the sound (laughs).    Ms. Higgins: And he played his own stuff?    Mr. Higgins: Yes.    Ms. Higgins: Did you hear any of his own stuff that got to be famous later?    Mr. Higgins: I really couldn't remember.    Ms. Higgins: Did you play any places yourself?      Stephen Higgins, second from right, 1969  Mr. Higgins: Sometimes, I used to play at The Trolley. They had three  places where we could just get up and play. People would take turns. What's the name of the place in Red Bank? The very end of Main Street where it ends at Kislins. It was called something like the Trolley Stop. Then it was JTs. It traded owners a lot of times. There were three stages. We used to play there a lot. And where else? We played at Clearwater Pool for some high school dances with Jerry Dragon and Tommy McCaffrey. Tom McCaffrey is another guy I would like to see. Oh, I remember playing for a dance at the Rumson Country Club with Tom and Jerry and Roland Krueger. Was that encouraging!    Ms. Higgins: Stephen, was there any sort of rituals or rites of passage that adolescents had to do in Highlands?    Mr. Higgins: No, not really.    Ms. Higgins: Someone from Highlands the other day was telling me about teenagers jumping off the bridge.    Mr. Higgins: Yeah, but that wasn't a rite of passage, that was just something to do on the weekends. There was one guy, I think his name was Jim Perry. I think he is finally is dead. He was in jail for a long time for killing someone. I think he got murdered himself. This was a really weird guy. But you know he wasn't a dumb weird guy. He was kind of an all right sort of weird guy. And it didn't end up that he did those things because he was so bad. It was just kind of his life. But he hung on to that bridge when it was opening one time. A sailboat was going by and he was hanging on the part underneath. And the bridge opened up all the way and he was all the way up there hanging on. And he couldn't let go, because the sailboat was going under him.  But finally he hung on long enough and the sailboat went past and he let go. And that was the biggest dive of all the history of Highlands, I would have to say.    Ms. Higgins: That must have been quite a jump.    Mr. Higgins: That guy was out of his mind. I mean really totally out of his mind. Some of these people are totally crazy.    Ms. Higgins: Did you go surfing?    Mr. Higgins: Whenever I could. We could spend weeks on ends at the beach without even coming home sometimes all weekend. Going to fish for striped bass all weekend, sometimes with those two Black guys. What was that one guy's name? Fred, Fishing Fred, who came and drank with my dad when he brought us home. We used to go fishing with him. (laughs)    Ms. Higgins: Did you ever catch anything?    Mr. Higgins: Well, they did. (laughs) My brother Ted and I would go on Friday night and come home Sunday.    Ms. Higgins: Yes, we trusted you with Fishing Fred.    Mr. Higgins: He was all right. He was all right. He was a pretty neat guy. He had a station wagon, but he used to say, "This is my fishing car  I usually drive around in a Mack truck." I guess that was his job or something.  He was truck driver.    Ms. Higgins: Did you fish inland?    Mr. Higgins: Yes, with The Great Arnie.  He was good. He was good. He introduced Ted and me to molded catfish bait. And how to make rocks and twigs and bait and things disappear in your bare hands. He would bait a hook and then there would be no hook or anything.     Ms. Higgins: There's a big tower out there at Atlantic Highlands and I heard that some teenagers during that era tried to get on top of it.    Mr. Higgins: Tried? I've been there a few times.    Ms. Higgins: Not to the top of the big tower!?    Mr. Higgins: To the very top. And you know those red lights that they have on the very top? I climbed the mast and touched the light on the very, very top. They have to change the light bulbs there, so there has to be a way up. I've been there.    Ms. Higgins: Why?    Mr. Higgins: Because it was there. (laughter)    Ms. Higgins: Amazing.    Mr. Higgins: Oh, we had parties at the base of that tower. (laughter) I remember one time we were going up that tower with Mickey and... who was Mickey's friend? He was a lot better guy than Mickey. Who else? Jerry and Penny were with us. We started to go up and those guys down there were throwing snowballs at us. And we are climbing up this little ladder and they are throwing these big snowballs. But after a while they were smaller snowballs. After awhile the snowballs were hitting behind your feet. And after awhile you could see those guys and they were still throwing snowballs. Going like brink, clink, brink......It takes a long time to climb that tower. It takes a long time to get up there. That thing has to be three hundred feet high. You go past the equipment, all these gears and microwaves, stingers and stuff that they have. You can hear it go bbbsssswwweeee. (laughter)      Stephen Higgins and Betty Jo on Prom Evening, 1969  Ms. Higgins: Stephen, tell us about proms back there in the 1970s.    Mr. Higgins: The only prom I ever went to was to Betty Jo Timmer's prom. I would love to see Betty Jo. She was one of the good guys.    Ms. Higgins: Was your family involved in the education system there in Highlands?    Mr. Higgins: My dad was President of the Board for some years. I'm sure I caused him some embarrassment.  I remember my youth. What do you know? (Laughs)  I wasn't exactly a star student and I was known to be sort of a cut-up. And I hung around with the basically wrong crowd. Well I don't know if they were wrong, but they  certainly were different. Anyway, I'm sure that was kind of tough for Dad at times. Especially when we lifted all the speakers from the outside of the school for our rock group.    Ms. Higgins: Excuse me. You did what?     Mr. Higgins: There were speakers outside the school to make announcements about fire drills and stuff like that. Big orange speakers.    Ms. Higgins: And you took them?    Mr. Higgins: Yes. One night, we went and stole them all to use them for our rock group, because we didn't have speakers. We didn't have a dime to buy speakers. And then, my good friend the principal, Harold Schiable, called me down to the office. I don't know how he had any idea that I had anything to do with the theft of the speakers. But he said, "Stephen, we know you did it." And I don't think he really knew we did it. But I'm such a pushover that under pressure, under the hot lights, I cave in. I said, "Okay, they will be back." So we brought them all back and nobody said anything. I don't know how he knew that. How did he know that? Maybe because we were really the only guitar players in the whole school who would want speakers. Mr. Schiable wasn't bad.    Ms. Higgins: Tell us about some of the other teachers.    Mr. Higgins: Oh, they were a lot of fun. But the best was one was Mr. Cherry. What can you say about Mr. Cherry? I liked Mr. Cherry a lot. He was our shop teacher. He use to prowl around in corners and stuff and try and catch people smoking. And one time I almost got suspended because I figured, "I'm gonna draw this guy out." I went behind the mobile classroom. We had so many students at the time that we had twelve mobile classrooms. They were like trailers.  I was outside and doing my hand like this, because everybody did their hands like this with a cigarette. I just went out back of the mobile trailer and going like this. "I caught you", he said. I said, "No, look." And he said, "What are you, a magician?" And he smelled my breath and everything. And after awhile he realized that I was just kind of fooling with him. He was a nice guy. Mr. Cherry was a nice guy. And Mr. Levadusky  --he was my other shop teacher -- was also a good guy.    Ms. Higgins: How about your English teachers?    Mr. Higgins: I remember my English teacher, Mr. Christopher. He was like the cop in class. You could never imagine him doing drugs, but he really did . It's just hard to believe, because he was like the big narc. I remember him and Jerry Dragon one time got into...Cause this was in the 1960s and everybody thought Christopher was a narc. We thought he was looking in our lockers. Maybe he was looking in our lockers for drugs. I don't know  we thought he was a cop. We thought he was like the nastiest narco squad guy around. To find out later that he himself was messing around with all that stuff was a shock... anyway.    Mr. Higgins:  The hours we spent in the library were very few. What I remember about the library was it was big. They had a lot of good books and we planted pot seeds in the rubber tree. And they started to grow.    Ms. Higgins: Did they come up? Tell us about the police force there in the Highlands. Was there some kind of stoppage at the school?  What was that called? A strike?     Mr. Higgins: No, that was a gang fight. That was all organized by David Butler.     Ms. Higgins: Tell us about that.    Mr. Higgins: David Butler had a lot of influence at that school at one time. He was the most twisted genius, a weirdo, a kind of strange person: something between normal people and the subhuman. What was going on then? I don't even remember, because I wasn't even a part of it. What was going on?  I don't know who there was, but a lot of kids showed up on the corner with things like table legs and chains. And it wasn't anything to do with the school. Somebody stole something from somebody and that whole group of people then was branded as subhuman. It was like the Eugene Mitchell, Steve Monollee, Gary Wallcots,  I don't remember all of them. Anyway, somebody at the school saw us all there,  yelling and screaming with weapons. And they sent for the police, and they said, "Go home or we'll make Penn State look like a Sunday school picnic." It was great. (laughter). I wasn't close to all the action at that time. I was kind of like, "I'll be a bystander here." That's cool.    Ms. Higgins:Thank you, Stephen for sharing these memories of growing up in Monmouth County during the middle part of the 20th Century. It has been very interesting!    Mr. Higgins:Thank you for including me in your oral history program. I enjoyed speaking with you.
MonmouthCounty;Stanley W. (Pete) Orr;1937;1999;Stanley W. (Pete) Orr, 1937, 1999        Remembering the 20th Century: An Oral History of Monmouth County     Date of Interview:  July 22,1999  Name of Interviewer:  Flora Higgins  Premises of Interviewer:  Mrs. Donowitz's home, Manalapan, NJ  Birth date of subject:  July 29, 1937    Ms. Higgins: Tell me Mr. Orr, what did your people do many years ago when they first came to Monmouth County?    Mr. Orr: They've always been farmers.    Ms. Higgins: Any particular kind of farming?    Mr. Orr: Originally they lived over on what is now McCaffery Road and back in there, they grew blackberries. Then, my grandfather came over here in 1903, and they grew potatoes.    Ms. Higgins: Oh, I have some experience with blackberry bushes myself. They are very labor intensive to pick, aren't they?    Mr. Orr: They're a hot itchy job.    Ms. Higgins: And you can't not wear long sleeves cause you'd get all scratched up. Where did you market them? Were they marketed locally?      Peter Orr's father and grandfather, Stanley and Tom, planting potatoes in 1939  Mr. Orr: I honestly don't know where they marketed them.  There used to be a lot of buyers and dealers in the area for the potatoes.  Most of the stuff that Grandpop and Pop grew went over to Reed and Perrine.    Ms. Higgins: When they went on that trip, did they take trucks?    Mr. Orr: Trucks.  The major difference was they used to have potato graders right at the railroad siding, and they graded the potatoes as they loaded 'em.    Ms. Higgins: By size?    Mr. Orr: Yes. Picked the rotten ones out and sized 'em, and so forth.    Ms. Higgins: Was farming in New Jersey a very big industry?    Mr. Orr: Yes.  Especially around here, when I was a kid, it was all potatoes.  My wife's grandfather was Howard Jones.  Down there they had a place called Jones Siding, and they named it Jones Siding because he loaded so many potatoes there.    Ms. Higgins: Remember, a few years ago, a big potato farm in Colts Neck, probably the last big potato farm, was sold to a developer.    Mr. Orr: Yes.  The Flocks had lots of potatoes and then they had quite a large dairy.  I don't know if there are any dairy farms left in the county. The last one was up in Upper Freehold.    Ms. Higgins: Upper Freehold is something like going back in time, isn't it? How did you meet your wife?    Mr. Orr: At the Grange.    Ms. Higgins: At the Grange. Which one? The Atlantic Grange?    Mr. Orr: Atlantic Grange.    Ms. Higgins: In Colts Neck.  That is where the library is now.  Oh, my goodness.  She was from a farmer's family and you were farmers. So you went to meetings there?    Mr. Orr: Yes.  The Grange wasn't limited to farmers.  Her father was in the insurance business, and her grandfather was an insurance broker.    Ms. Higgins: So the Grange building was used for various meetings? That must have been a pretty good building.    Mr. Orr: Well, it was a good organization. Her grandfather built that area. He retired from Martins.     Ms. Higgins: In the 1940s?    Mr. Orr: No, later than that, probably in the late 1950s or 1960s.    Ms. Higgins: I know that building well. I used to be the librarian there. I always hoped it would be a historical library.    Mr. Orr: But I belonged to the Grange down here where the West Monmouth Church is.    Ms. Higgins: And is the Grange still active?    Mr. Orr: No, the Grange is gone away like a lot of things. No, I guess, there are still a few Grange members left in the extreme North and South Jersey.    Ms. Higgins: But was it an active part of your life when your family was farming?    Mr. Orr: Yes.    Ms. Higgins: What kind of things happened at the Grange?    Mr. Orr: It was mainly social, but also to lobby for farmers.  In other words, they could lobby the lawmakers and so forth. Because you attend the Grange and the Farm Bureau, you know the farmers could have an influence.  I think how like they had their first hearing on this new Route 33 and they talked about that for probably years and years and years. Their first hearing of it, too, was held at the Grange.    Ms. Higgins: Was it like a union for the farmers?    Mr. Orr: No, it was a family social organization.    Ms. Higgins: Would they get together and mention to the politicians and maybe run their own candidate?    Mr. Orr: Because of having a large membership, they were able to lobby political leaders and so forth.    Ms. Higgins: Can you tell me about an average day at a busy farm?    Mr. Orr: Well, we never had any animals. It was strictly crops and you would basically depend on the weather in the springtime. What I recall my father and uncle doing is a lot of what you call custom work. That's where one local farmer works for another farmer and they would take their equipment around. More like the people do then, was the beginning of farming and they had a lot of tomato plants. Most farmers didn't because of it being a large investment, most farmers didn't go for it. They had a high speed planter (if there is such a thing) and a couple of tank trucks and pumps. They'd go around and pump, farm to farm, and plant the plants for them.    Ms. Higgins: Did they can tomatoes right there? Process them?    Mr. Orr: No, the tomatoes we planted, the majority of them went to the Campbell Soup Company.  We had a few go to Stokes, which used to have a plant inside Vincentown. And there were some farmers around here that went to Stokley's in Trenton.  And there was a canning house in... I don't remember that name...Foster's, I think it was.  Custom work would be to accommodate the fact that each farmer didn't have to duplicate so much machinery. In other words, one farmer would have the combine, and in order to make it pay for him, along with doing his own, he would do other peoples' work, too.    Ms. Higgins: That sounds like a very profitable way to run it.    Mr. Orr: It was done so that each farmer didn't have to own a piece of equipment that you might only use for one day a year.    Ms. Higgins: I understand. Now, what would happen when everything would come in at once?     Mr. Orr: You worked around the clock.    Ms. Higgins: Did you get extra help in?    Mr. Orr: Yes.  We had a crew of about between twenty and forty. These they called migrant helpers. They picked potatoes and tomatoes.    Ms. Higgins: Were they legal?    Mr. Orr: Yes.  They worked the seasons. In other words, they worked picking string beans and I think around upstate Florida. Then come up and get another crop in the Carolinas. They would come up and pick the crop throughout Virginia. They would arrive here in, let's say, the first of August, and they would be here from the first of August until the first of November sometime, and then they would go back to Florida and start the loop over again. The apple farmers had apple pickers the same way and they used to call them crews. Like the crew we that had lived here, they also picked and handled Oliver Clayton's crop.      Stanley M. Orr (left) and Bill Clayton on tractors  Ms. Higgins: What did he grow?    Mr. Orr: Potatoes. And a lot of time they worked together with crews from Marlboro. Then that got to be, as things changed, the last couple of years we had tomatoes, we got what they call "day help."  What would happen was there would be a bus to go down to a pick up point somewhere, then you pick them up. But, they became a problem because they put the day help with the help that we had for years and they just spoiled it, because they wanted to be paid off everyday and it was just a big party for them.    Ms. Higgins: What did they do when they weren't picking?    Mr. Orr: Drinking.    Ms. Higgins: Oh.  But I mean, in the winter?    Mr. Orr: They drank part of the pay they got.    Ms. Higgins: Farming is just so labor intensive, isn't it?    Mr. Orr: Oh, that is why you don't see any big extensive crops around here now. All your labor helpers moved to California and they had machine work. There are still a few Mexicans out there that are doing to work.    Ms. Higgins: Now all the laborers are "you pick."    Mr. Orr: Yes.    Ms. Higgins: You pick strawberries, you pick blueberries.    Mr. Orr: They had to start "you pick," because you couldn't get pickers.    Ms. Higgins: When did "you-pick" start?    Mr. Orr: Probably thirty years ago.    Ms. Higgins: And that was around when the people had left the farms?    Mr. Orr: It just evolved as there became more money in the economy.  There were less people to do that type of work.    Ms. Higgins: Did you leave the farm due to the Depression, or did your family farm here through the Depression?    Mr. Orr: Yes, yes definitely.    Ms. Higgins: That must have been hard.    Mr. Orr: Yes and no.  I tell you it was hard, but the farmer was not hit as hard as the people who lost all their money. There were several banks and the associated businesses.     Ms. Higgins: Were they able to pay their mortgages and stay on the land?    Mr. Orr: Oh, yes.  And at the time when I was a kid, they did a lot of what is called farming on shares. That's when a property owner would pay for the seeds and fertilizer in return for a percentage of their crop. Some of them are renting farms now. They didn't have the where-with-all to do that then. So they did what they called farming on shares and maybe you made about half of the crop. All the farmer did was put in the labor.    Ms. Higgins: And this was negotiable?    Mr. Orr: Yes.    Ms. Higgins: And that's another fairly sensible solution to a problem. It's not like tenant farming.    Mr. Orr: No.  Potatoes are a very expensive crop. That's basically why there's not any grown around here now, because now the price is got to be out of this world.  But very few people willing to do the work had the money to handle a crop. Dealers, they used to own a lot of ground, the same as when Frances and Saul (Donowitz) were in the chicken business. And the nearest big major feed companies owned a lot of chicken farms. The same idea.    Ms. Higgins: When the farmers would make political overtures, suggestions, and requests, what kind of things did they ask for?    Mr. Orr: They got a request that is still around today. The license plates on farm trucks, you see they say "farmer."  They got the license plates for moving from farm to farm at a reduced rate.  I think the Farm Bureau was a leader in getting the farm land assessment that we have today. Because without farmland assessment, there would be absolutely no farms left here.    Ms. Higgins: They are picking away at that legislation too, and I would hate to see that not be.    Mr. Orr: It is a double-edged sword because, today, only a few real farmers own their own land. Most of the land is owned by investors, speculators, and so forth.  They couldn't afford to own land without farmland assessment.    Ms. Higgins: What were some of the medical practices when you were growing up?    Mr. Orr:  We went to the Doc Woodruff over at Englishtown.    Ms. Higgins: Woodruff?    Mr. Orr: Yes.  The nearest hospital at that time was Neptune.    Ms. Higgins: Neptune. No Riverview. Of course, no CentraState.    Mr. Orr: No, Riverview started later but it started long before Freehold CentraState. And I personally worked the farmland where CentraState is. That wasan old farm.    Ms. Higgins: Can you remember any fads or trends that came and went?  When the War came, did that change a lot of the way people did things?    Mr. Orr: Basically, it made the automobile market good. The War really created a better market for the farmers because they had to feed their troops and there was a deferment policy for young guys on the farm.  They were more valuable on the farm than in the military so there was a deferment.  The potato was a mainstay.    Ms. Higgins: Can you describe any childhood games or things that you remember your parents doing or talking about or?    Mr. Orr: There's not much difference there, you know, except we used to play down in the yard. The biggest difference is at that time, the whole family did the business. In other words, you lived on the farm that was your topic of conversation.    Ms. Higgins: What would you think if farming was to go back the way it was?  For example, sometimes you hear people talking about organic farming and not using tractors, is this possible?    Mr. Orr: I've never done that, but it's possible.  Farmers would love organic farming, as they wouldn't have to buy those expensive chemicals, but you always need a chemical because potatoes are not normal to this area. So, that is why you get so many problems.  It is not natural to grow potatoes like they are. So you have to treat the ground in order to do it.    Ms. Higgins: My farmer friends say farming starts in the dirt.    Mr. Orr: Because for any intense farming like potatoes and your orchards, and so on, and any of your crops, tomatoes, corn, and like that, you have to take care of your land or you're not going to have next year to work with.    Ms. Higgins: Did you rotate crops?    Mr. Orr: Yes.    Ms. Higgins: Mr. Orr do you think people were happier when the days were so much quieter and we didn't have all this rushing around in cars and things like that?    Mr. Orr: I don't think they're any happier or less happy.    Ms. Higgins: So many people complain to me that they are so rushed today.    Mr. Orr: People got to do what they have to do with the time they have to do them. I never recall not being rushed because you had to rush to get your work done.    Ms. Higgins: Even in the winter?    Mr. Orr: No, but in the winter, even then most people would find other things to do.  Many farmers would work for a couple or three or four months as carpenters.  That's time my uncle got started in the car business. He worked with a mechanic.    Ms. Higgins: Oh, and then he left farming and was a full-time car dealer?    Mr. Orr: Yes.    Ms. Higgins: Did your people come from Ireland or somewhere where they liked to grow potatoes, and they knew potatoes?    Mr. Orr: No, just because it was the most profitable crop around here at the time.  One Grandpop came from Scotland. One Grandmomma came from Ireland, and I think, I don't know where all of them came from, other than we just a mishmash.    Ms. Higgins: Like most Americans, myself included.  Is there any story or background about Monmouth County that you would like to share to people who will be listening to this or reading this interview in the middle of the 21st Century? If you were to say why Monmouth County is special, what would you say?    Mr. Orr: Monmouth County used to be the leading garden county in the nation.  I think it was even more than Lancaster County in Pennsylvania. But ground is just plain too valuable to farm, and that is why it is somewhat more valuable to develop it than farm it.    Ms. Higgins: With the proximity to the cities, the people would just rather move here.    Mr. Orr: People had the money and they wanted to get out of the cities and live in the suburban area, and land is just plain too valuable to farm. And the pressure to get the farmers out of there is intense.  It's kind of an economical thing.    Ms. Higgins: What about the horse farms?  They seemed to come out a little better.    Mr. Orr: Because a lot of it is recreational and because people are willing to spend money that they earn somewhere else.  They don't have to make a living off their horses. I'm not saying all of them, but a lot of them.    Ms. Higgins: What do you think are the personal strengths that your family had that enabled them to keep farming and working so hard like that?    Mr. Orr: They didn't know what else to do.    Ms. Higgins: They were farmers, Monmouth County farmers.  We are the Garden State. Was Monmouth the most intensely farmed county in the Garden State?    Mr. Orr: At one time. There's much more farming done now down in extreme south Jersey.     Ms. Higgins: Burlington, Camden?    Mr. Orr: Oh, way on down.    Ms. Higgins: Atlantic?    Mr. Orr: Salem County too.  Most of the farmers who I knew from around here who wanted to remain in farming have gone to either Salem County or Delaware  lots of them have gone to Chester County in Maryland and they just keep one step ahead of the developers.    Ms. Higgins: When you had the potato crop, did you use a lot of the potatoes yourself, or did you never want to see a potato by the time you got it in?    Mr. Orr: No, it really wasn't too much.  I recall at the end of the time, there being a bunch of potato harvesters, where they didn't pick by hand, you know where they handled them by bulk with the Harvestor, instead of digging them and picking them up. And really, other than being a long dusty day, it wasn't that bad.    Ms. Higgins: And you supported yourself and your family, raised children and supported yourselves doing nothing but potato farming until when?    Mr. Orr: Well, I left farm before I got married, because you couldn't make a living. It is a funny thing.    Ms. Higgins: Even after the War when the economy was still expanding, I guess it was expanding into houses then.    Mr. Orr: The farmers faced a different economy. Their economy was probably better during the War than right after it. The only thing about it was you couldn't buy the equipment during the War and so they purchased a lot of equipment right after the War in the late 40s and early 50s.    Ms. Higgins: They probably got into debt, too, what with the tractors and combines and harvesters.    Mr. Orr: Yes.  And if the average farmer had one good year out of seven or eight, he was doing pretty good.    Ms. Higgins: Really!  Of course, you couldn't do much about the weather any more than we can now.    Mr. Orr: No.  Funny thing, because when the weather's good, the price is bad, and when the price is good, the weather's bad. That's just the way it is.    Ms. Higgins: When you were growing up, who were the heroes for the people in Monmouth County?    Mr. Orr: I can't think of anyone special.    Ms. Higgins: Did you ever get to the seashore?    Mr. Orr: Once in awhile, but even when I was a kid, it was too crowded for me.    Ms. Higgins: Where did you go?    Mr. Orr: Manasquan.    Ms. Higgins: And Manasquan was too crowded for you?    Mr. Orr: Yes.    Ms. Higgins: What did you end up doing when you left the farm?    Mr. Orr: Working on trucks.  I became a truck mechanic.    Ms. Higgins: So, you became a mechanic also. I guess experience working with tractors and all of that farm machinery helped you.    Mr. Orr: You know, farming was a business for most people. And we tried to make a buck, same as any other business    Ms. Higgins: Where are potatoes grown now?  I hear Long Island doesn't do much with the potato anymore, either.    Mr. Orr: They still grow a lot out West, in Idaho and Maine. They grow some up in Maine and northern parts. 'Cause the potato's natural environment is in the high grounds.    Ms. Higgins: I never would have known that.  All the potato farmland you usually see is flat, flat, flat.    Mr. Orr: Yes. You usually got a good crop here, but the normal environment, they just grow at a higher elevation.  We used to get seed potatoes from Maine and New England, and Prince Edward Island, and all up in that area. There were people who had made a living bringing them down on trucks.    Ms. Higgins: It must have been pretty expensive too, that's a lot of gas.    Mr. Orr: You had to get the proper seed potato. They had to grow in the cold weather. Cool weather.    Ms. Higgins: That is certainly not Monmouth County. Is there anything that you would like to say to the people of the future about the past in Monmouth County?    Mr. Orr: You just have to go with the flow. My father's name was Stanley Orr and every body call him Plugger and I was Pete. A lot of people that don't know me as anything but Pete.    Ms. Higgins: Thanks very much, Mr. Orr.    
MonmouthCounty;Sol Libsohn;1914;2000;Sol Libsohn, 1914, 2000        Remembering The 20th Century: An Oral History of Monmouth County      Sol Libsohn, Roosevelt New Jersey. Photograph taken by Gary Saretzky,   January 28, 2000  Date of Interview: January 28, 2000  Name of Interviewer: Gary Saretzky  Premises of Interview: Mr. Libsohn's home, Roosevelt, NJ  Birthdate of Subject: February 5, 1914  Deceased: January 21, 2001    Mr. Libsohn: Well, it's kind of interesting to have reached this point.    Mr. Saretzky: You've lived through much of the century and you must have seen a great many interesting things and met many interesting people during your lifetime. Can I ask you where you were born?    Mr. Libsohn: I was born in Harlem, New York City.    Mr. Saretzky: Tell me a little bit about your family.    Mr. Libsohn: They were immigrants from Poland, Russia. Poland belonged to Russia at the time. They were both looking for a new life and I guess I came with it.    Mr. Saretzky: You were born after they arrived here?    Mr. Libsohn: Right.    Mr. Saretzky: And they came together?    Mr. Libsohn: They came together, yes.    Mr. Saretzky: And how long had they been here before you were born?    Mr. Libsohn: Maybe a year or two.    Mr. Saretzky: Did your parents find work when they came to America?    Mr. Libsohn: My father was a leather worker and neither of them were educated in Europe but I always remembered my mother going to school constantly here to try to learn more about the U.S.A. My father knew how to speak English. My mother always spoke with an accent. My father never had an accent, as far as I can remember.    Mr. Saretzky: Do you think he knew English before he came here?    Mr. Libsohn: I doubt it. Neither of them went to school but they always had books in the house. I remember growing up underneath an oak leaf table with lion's feet on it or some kind of either lion's or tiger's paws.    Mr. Saretzky: Was that one of your earliest memories, eating under the table?    Mr. Libsohn: Yes, and there's a very funny story about that. I grew up mainly in the Bronx. My mother had a brother who had gone to Montreal. He invited my mother up there with me but I don't remember that at all. I must have been an infant then.    Mr. Saretzky: He was an older brother?    Mr. Libsohn: An older brother, yes, and he always had some kind of a restaurant. I remember a little bit about living in Brooklyn… on a big street named after a Polish general. I remember it was a snowy day and I was wearing a snowsuit. I still remember the snowsuit, I must have either hated it or liked it because it was warm but it was khaki. It was made out of khaki wool so that means it was right after World War I. There must have been a lot of khaki wool around. We had a wood burning stove in a great big kitchen. At that end of the kitchen was a great big stove and you could buy these little bundles of wood that were tied together for the stove. That's all I remember about that.    Mr. Saretzky: You were too young to remember the war.    Mr. Libsohn: Yes, but I remember talk about Harding and Wilson and whatever. Harding, mainly.    Mr. Saretzky: Did your parents like Harding?    Mr. Libsohn: I don't think they liked him at all. My father liked Debs.    Mr. Saretzky: He liked Eugene Debs, the socialist?    Mr. Libsohn: The socialist, yes. All of that reverberated under this table, while the relatives were playing poker on the weekend. Every couple of weeks they would sort of revolve. You'd go to aunt so and so, or whatever. So you get all the talk of who's doing what in Warsaw, where my father came from. My mother's relatives would not discuss [things] so much. But some of them lived out in Greenpoint which is really far from where we were.    Mr. Saretzky: Is that out on Long Island?    Mr. Libsohn: No, Greenpoint is in Brooklyn, way out. Now it's become an artist's hangout. But Greenpoint used to be a pretty lonely place as I remember it.    Mr. Saretzky: Was your father involved in a union?    Mr. Libsohn: Yes, since he worked on shoes, he was always involved in a shoe workers union. He was a very good leather craftsman. Unionism in those days was not like what you think of it today. In those days you really got your ass kicked if you belonged to any union or even talked about a union. There were all kinds of shenanigans going on. It was not too long after the big Triangle Shirtwaist Company fire on Broadway in 1911 that unionism sparked nationally. That was the fire where the windows and doors were shut and all these people couldn't get out. Debs was a real hero, apparently, to a lot of working people and he badly deserved it because he was one of the uncorruptibles.    Mr. Saretzky: He spent some time in jail for his beliefs, so many people must have really respected him for doing that.    Mr. Libsohn: Yes. And then there was the Sacco and Vanzetti case.     Mr. Saretzky: You were a teenager when that happened. Was that a big thing for the people you knew at that time?    Mr. Libsohn: Oh, yes, it was. It was enormous.    Mr. Saretzky: How old were you when you were able to come out from under and sit at the table and discuss these things?     Mr. Libsohn: We never grew up. Kids never grew up in those days.     Mr. Saretzky: You were always the kid?    Mr. Libsohn: Yes, I had to run away to become a grown up.    Mr. Saretzky: How old were you when you ran away?    Mr. Libsohn: Oh, about seventeen or something like that. I ran away. I went to live in downtown New York.    Mr. Saretzky: Did you tell anybody you were going?    Mr. Libsohn: Not really. I just went.    Mr. Saretzky: Did you know anybody there? Where did you sleep?    Mr. Libsohn: Not really. I got a job and I slept in someone's studio. I had been hanging around artists and stuff.    Mr. Saretzky: You had already gotten interested in art by that time.    Mr. Libsohn: Well, I thought maybe I wanted to be a painter or something. I thought, I can't afford to go to school. So I got a job as a model. Someone had given me a camera when I was kid. When I was growing up, see… we lived in a very peculiar neighborhood. A lot of it was poor and we were one of the poor ones. You know my father was out of a job most of the time because he was a union man. At one time, he was forced to become a leather bookbinder  he didn't like that much. I still have some of his tools around here. He was a very fine craftsman and I really learned a lot without thinking about whether I was learning or not. He tried to get me a job. My uncle was a shoe manufacturer, and like most rich guys, he was very proud of being successful. So my father got me a job there. I wanted to be a shoe designer. I started looking around at what was going on. My uncle used to go to Paris every year to pick up samples. I'd look at the sample and then I would look at the shoes he was manufacturing which were copies of these things. I would say, "There's quite a difference between these two." So my father would say, "Keep quiet." I couldn't keep quiet, so I found myself looking for another line of work. I think that's about where I split and went off. The first time I ever got downtown was to get this job.     Mr. Saretzky: Before that you were in Brooklyn?    Mr. Libsohn: No, in the Bronx. We lived in the Bronx for a long time.    Mr. Saretzky: What was the last grade you went to in school?    Mr. Libsohn: Well, I did two years of college, at City College at night. That meant going four years.    Mr. Saretzky: But that was later on.    Mr. Libsohn: Later on, yes.     Mr. Saretzky: But when you ran off, had you graduated from high school?     Mr. Libsohn: Oh, yes. Norman Cousins was my classmate and we were friends in the school. We were in Roosevelt High School when it first opened on Porter Road. Later he got a job at WBMX. It was a little tiny station with an office way down in the East Bronx. He was the sports guy and he had a slight lisp. He did the announcements, sports announcements down there. We were proud of him for being able to get the job. We sort of worked together on school publications and stuff like that together.    Mr. Saretzky: So he was interested in editorial work that early. Later he was the editor of the Saturday Review. Is he still around?     Mr. Libsohn: No, he's dead. One day I was across the street from the hotel on 43rd Street and I looked up and there was Norman, but his name fell out of my head. So I said, "Hey, " and I stood there. So I told him his name had fallen out of my head. He was so mad at me because he was a big shot by then.    Mr. Saretzky: Let's go back to when you ran away. I'm really fascinated that you just ran away.    Mr. Libsohn: Well I didn't run away. I just told my parents, "Look, I have to be on my own."    Mr. Saretzky: So you went downtown?    Mr. Libsohn: I went downtown and I rented a cot in an artist studio for, I don't know how much, but it was very little.    Mr. Saretzky: Did you have your camera with you?    Mr. Libsohn: Yes. Let me tell you how I got a camera. There was a guy on our block whose father was pretty well off most of the time. See - we lived on a block where there was one tenement. A farmhouse on the corner was being taken apart by the kids. You know, that was the high lot, and then across the street were the low lots where all our bedsprings were. We could play and bounce around. Those were our playground toys. You had to learn to walk on the top of the billboards which were maybe about almost a foot wide. Now if you could walk on those billboards without falling you were okay. You were one of the gang, and stuff like that. And not only that, but World War I had left a hell of a lot of buildings unfinished in the Bronx. You know they all went broke. So what you had were foundations with no windows in them and there were spaces like that wide and the kids used to run around on all the foundations.    Mr. Saretzky: And one of these people on the block gave you the camera?    Mr. Libsohn: No. There were these combinations of families  the people who lived in our apartment house were mostly very poor. There was a guy who used to be a delivery man for John Wanamaker and he was always dressed up. Those delivery wagons were very fancy in those days. So he'd come home from work and that was one family. I think he was non-Jewish. Nobody would say that he wasn't Jewish but we knew that his mother was Jewish. Nobody talked about it much. We talked about it once and then we forgot it. That was one of the families. His name was Marty Friedman. He was very much interested in photography and his father was a big jewelry dealer. Then there was another guy, Max Asch, who was a friend of mine, and his father was an art dealer who had a place on 45th Street, between 5th and 6th Avenues.    Mr. Saretzky: Was he the one who gave you the camera?    Mr. Libsohn: No. You know I didn't even know where 45th Street was or what this place looked like. All I knew was that Max Asch's father's house had always little blondes, nudes, and lamps, and God knows what all the crap that you find in all the middle rich homes. And there were some brownstones around our area. There was a guy who was a junk dealer whose family must be multimillionaires by now. There were all these guys, and there were football heroes from NYU. I don't remember their names, but it was a peculiar mix. And there used to be a race course right around our area, which is not a race course anymore, it's where the "guineas" grew vegetables. The Italian families each had a little vegetable garden until the Sterling Baseball team took over the lot and started a semipro team there. Some of the guys made it to the pros, and we were right near Yankee Stadium and we were right near the Polo Grounds. So we had a real feeling….    Mr. Saretzky: Interesting neighborhood. Let me just bring you back to the camera though.    Mr. Libsohn: All right, so going back to the camera. This guy had all the cameras he could possibly use. He started a darkroom and stuff.    Mr. Saretzky: Which fellow was this?    Mr. Libsohn: Mark Friedman, the jewelery guy, and his father and mother. I think there were rumors that his father had another family somewhere else and whatever  so this is where you grow up with all of the things that your not. . .you know now-a-days, all this is nothing, but in those days, this was all revelation.    Mr. Saretzky: Everybody had a story.    Mr. Libsohn: Right. There was a little old lady who lived up in the house, which was falling apart. She was bringing up geese.     Mr. Saretzky: How old where you when Mr. Friedman gave you the camera?     Mr. Libsohn: He had a camera around that was not functioning and he was about to throw it out. I said, "What's the matter with it?" because I was always a good fixer. He said, "I don't know. I can't fix this thing. I lost the part or something. You can have it," and so I took it. I installed a string inside so I could pull the shutter, and I had a cable release that went like this. It was a folding camera. That was a good camera in those days.     Mr. Saretzky: Did you develop the film yourself or did you take it some place?    Mr. Libsohn: I may have tried to develop a roll at his place, I don't recall. He lived in one of those two family houses on the block. We lived in the apartment building. Then the neighborhood was developed. They built more two family houses and Italian families started moving in.    Mr. Saretzky: So you had this camera. By the time you went downtown, had you done a quite a bit of photography?    Mr. Libsohn: Not really, but I was interested. I just had the camera. I don't know what I was interested in becoming. I liked the idea of being a painter or something.    Mr. Saretzky: What happened after you moved downtown?    Mr. Libsohn: I started modeling and photographing paintings to make a living. I photographed lots of very fine paintings by Philip Evergood.    Mr. Saretzky: You were basically self taught as a photographer?    Mr. Libsohn: Right. And at City College, I met Sid Grossman.    Mr. Saretzky: I'm glad you mentioned him. I was hoping we would get to Sid Grossman at some point because, as is well known, you and Sid Grossman are credited with beginning The Photo League.    Mr. Libsohn: All kinds of people claim that they started The Photo League.    Mr. Saretzky: The only story I know is you and Sid Grossman started the Photo League. It's my understanding that the Photo League started in 1936 when The Film and Photo League separated into two groups. The Film and Photo League had started as the Workers Film and Photo League in 1930. There were hundreds of such groups that had started in Germany in support of the class struggle against capitalism. Did you and Sid join The Film and Photo League before it split into the two groups?    Mr. Libsohn: Yes.    Mr. Saretzky: Do you know what year that was?    Mr. Libsohn: I don't remember.     Mr. Saretzky: It must have been before 1936 when the split took place.     Mr. Libsohn: Right.    Mr. Saretzky: But you and Sid weren't founders of The Film and Photo League?    Mr. Libsohn: No.    Mr. Saretzky: That already was in existence at the point that you joined?    Mr. Libsohn: Yes. And there was Leo Hurwitz and Paul Strand. Strand never really was a joiner. He was associated with Hurwitz.    Mr. Saretzky: In 1935, both Hurwitz and Strand (along with Ralph Steiner), worked as cameramen on The Plow That Broke the Plains, the famous documentary film. So when the split occurred of The Film and Photo League, you had already been involved with the League for a year or two at that point?    Mr. Libsohn: Right. Both of us joined together.    Mr. Saretzky: Why did you join?    Mr. Libsohn: We were involved in left-wing stuff in City College of New York. You know there were these strikes and God knows what demonstrations against President Robinson, you remember.    Mr. Saretzky: I don't remember, no, you'd have to tell me about that.    Mr. Libsohn: There was a lot of turmoil around the college. City College was a great school actually. It was as good a college as you could find in the United States, and some of the scholars around it were great, although some were terrible. Mainly, where you got your education was in what we called "the alcoves," which were underneath the great hall which was like a tremendous auditorium. It looked like a cathedral with a beautiful organ in it. That's where I really learned my music appreciation. It was not in a classroom but right there. E. Power Biggs used to practice the organ there. That's the first time I really got to hear Bach. There were classes in music appreciation and I'd be in study hall period there so I'd move a little closer and I learned the forms of sonatas and concertos and God knows what. It was interesting.    Mr. Saretzky: So what were you studying at the college?    Mr. Libsohn: Well, I didn't know. I just wanted a general course. I just wanted to go to college. I just took courses in math. I was good in math, but I lost my interest because the teacher was very dull and crazy. So I skipped classes and we'd sit around and talk. We started a magazine, in which I became one of the guys, a sort of an editor.    Mr. Saretzky: What was the name of it?    Mr. Libsohn: Naivete. I think it went through one issue in mimeograph. We worked our tails off publishing this magazine. And it was an interesting little book.     Mr. Saretzky: It was a literary magazine?    Mr. Libsohn: It was both literary and something else. I guess it was unconsciously something like the New Yorker, which I had never even read. We got someone to do a wonderful cartoon for us, a cousin of mine, a bit of a genius who later on wound up writing plays for these theater groups in a little Greenwich Village theater on the west side of Washington Square Park.     Mr. Saretzky: Let's go back to The Photo League a little bit. How did you meet Sid Grossman?    Mr. Libsohn: We met at the college in the alcoves. I got involved with this magazine that he was part of. He had a friend who was even more involved and we sat around and we worked at it and so that was our introduction to The Photo League.    Mr. Saretzky: And so when you went to The Photo League, why did you join? Did you need a darkroom?     Mr. Libsohn: Yes, we needed a darkroom and the darkroom was in terrible shape. The interest of filmmakers and still photographers are not really much compatible. They sound compatible but they're not. So Sid and I said, "Well, somehow, this is all screwy. These guys don't seem to want to hang around with us and vice versa, so let's see if we can talk this out." They wanted to move away somewhere, anyway. Most of those guys came out of families with money.    Mr. Saretzky: So they were different from you and had different interests?    Mr. Libsohn: Yes, they had kind of a left-wing point of view.    Mr. Saretzky: But you guys did, too. How were they different?    Mr. Libsohn: They were different in terms of the kind of work they were interested in. Now Sid knew a lot more about photography. He had gotten involved, I don't know how, but he was more of a reader than I was, for one thing. He knew more about poetry than I did, and I learned quite a bit from him. So we broadened our interests and we went around to visit Alfred Stieglitz. Stieglitz was very strange sitting in his back room with his cape on and here's two raggedy guys coming in. You know, wondering what the hell are these guys doing here? I felt very uncomfortable around Stieglitz.    Mr. Saretzky: He was kind of forbidding? He was much older than you, too, for one thing.    Mr. Libsohn: Oh, yes he was.    Mr. Saretzky: He was about as old as you are now.    Mr. Libsohn: Yes, but Strand welcomed us. Even though he could be forbidding, too.    Mr. Saretzky: They were hard to approach?     Mr. Libsohn: Yes. It's funny, you know, Ben Shahn never gave you that attitude, but Walker Evans would.    Mr. Saretzky: You certainly knew all the great figures of photography from this period.    Mr. Libsohn: Yes. One of the things that was happening at the time we were involved, was that there was this movement of photography towards the arts. Not that it hadn't happened before, you know, under Stieglitz. For instance this young fellow that I was working with did bromoil….    Mr. Saretzky: That's an art printing process.    Mr. Libsohn: If I talk to any photographer today about what a bromoil is he wouldn't know.    Mr. Saretzky: Right, because that was for Pictorialism.    Mr. Libsohn: It was a kind of an art of the art of photography.    Mr. Saretzky: Right, very fine printing process.    Mr. Libsohn: Well it's a fine printing process, it's hands on and using oil paints.    Mr. Saretzky: It takes it away from the realism. You were more interested in social realism?    Mr. Libsohn: Right. We were interested in social realism and the value of social realism. In the value of the photograph as a document. In addition, we were very conscious of the history of photography and its usefulness.    Mr. Saretzky: In the 1940 U.S. Camera Annual in which your work, The Chelsea Document, was published, you were quoted as saying, "I believe in functional photography because it has the quality of extreme clarity and to the audience a vivid realism. Documentation of a social scene or photo sociological study is one of the functions to which photography is particularly well adapted." Do you still believe that?    Mr. Libsohn: Oh, yes.    Mr. Saretzky: I think this is very consistent with the emphasis at The Photo League in documenting social conditions.    Mr. Libsohn: Right, but I'm not convinced entirely that's where it's all at. In other words, I have another dimension. In fact, I have a poster in here of a show at the New York Public Library, and it's a show that I had gotten underway because… Romana Javitz...    Mr. Saretzky: Romana Javitz. When was this exhibit?    Mr. Libsohn: Oh, maybe two years ago. Romana Javitz is the one who started the picture collections in the New York Public Library. It's her eye, her head, everything about the way she thought about it.    Mr. Saretzky: I'm looking at a picture here. It says, "Subject Matters -- Photography."    Mr. Libsohn: This is what I was trying to think of.    Mr. Saretzky: Not the art side but the subject side. Not so much who's making the picture but what's in the picture.    Mr. Libsohn: That doesn't mean that she didn't know anything about art or didn't produce art. Practically any artist you talk to knows that she was important. That what she said, what she thought, what she put together in her mind was important, and it mattered. Okay now that means that, that word that "subject matters" is a very broad and very deep word. And that's really the way I feel about it. It's not so much that the subject matter has to be exactly right and all of that. There are things in there that everything is important, every word, every information. It's like music, like poetry.    Mr. Saretzky: At the League, with "subject matter" in photography, there seems to be competing points of view between wanting to document social conditions and using photography as an art form.    Mr. Libsohn: Like history. Historians record the same incidents and describe the same incidents and they almost sound the same, but they don't sound the same, and they never agree with each other. Now why is that? But photography has an added point to it. Photography can be as exact a reproduction, in terms of time, in terms of the imagery. I think you've got my point. Photography has that added conviction, let's put it that way. Not that it is always super correct, but it has the added conviction and that is what's important. And every time Romona and I would visit or have lunch or whatever, we'd talk a little bit about that. Because she was just as much interested as I was.     Mr. Saretzky: One of the activities that you got involved with at The Photo League was what was called The Chelsea Document. Can you tell me what that was all about?    Mr. Libsohn: Well, that picture I showed you was part of it.    Mr. Saretzky: This was one of several neighborhoods in New York that was documented by the League.    Mr. Libsohn: Well, we tried. One of the problems with being an organizer or part of the inner organs of The Photo League is that you spent most of your time trying to raise money, trying to get people to do things and so on. So there wasn't all that much time to do photography and so forth.    Mr. Saretzky: You did some and your exhibit with Sid Grossman of The Chelsea Document, was exhibited in quite a few places in New York    Mr. Libsohn: I don't remember.    Mr. Saretzky: It was exhibited at The League, of course, but also at the Chelsea Tenants League, The Hudson Guild and elsewhere. Now there was another group at The Photo League, the Aaron Siskind group. It was called the Feature Group and documented Harlem. Had you ever considered joining that group?    Mr. Libsohn: No. See Aaron had formed his own group and he represented another point of view.    Mr. Saretzky: How did his point of view differ from your point of view?    Mr. Libsohn: Well, it didn't really, you know it's just that Aaron…see Aaron was one of the guys who had a job.    Mr. Saretzky: He was a teacher.    Mr. Libsohn: And he had a point of view that was more shaped than ours was. Ours was a growing point of view, and his was more… he'd been around longer. He was not as left-wing as some of us were.    Mr. Saretzky: He apparently resisted attempts to get him more politically involved.    Mr. Libsohn: It could be, but I don't remember it being that important. But I'm just giving you my offhand impression. I never resented him for that. I thougt, well, okay this guy had been around a lot longer, he knew more people than I knew. He knew more things about photography. He had better cameras and stuff like that, and I'm perfectly willing to learn something from him.    Mr. Saretzky: He was interested in doing documentation in the thirties, as you were. And then he shifted to wanting to do more abstraction, which is what you are doing more now, too, in your painting. I don't know if you want to comment on that but it seems like you kind of moved in the same direction that he did although you did it a little bit later.    Mr. Libsohn: Yes, and not only that, but I think I stay in touch a little bit better, a little more pointedly. For instance [in that picture on the wall], there's a quote, an abstraction of New York. I designed that as a cover for the New Yorker. It's an abstraction, but  you know where it's at. It couldn't happen anywhere  it could only happen in New York.    Mr. Saretzky: So it still has a hook in reality, whereas Aaron's work was much more divorced from any particular reference point.    Mr. Libsohn: Now there's a memorial to Esther Bubley. I don't know whether you know her work or not. There's a picture of Esther Bubley in the middle of that. It has to do with my interest in music.    Mr. Saretzky: It's a geometric painting of interlocking shapes of different tones.    Mr. Libsohn: Right, but it has to do with music with a kind of a musical arrangement. It shows my appreciation of jazz. And she was interested in jazz, too.     Mr. Saretzky: I'm interested in the political aspect of The Photo League. How important was it?    Mr. Libsohn: Well, it was very important.     Mr. Saretzky: Tell me a little about how.    Mr. Libsohn: Like when those unions would go out to sea like the Longshoreman's Union and Chelsea Document, that picture I showed you. These guys were just hanging around doing nothing. That was part of Chelsea  there was an emptiness to it. In the morning there was this frantic quality to it.    Mr. Saretzky: So there was this sympathy for the people on the lower end of the socioeconomic spectrum that was motivating some of your work at this point?    Mr. Libsohn: We marched in May Day Parades and stuff like that.    Mr. Saretzky: You mentioned that you didn't hold it against Aaron that he didn't want to be more a part of that, but were there other people at the Photo League that didn't agree with you?    Mr. Libsohn: I don't think Aaron had a complaint in the world against any of us in that sense. If he didn't agree with us, he sure hung around for a hell of a long time.    Mr. Saretzky: Well, how about this fellow Izzy Lerner. Do you remember Isadore Lerner?    Mr. Libsohn: No.    Mr. Saretzky: He was a fellow back in the days of the Film and Photo League, who had gone to Russia and he'd come back and talked about his experiences. He wasn't entirely favorable about the Soviet Union, and apparently he was expelled from the league. Now this probably was before your time.    Mr. Libsohn: Not in my time.    Mr. Saretzky: Had the League become less political by your time?     Mr. Libsohn: It depends on where you get the information from…You know, that information may not be correct.    Mr. Saretzky: That could be, but if true, I guess you weren't around when that occurred. It must have been before you joined.    Mr. Libsohn: Then there was Calomiris.    Mr. Saretzky: Angela Calomiris?    Mr. Libsohn: She was part of the FBI.     Mr. Saretzky: Right, she was the informer who wrote the book, Red Masquerade, in part about her undercover experiences while a Photo League member.    Mr. Libsohn: Whatever stories she made up, I don't know what the hell they were.    Mr. Saretzky: She was not a very trustworthy source of information?    Mr. Libsohn: What she did was really make Sid's life hard for him.    Mr. Saretzky: People who are reading this who might not be familiar with that story, so could you just tell me a little bit about what happened there?    Mr. Libsohn: Well, all I know is that she turned up saying that she had been recruited and certainly not by me. She was obviously a lesbian. If you think that homosexuals are not popular now, at that time they were terribly unpopular and we knew she was a homosexual, but we made nothing of it. We tried to make her feel comfortable. So that's all I know about Angela Calomiris. But what she did to Sid was really horrible.    Mr. Saretzky: What did she do?     Mr. Libsohn:Oh, I don't know, she was an admitted FBI informer and she sent in reports about Sid. I don't know what the hell she said, because I've never really sent for those reports.    Mr. Saretzky: So you haven't read them.    Mr. Libsohn: I've never seen them and I don't give a shit. And I wouldn't talk to her if I ever saw her.    Mr. Saretzky: I'm sure you wouldn't because she really shafted you guys. The League continued to exist until the early fifties. Did you stay with it until it closed?     Mr. Libsohn: No. I got into a big argument with Sid over something. Sid was a very tough guy to be around. He was a very, very… he could be very nasty at some point but he was a very wise…    Mr. Saretzky: What was he like? Tell me about him?    Mr. Libsohn: He had a very brilliant mind. You know, his background was really tough, economically. We shared everything. Whenever I had a job, I always shared whatever I had with him and stuff like that. Every so often he could go off on a big tangent of grinding some idea into the ground, you know, including, you know, just getting nasty. I just decided, "Oh, the hell with this," and walked away from it, that's all.    Mr. Saretzky: Do you remember about when it was that you left?    Mr. Libsohn: No, I don't really but I'll tell it was just after we moved to…. Oh, I had come up with an idea when Senator McCarthy had started going after us, it was obvious that he was going to …    Mr. Saretzky: This must have been after The League turned up on the Attorney General's list of subversive organizations.    Mr. Libsohn: Sid and I had a meeting and I said, "Look. I'm going to go down and talk to Steichen about this." He had just gotten this job at the Museum of Modern Art so that would give you some idea of what the dates were.    Mr. Saretzky: About 1947, 1948, right around there.    Mr. Libsohn: Steichen saw me and I said, "Look, here's what's happening at The Photo League. We are being called subversive and all of that and if possible we would like to show what we do, if you think the work is important enough." This was a crazy idea because here's this guy that just got this job.     Mr. Saretzky: You didn't want to risk his new job.    Mr. Libsohn: Yes, see that's how naive we were. But he was very nice. He says, "I'll join the Photo League." But he never did.    Mr. Saretzky: Well, the membership actually reached its peak after it went on that list, people joining in support of the League. It got more popular than ever for a short period of time.    Mr. Libsohn: That's what I'm saying. McCarthy was really…So anyway, that's the last I had to do with it. And we had some kind of an argument. I don't know what it was.    Mr. Saretzky: So you weren't there at the end?    Mr. Libsohn: No.    Mr. Saretzky: At that point were you working as a freelance photographer?    Mr. Libsohn: Yes.    Mr. Saretzky: One of the people that you did work for was Roy Stryker for the Standard Oil Project. Roy Stryker was one of the leading figures in photography in this period. Not as a photographer, but as someone who hired photographers to do documentary work. Roy Stryker had been the director of the photography program at the Farm Security Administration in the 1930s, but at that point I don't believe that you worked for him.     Mr. Libsohn: No.    Mr. Saretzky: You only started working for him after he left the Federal government and went to work for Standard Oil of New Jersey, which is now Exxon. How soon after he went to Standard Oil of New Jersey did you begin doing freelance work for him?    Mr. Libsohn: I think it was in the beginning actually, alyhough not the very beginning.    Mr. Saretzky: It's about the mid 1940s.    Mr. Libsohn: When did he go to work?     Mr. Saretzky: 1943.    Mr. Libsohn: It was just shortly after he had gotten on… he'd gotten underway with Russell Lee, I think.    Mr. Saretzky: Russell Lee was one and Esther Bubley was another person.    Mr. Libsohn: No, Esther Bubley came on after I came on.    Mr. Saretzky: Oh, after you did, okay. There were some other people who worked for him there, including: I guess, Harold Corsini and Gordon Parks.    Mr. Libsohn: Corsini was in the Photo League.    Mr. Saretzky: Right. There was another photographer who's name was Ehrenburg remember him?    Mr. Libsohn: Yes but Mike Ehrenburg never was in the Photo League as far as I was concerned. He and I were in a partnership.    Mr. Saretzky: In the 1941 U.S. Camera Annual, it mentions that you were working with Myron Ehrenburg and it said that….    Mr. Libsohn: Right, but not in the Photo league.    Mr. Saretzky: It didn't mention the Photo League, but it said that you were working on the first mystery novel illustrated with original photographs.    Mr. Libsohn: Right. It was by Elliot Paul, who is his brother-in-law.    Mr. Saretzky: Was this book ever published?    Mr. Libsohn: Oh sure.    Mr. Saretzky: Do you remember the name of it?    Mr. Libsohn: Yes. In fact, I might have a copy of it around here somewhere. It might have been Hugger-Mugger in the Louvre.    Mr. Saretzky: If you could find it before I leave, I'd like to see it, because the first mystery novel illustrated with photographs is certainly a landmark in the history of photography.    Mr. Libsohn: He also played boogie woogie piano.  He was sort of a left- wing guy.     Bess Tremper: One of the books he wrote was called the Mysteries of the Rue Morgue.    Mr. Saretzky: We'll look it up later. Let's continue with your freelance activities. Were you able to make a good living doing freelance photography or did you always have to do some other jobs?    Mr. Libsohn: Not really. I worked for Social Work Magazine, which was the magazine of the Social Workers Association, and photographed paintings and everything I could lay my hands on. I was making a good enough living, more or less.    Mr. Saretzky: But your income was coming from photography.    Mr. Libsohn: And I had a job, yes, it was more or less coming… modeling, everything.    Mr. Saretzky: So you had some other sources as well.    Mr. Libsohn: Yes. Well one day I got a call I finally got a steady job as a model. I was trying to get associated with Berenice Abbott, but Berenice Abbott was very, very cautious about keeping her own thing to herself. So I wasn't able to do that because she had… see the one big successful thing on WPA was the movie thing, the Writers project, which put out this whole series of guides and they were wonderful. I tried to get a job photographing for the guide. It was kind of tough, but the easiest thing to get was as a model, so I got on as a model. Finally, I just barely got transferred to photography and I don't even remember, who the hell I was working for. I remember doing some pictures somewhere on the East Side. Sid and I would have loved to have worked for Roy Stryker. At the FSA. As the exhibition chairman at the League, I put on shows including the FSA show. I put on shows of Ansel Adams, stuff that the Museum of Modern Art repeated after us. Edward Weston was wonderful with us. He came down and talked. Well then, we just couldn't afford to go to Washington to apply for a job, so we never made it to see Roy Stryker. But we did get to meet him at the Photo League. He came up. One day I get a call from him saying, "Could you come in and see me?" By then he was working for Standard Oil Company [at their office in New York City]. So I said, "Gee, I wonder what the hell he's doing there." He tells me that he had seen some of my portraits in the social work magazines and you know here I am working for about twenty-five dollars a week or something like that, and would I like to photograph some of the oil workers in the refineries. I'm saying, "Gee, that sounds like a great idea."    Mr. Saretzky: Sure, photos of workers, that's right up your alley.    Mr. Libsohn: He said, "You know, I've got an idea going. Would you like to work for us? We can pay about fifty bucks a day."     Mr. Saretzky: That sounded pretty good.    Mr. Libsohn: That sounded pretty good to me. So I said, "Got to go tell my wife about this and I'll call you." I called him, naturally, and that's how we got to live here.    Mr. Saretzky: That's how you came to Roosevelt?    Mr. Libsohn: Yes, that's how we got to Monmouth County.    Mr. Saretzky: So Roy Stryker got you to Monmouth County.    Mr. Libsohn: Right.    Mr. Saretzky: Because you got a little money from working for Standard Oil?    Mr. Libsohn: Yes, money started rolling in, and not only that, we got raises. In fact, when I got here, I'd always paid for everything with cash so I'd never had any dealings with a bank. I never had a mortgage before. When I came out here,, I didn't even have the brains to look around to see if there were any other houses. I just walked into this one house. I was introduced by one of my former students who apparently got a commission on the sale.    Mr. Saretzky: Why Roosevelt?    Mr. Libsohn: Because I really wanted to come out here to talk to Ben Shahn, who was one of my hero photographers.    Mr. Saretzky: Why did you have such respect for Ben Shahn at that time?    Mr. Libsohn: One of the photographers who I thought was pretty damn wonderful was Ben Shahn. We had exhibited some of his work in the Photo League. And Walker Evans. Walker Evans was a photographer also.    Mr. Saretzky: He was Ben Shahn's roommate.    Mr. Libsohn: Right. He was Ben Shahn's friend. But that's okay. Look, this is all growing up. We were all in tghe same work.    Mr. Saretzky: Was Ben Shahn such a hero to you that you decided that you were going to go to New Jersey and live in the same town?    Mr. Libsohn: No, I didn't decide that. I came out here to talk to him and I just wanted to see where he lived and why he lived out here. Just out of a matter of sheer curiosity.    Mr. Saretzky: And what did you find? What was your impression of this place?    Mr. Libsohn: Well, when I came out here, I thought, wow, it's not too far from New York. I have two kids  they need to go to school and here we live in a fifth floor walk up in New York. This place has fresh air and a school right in the middle of town. And this guy said, "They're selling these houses for $6,500." So I said, "Gee, that sounds reasonable. How do you go about doing this?" So we walked in here and there was a kid crawling around on the floor here.    Mr. Saretzky: This house right here that we're in now?    Mr. Libsohn: Yes, this house.    Mr. Saretzky: Oh! So you've been in here since…    Mr. Libsohn: Since 1947.    Mr. Saretzky: 1947! How about that? At that point was Roosevelt already becoming an artist community?    Mr. Libsohn: No, it's never become the artist community. I mean it's always been a pretty damned wonderful combination of Americana and the artists have been very influential. The clothing workers have been very influential. Everybody has been very influential, even the reactionaries. And if the United States really wanted -- and they have declared this a historic monument--if they really knew how essential an historic monument they have here. It's a monument to a democracy of various ideas, various peoples, various everything and a nature preservation idea, and a decent upbringing for your kids idea. It is really… it's a monument that should be preserved, as well as any monument of FDR, as well as any monument of Abe Lincoln  this is a monument to how democracy can work if it's encouraged.    Mr. Saretzky: When you first came here did you immediately get involved in the community?    Mr. Libsohn: No.    Mr. Saretzky: Were you welcomed by any other people?    Mr. Libsohn: Yes, I became a friend of Ben's.     Mr. Saretzky: And who else did you come to know here?    Mr. Libsohn: All kinds of people  my neighbors.    Mr. Saretzky: How about the Edwin Rosskam?     Mr. Libsohn: Edwin Rosskam and I met at the Photo League once and I met him…    Mr. Saretzky: Was he already here at that time?    Mr. Libsohn: No, I met him on the job. He was on the Standard Oil project before I was.    Mr. Saretzky: Did he come to Roosevelt afterwards?    Mr. Libsohn: Afterward, much after.    Mr. Saretzky: So were you one reason he came here?     Mr. Libsohn: No, he came here through the Shahns.    Mr. Saretzky: Would you say Ben Shahn was sort of a central figure who things revolved around here or were there other people in Roosevelt when you came here who seemed to be the key people in the community from your point of view?    Mr. Libsohn: There were no real… well, all the key people were the leftovers of the original cooperative. You know there were lots of these Jewish….See we have sent more kids to Ivy League colleges per capita than any other community in the United States, without having the money of what Westchester County has.    Mr. Saretzky: Why would that be?     Mr. Libsohn: Well because there was this atmosphere of how important education is,… things like that. There were people around who really wanted to be millionaires when they grew up and they didn't become millionaires.    Mr. Saretzky: Did you meet a lot of people through your children?     Mr. Libsohn: Oh sure. These doors were never shut and you know anybody would come in and you'd have a cup of coffee and you'd go out and take a ride somewhere. It was great for people like myself who were freelancers. Even when I was working for the Standard Oil company, I was a freelancer. You know, McCarthy penetrated Standard Oil, came up there and said, "Do you know that so and so is left-winger?" I got the idea someone said, "Well, what is this stuff?" So I said, "Look, have them ask me about it. I can tell them where I stand in terms of Standard Oil easily."    Mr. Saretzky: So what happened with that?    Mr. Libsohn: Nothing. I was not working on salary. I was working as a contractor. So the work dropped off. They had an easy way out.    Mr. Saretzky: Did you continue working for Standard Oil after Roy Stryker left in 1950?    Mr. Libsohn: Not really, no.    Mr. Saretzky: So when he left that was it for you.    Mr. Libsohn: I think I did work for them occasionally.    Mr. Saretzky: Who were some of your other clients that you worked for?    Mr. Libsohn: Fortune, Ladies Home Journal.     Mr. Saretzky: At Fortune, did you get work from Walker Evans who was the picture editor?    Mr. Libsohn: No. I worked for Leo Leoni.    Mr. Saretzky: How about Princeton University? How did you get involved with them?    Mr. Libsohn: I think the same thing. I was doing something with the guy who became the secretary of labor and who had a bookstore in Princeton. I forget his name. A guy who started the college for getting your degree out of your work experience.    Mr. Saretzky: Thomas Edison College.     Mr. Libsohn: Yes, the guy who started Thomas Edison College. He liked my photographs. He got me going and somehow…. I don't know why, but I got going.    Mr. Saretzky: I have a few publications from 1964 and 1965 here from Princeton University and there's some wonderful photographs of African Americans in the Princeton Cooperative School Program and the Summer Studies program. I just wanted to ask you about that.    Mr. Libsohn: That was a wonderful program.    Mr. Saretzky: Is this directly related to your earlier interest in documenting the disadvantaged people in New York? Does that relate to why you photographed African Americans who are trying to move ahead during the Civil Rights era?    Mr. Libsohn: No, it's just that I happened to be at the right place at the right time. I never really utilized my background, so to speak, or used it as a way of getting this work, no. It was the type of work that I liked to do. I just happened to be doing it.    Mr. Saretzky: Were you on the staff at Princeton?    Mr. Libsohn: Yes, I worked with Dr. McCracken. I worked on one of the summer programs and that was a very interesting program.     Mr. Saretzky: What was your role there? What did you do?    Mr. Libsohn: I was one of the art teachers.    Mr. Saretzky: And who were the students? Where did they come from?    Mr. Libsohn: That's the way McCracken worked  he was a professor of education and at one of the Jersey colleges. I don't know how we met… but somehow we met. He was a very interesting guy. He devised a program when we were having all these problems with teenagers and high schools that were falling apart. I had gotten a job working in Trenton High School when they were having the riots. I was teaching photography to some of these kids who were having problems. It was a program that was sponsored by people who knew how to write for grants, and so there I was. I remember we were in the middle of a school that was just seething. I was one of the white guys with about four or five Black guys. I remember we had a white principal at the time who was not very popular and finally they got a Black principal who was even worse than the white one, you know, a real martinet. He just really didn't know how to handle the situation.    For instance, to give you an example: one of the things that I was doing was working with a teacher as a kind of an assistant and we were trying to develop a program of teacher aides. So the teacher, instead of being up in front of the classroom, could be walking around on a one-to-one basis with the youngsters. This teacher I was working with was just absolutely marvelous. Her father had been a superintendent of schools in California somewhere. She really knew how to handle the whole school mechanism. She knew how to teach. She was bright. I remember one time, I was in the class and we had just talked to the youngsters about writing something about themselves and we realized it would be a little tough for them. We went around and told them we'd help them whenever they needed some help if they wanted to discuss, something like that. So at that point this principal walks in, you know the one that I was talking about. He was just strict about everything as anybody could be. But his supervisor, also Black, was much smarter than he was and very, very smart about what he was doing. Anyway, we had just asked the youngsters to think about what they were going to write. He walks in and he sees this kid sitting near the window looking out the window and he said, "You." The kid looks up. He says, "Aren't you supposed to be doing something?" "Yes," he says, "I'm supposed to be thinking." I said, "That's exactly right, we've asked them to think about what they're going to write."    Mr. Saretzky: Now was this a regular class or a photography class?    Mr. Libsohn: It was an English class.    Mr. Saretzky: Did you also teach photography in the summer program?    Mr. Libsohn: Yes. I taught them art and stuff like that. Our program was absolutely flexible. One of the things I did was to take pictures of the kids as if I was covering a story for Fortune magazine, and when we showed them to the kids, the kids would say, "I look like I know what I'm doing." This kid all this time had thought he didn't know what he was doing and now this was proof that he knew what he was doing. And it relates to the hug I got. One day I was walking down one of the main streets in Trenton and a great big Black kid comes up to me and I recognize the face. But you know this was kid who was, maybe… you know, I'm not very tall, but he sure was a lot shorter than I was. He grabs me and gives me a big hug and says, "If it wasn't for you guys I would've been in jail." That made me feel so good. So it didn't matter whether I was doing photography or not. I never think of myself as being "a one person thing." I always think I can fix anything.    Mr. Saretzky: Tell me again, where did that program take place?    Mr. Libsohn: In Trenton High.    Mr. Saretzky: Did your involvement there lead to your work in the Princeton cooperative school program?    Mr. Libsohn: Some of the people from there were recruited by McCracken. I think that's how I got involved.    Mr. Saretzky: I also have a copy here of a very interesting publication also from the same period, the mid 1960s, which is called The Long Road To College: A Summer Of Opportunity, which has photographs of African Americans who are hoping to go to higher education. This was sponsored by the Rockefeller Foundation. Do you recall if you shot those pictures for the publication or did they use pictures that you had already shot for other purposes?    Mr. Libsohn: I don't know. Some of these pictures are not very familiar.    Mr. Saretzky: Some of them are by you and some of them are by other photographers. You are credited on the title page of the book, so I thought I would ask you about it.    Mr. Libsohn: I don't know  it's been a long time.    Mr. Saretzky: Yes, thirty-five years ago. Your work has been published very frequently in magazines and in books. Which book do you feel or magazine has the best of your work in it? Do you have a favorite publication?    Mr. Libsohn: Yes, I'll show you something I did for Standard Oil Company published just recently and it's pretty nice. I really enjoyed seeing it.     Mr. Saretzky: In general, how does your work get placed so that other people can see it and be affected by it? Isn't it important for photographers to get their work "out there?"    Mr. Libsohn: Yes. Here's a reproduction.    Mr. Saretzky: Okay, what book is this that we have here?    Mr. Libsohn: Car Culture.    Mr. Saretzky: Oh, here's a picture by Sol Libsohn. This book is edited by Marlaham Berkenedy, published by Gib Smith in 1998. Sol's picture is on pages fifty-seven and fifty-sight. It shows the back of a Buick, circa 1940. It's got three pennants on it that says Montreal, Rochester, and Sherbrook Exposition, and I guess these are right in between one by Barbara Morgan and one by Marion Post Wolcott and then comes Cartier-Bresson. So you're in very good company there.    Mr. Libsohn: Yes, well, I always seem to be in a very good company.    Mr. Saretzky: Sol, here's another of the many books in which your work has been published: Out of the Forties by Nicholas Lemann, which is about what Roy Stryker directed work for Standard Oil. There's a beautiful picture that you took in New Jersey at the oil company where they were doing some construction.    Mr. Libsohn: That was the construction of the cat cracker.    Mr. Saretzky: It's a wonderful picture  it's got this very strong round form of the cat cracker or a piece of the cat cracker being lifted or lowered into place as they were constructing it. It's got a wonderful geometric quality to it. There are also some other examples of your work in this book. Another book with your work included is this monograph, The Consolidated Freightways Collection, which was published in 1988. How about a very famous photography book and also exhibit that you were represented in, The Family of Man, which was organized by Edward Steichen at the Museum of Modern Art in 1955. Do you recall anything about that?    Mr. Libsohn: Oh, yes. I was very pleased with the idea of them doing the exhibit. I thought it would be an honor to be represented in it. But I discovered… (Laugh)… I just happened to have done a freelance picture of a quilting party or something like that in a Ladies Home Journal story. I guess they just needed to have a quilting party in this Family of Man and to me it was a rather dull picture. But to them it was important because quilting was one of the things that happened a lot in the USA and I guess they couldn't find any quilting pictures.     Mr. Saretzky: Did you go to see the exhibit?    Mr. Libsohn: Oh, yes.     Mr. Saretzky: Do you recall what happened when you went there?    Mr. Libsohn: Well, not really. But it was really… in those days it was a real landmark exhibit. Later on as I thought about it, it seemed to me, you know, all these second thoughts… as you get older you do a little more thinking about what's what. I would've dwelled a little less on the…what I'm really trying to define in my head is the essentials of documenting. You know what the USA is all about. As I recall it, there was a small exhibit that… you know, Romana collected pictures and photographers gathered around her because she had such a beautiful mind. This little exhibit sort of struck notes a little harder about the essentials of what it meant to be a citizen of the USA.    Mr. Saretzky: More so than The Family of Man.    Mr. Libsohn: More so than The Family of Man. At the same time Steichen did rely on Romana for many of the pictures for the show, I think. He was a good friend of Romana's and her influence was around. You really can't second guess things like that. This was a monument, and it should remain that, and it remains that way.    Mr. Saretzky: The book Family of Man is still in print after forty-five years. I can't think of another  photography book that has been in print for forty-five years. Sold millions of copies. So your quilting picture certainly has been seen by millions of people.    Mr. Libsohn: I certainly have some more important pictures around than that.    Mr. Saretzky: When you think of the photographs that you've made, which ones really stand out in your mind as being your favorites that you've taken?    Mr. Libsohn: I was looking for the one in Double Take magazine. Did you have that one here?    Mr. Saretzky: No, but can you describe the picture?    Mr. Libsohn: It's just a straight on portrait, but you know that's the point. What makes a picture important is… because it really recorded… not only an incident, but also a place that somehow relates to the growth of the United States of America in some essential way. I can only describe it by saying take a look at the picture. And it's a very modest picture, as far as I'm concerned, and that's the point. There are many of these pictures around and you could make thousands and thousands of shows of these types of pictures and create history books that are absolutely marvelous… and that's really what's so important. You know art, music, poetry, and real historians that appreciate stuff in that way. Everybody's entitled to their own opinions.    Mr. Saretzky: What would you like me to ask you that we haven't covered so far, that you would like people to know about you or about the twentieth century that you've lived through?    Mr. Libsohn: Well, I enjoyed most of it. I've raised a good family and I've been around people that I enjoyed being around. I've had a good life. I enjoy New York. I enjoy Paris. There's one of my good pictures.    Mr. Saretzky: Okay, we found another. This is a book called Photo League. Naomi Rosenblum is the author and it's a little bit unclear who published this book.    Mr. Libsohn: Yes, it is unclear, and, in fact, I don't know how they got that picture.    Mr. Saretzky: It's a strange catalogue. On the back it says "telephonica des telephonica" and it seems to be in Spanish. There's a very nice photograph by Sol here and it shows a man holding a cigarette on the steps outside of a building in front of an open doorway. There's a lot of very dark tonalities in this picture but there is light that is illuminating his face and his hands.    Mr. Libsohn: I think of it as a little piece of sculpture. As a matter of fact, it was. Because what they were doing was gutting a building for… I think they were building a series of dorms for the Fashion Institute. It was right across from the Fashion Institute. I just noticed this guy standing there and there was something so essential about the guy. It's hard to say why you take a picture. I just know that I need to take it and that's about enough for me. Do I need to describe it? Well there it is. It just seemed important. In terms of who the guy was he was "not the most important person in the world" but he was because there he was. The drawing was so important, the textures, the staging was so important. I'll give you an example of something. The other day we saw….    Mr. Saretzky: (Sol is showing me a framed photograph) Can you describe it?    Mr. Libsohn: I don't know whether this is true or not but here's a picture I took in the street. I've always thought of this guy being an actor. I don't know who the woman is but I never knew who it was. It was just a street picture.    Mr. Saretzky: It's a man and a woman seen in profile and their faces are brightly lit by the sun.    Mr. Libsohn: I've always thought that this was an actor and the other day we saw this play. This was about twenty or twenty-five years after I took this picture, I didn't know who it was and I had a feeling I had seen that guy somewhere before, the main actor in this play. So I examined this thing carefully and, by God, even though he is that much older, the features are pretty much the same.    Mr. Saretzky: Well, I think I agree that he does look like an actor. He has a certain bearing about him and there's something about the lines around his eyes that look like he's spent a lot of time in the floodlights  very distinguished looking man.    Mr. Libsohn: Here's another one of my favorite pictures, of Big Bill Broonzy.    Mr. Saretzky: Big Bill Broonzy was a blues musician.    Mr. Libsohn: He was a guy I knew when I was in the Photo League. Now both Sid and I photographed together. He has some photograph. This is Big Bill singing the blues. Now he is the author of the song, "If You're White, You're Right, If You're Brown Stick Around, If You're Black Get Back, Get Back, Get Back." There's something very beautiful about this guy. I discovered in my collection of records that I have some old jazz records by Washboard Sam. Now this guy happens to be Washboard Sam's half brother and plays with him on these records.    Mr. Saretzky: It's a very dramatically lit portrait  a close up of Big Bill Broonzy's head and shoulders, and he's got what looks like a very dark sweater on or some kind of a pullover.    Mr. Libsohn: No, it's a jacket.    Mr. Saretzky: Some kind of a jacket but what's really lit up is his face, which has very dramatic lighting. Was this done in a studio at the Photo League?     Mr. Libsohn: No, done in an apartment.    Mr. Saretzky: It's amazing. It's an amazing photograph, very powerful. He's got his eyes closed and he just seems to be filled with emotion as he sings.    Mr. Libsohn: Yes, well, that's what real blues is about.    Mr. Saretzky: Now we're looking at Double Take magazine, Spring 1999, and there's an essay by Michael Lesy called, "Evening Snapshot, 1945," with a wonderful photograph by Sol. It shows a group of men indoors  looks like one guy is having a beer. Tell me about this photograph.    Mr. Libsohn: It's a casual photograph, but it's not.    Mr. Saretzky: You mean you set it up?     Mr. Libsohn: No.    Mr. Saretzky: Why were you there?    Mr. Libsohn: It's in a little hotel. I was doing a trucking story and this is where, I was told, the truckers liked to stop. It was in Shartlesville, P.A., which is… I don't know whether the hotel is still there. It may not be any more but it was right on the main road before they built that main road that goes through Shartlesville. I did several photographs there that I think are equally as interesting, but these were the kinds of things that I thought might be interesting to Roy Stryker  however, I couldn't figure out how to fit it in any other way.    Mr. Saretzky: For me this picture has a very cinematic quality. It looks like it's right out ofLibsohnTavern.jpg (32947 bytes) a movie from the 1940s. It's just so real, in terms of just being in the room with these guys and the clock shows on the wall. It's ten after nine at night  they've been at work during the day. They're now having a little bit of relaxation because they've been driving all day. They are truckers, and now they are stopped for the night, and one guy is sipping at his beer, but they are not talking to each other. They all they seem isolated and kind of alienated.    Mr. Libsohn: It was just the most modest hotel and yet the food there… they had these long tables in there with really good… filling, homemade stuff. It's all touristy now, but at that time it wasn't.    Mr. Saretzky: What strikes me about this picture and also about the one you showed me with the actor and maybe a couple of other ones, is that the people in these pictures are not really interacting with each other. You mentioned one man, when he was standing on the steps, he was like a statue. The people seem a little isolated. Is that something that you are attracted to? The sense of separateness and alienation? Is that part of the way you're seeing the society or is this just a compositional preference in your vision?    Mr. Libsohn: I have no real training in composition. I have a sense of isolating things. I think that's what the artist does or the poet does  the musician does. Now if you listen to jazz, for instance, which is a construction by, maybe two, maybe four, maybe five, sometimes even larger  but most of these guys are so confident. They can build stuff by listening and what they are doing is isolating a piece of music. When I say a piece of music, I mean something important  something that means a lot to each one of these guys. So the artist is really actually an isolator of ideas  whatever these ideas are  whether they're important or not  that's not really important to anybody but himself  and whoever sees whatever  and whoever finds something in these things that's great. If the artist can share it, that's wonderful. So I like it when people find stuff in my pictures that I don't even see, but you know…that's what happens. That's the way it is, that's the way I respond.    Mr. Saretzky: You didn't know any of these people?    Mr. Libsohn: No, not really, but I have other pictures of other people around here. There was something about the atmosphere that really took over. I have a picture of a wonderful little truck and a guy… I used to remember his name.     Mr. Saretzky: Well it's a marvelous photograph. The way this fellow in the center here is isolated against this frame of the doorway. It's almost like a picture within a picture and I just think it's a wonderful image.    Mr. Libsohn: So these are some of the pictures that I enjoy.    Bess Tremper: You remember the conference you were in, in California at the University of Southern California? I don't know where the catalog is.    Mr. Libsohn: They had a big show out there.    Mr. Saretzky: You had a big show at the University of California?     Bess Tremper: Yes, in Santa Barbara.    Mr. Saretzky: I wanted to ask you about your painting because now I understand you're doing much more painting than you are doing photography. Were you doing painting all along or did you turn to painting at some point? How did that happen?    Mr. Libsohn: I don't know, I was just sort of fooling around trying to catch certain things that I had done photographically, too. I had photographed in the city some of these buildings and I feel like doing the same thing again. It's just that somehow I'm not related….    Mr. Saretzky: Are the mechanics of photography harder for you now?    Mr. Libsohn: They are much harder and I can't manipulate certain things the way I used to  although, I think I could learn to. You have to get back into it. I used to add a couple chemicals here and there to jazz up the Blacks or whatever. Painting is just an exploration the way you go out photographing or at least I did. But I noticed, for instance, there were days when I would come up with nothing. Other days, practically every picture I took was something I wanted to save. It's very difficult to formulate what it takes to be an artist or poet or painter  you just have to work out your own ideas and keep moving and experimenting. Not worry about whether it's going to work or not, but worry about whether you're saying something that you want to repeat, that you want to record. But these are the things that I like to have around.    Mr. Saretzky: Well, you have a wonderful home and environment, which is just filled with wonderful images and things that you've made.    Mr. Libsohn: There's an Atget.    Mr. Saretzky: Yes, I see a photograph by the famous Parisian photographer Atget who died in 1927. And there is Ben Shahn's picture of Martin Luther King.    Mr. Libsohn: And one by Bernarda Bryson Shahn. That's a wonderful picture by a friend of mine in Paris, who I thought was a poet and a real human being. And this guy worked in…you would be surprised  he had an apartment that was smaller than this. It was a luxurious apartment. I don't know how he did those things, but he was an architect. He just died recently. Miro was another one of my favorites. There's a Miro lithograph and those are wonderful. This is an original woodcut by Utamaro, a very famous Japanese print maker.    Mr. Saretzky: Well, Sol, thank you very much. I guess we probably ought to stop at this point. I want to think you for sharing your memories with me. I've really enjoyed this talk very much.    Mr. Libsohn: Well, I enjoyed talking. Whatever value it has.     Mr. Saretzky: I'm sure that people who read your words in the future will really find you most interesting as one of the representatives of the 20th century. I'm very glad that you've been included in this project.    Mr. Libsohn: Thank you.       
MonmouthCounty;Schultz and Wenner;1911;1999;Schultz and Wenner, 1911, 1999          Remembering The 20th Century: An Oral History of Monmouth County    Date of Interview: July 27, 1999  Name of Interviewer: Flora Higgins  Premises of Interview: Ocean Grove, NJ  Birth dates of subjects:  Richard Wenner: N/A                                                     Benjamin Schultz: March 9, 1911     Ms. Higgins: Mr. Schultz, you've had a lifetime involvement in pharmacy, and one of the highlights of that lifetime is your efforts at poison control. Would you tell us a little bit about that effort?    Mr. Schultz: It started in 1952 outside the New York City Health Department. It came to the awareness of the pharmaceutical profession that children would die in great numbers. It was a sickness that started right after World War II. It was due to the sweetening of aspirin tablets, baby aspirin.  St. Joseph's put it out.  More children died from baby aspirin than diphtheria, scarlet fever, measles, whooping cough, and polio combined.  I worked with Dr. Morton Rodman, who was the Professor of Pharmacology at Rutgers University, and we developed a chart in category form of the toxic ingredients in household chemicals, such as furniture polish, cleaning fluids, Clorox -- all the things that people use for household things. And in those days, the toxic ingredients didn't have to be put on the label, so where did you get information? So, this is the project of Dr. Rodman and myself. We put it in categories. We could identify about 100,000 chemicals around the home.  Believe it or not, but each one has a different brand name. I remember a baby who swallowed Parker's Fountain Pen Ink.  They called up the emergency room.  We extended these Poison Control Centers to the Jersey Shore Medical Center.  At that time, it was called Fitkin Hospital.  Also, we extended them to Monmouth Memorial Hospital, Monmouth Medical Center, and there was another hospital, Riverview Hospital, what they call Riverview Medical Center today.  We sent an old index card file with all the different items to the emergency rooms, because there were not computers in those days. And if it wasn't on the index file, I would get calls in the middle of the night and the morning. I remember eating supper at home, and Robin, or my other daughter, Leona, would say, "Daddy, they want you in the hospital." I knew what it was. They wanted to know what the toxic ingredient in certain chemicals involved. Well, I had my master list.  I would tell them sometimes you could pump the stomach or you could give an enema.  With some substances you couldn't give an enema, because the fumes, like the petroleum products, all those fumes, that included the cleaning fluids, would get into the lungs, and they would cause low bile pneumonia and, of course, the patients would pass away, not from the toxic substances but from the fumes. So, we had to teach them how to use things with the tube and wash out the stomach and all that other stuff that goes with it.    Ms. Higgins: Did you get any help from the county government?    Mr. Schultz: No. It wasn't around in those days. We did it all independently and it emanated from us.  At that time, we had the blessings from the Monmouth County Medical Society and the Monmouth County Society of Pharmacists.  I was the key coordinator and I had the burden, but it was a labor of love. I'll tell you one little incident. It happened with little Joey who was two years old in Long Branch, NJ.  His mother was pregnant again, and she was taking prenatal capsules once a day as ordered by the doctor. And all of a sudden, she looked at the bottle, and  it was half-empty. Little Joey had swallowed a lot of prenatal capsules, which contain iron. Iron is very toxic to a young child. We didn't have an antidote for iron, once it was in the blood. We didn't have the chelating agent. There was a Dr. Press from Belmar, NJ, a pediatrician who went to the University of Chicago Medical School, and he had developed a formula, which given intravenously, drip by drip, would be an adjoining agent and take out all the excess iron from the blood. I called Dr. Press. I said, "Give us the formula fast. I have a child who is in a coma!"  We did it, and six days later the hospital called me and said, "Little Joey is out of the coma," and I still get a thrill down my back when I hear it -- "Little Joey is out of the coma!"  Little Joey now is about fifty-five years old, walking the streets.  But we in Monmouth County started poison control with the three hospitals. There wasn't any other place in the United States.  All the fifty states have poison control now.  Now we have a center open 24 hours a day at Saint Barnabus Hospital in Newark for the entire state. Most drug stores today have that 800 poison control number, and it is opened 24 hours a day with a pharmacist and a physician in charge.    Ms. Higgins: Do they get a lot of calls from people who were unaware of what's going on regarding medication or something related to that?    Mr. Schultz: Overdose and drug regimen, yes, that also is included now.    Ms. Higgins: So it's narcotics as well.    Mr. Schultz: Anything that has to do with the cause of death of any human being.    Ms. Higgins: Who takes these calls?     Mr. Schultz: There is either a pharmacist who answers the phone, or a physician.  Sometimes they have to have a combination. Of course, they also have to tell the hospital how to treat the patient, whether they give an emetic or drain the stomach out, you know, a stomach tube and all this other stuff of washing the stomach out.  And, of course, some medications are depressants, and the patient must have a stimulant to keep him or her alive.  That is the whole process with the poison control. And now it is in all fifty states. In Arizona, we have trouble with poisonous snakes. We don't have any in New Jersey. (Laughter)    Ms. Higgins: So you can make calls about poisonous snake bites?    Mr. Schultz: Anything that would cause the death of an individual.    Ms. Higgins: When you go to school to be a pharmacist, do you learn all this?    Mr. Schultz: We take a course called toxicology.  I graduated from the College of Pharmacy in 1931, and that was sixty-eight years ago.  We took two years of toxicology, because most of the drugs and medications were poisonous. You're talking about arsenic, elixir quinine, and strychnine. Strychnine is poisonous. And a lot of the herbal remedies that are used today were all the official drugs. There were very few chemicals in the pharmacopoeia in those days. Today, they use them as alternative medicine.    Ms. Higgins: What is your opinion of St. John's Wort, for example?    Mr. Schultz: What do I think? How do they market it? I'll tell you how. They say because it is a nutritious substance, it is not under the jurisdiction of the Food and Drug Administration.  So, you take the medicine, mix it with prescription medicine and you could die. One hundred thousand people have died from drug related accidents.  Another way to say it is experimentation. Also with some prescription drugs there was a lot of drug interaction.    Ms. Higgins: Of course, there are even some foods that cause harmful drug interaction.     Mr. Schultz: Yes.    Ms. Higgins: Are you a pharmacist, Mr. Wenner?      Mr. Schultz: No, he was in drug rehabilitation. This also was developed in Monmouth County before it went nationwide.    Ms. Higgins: Has Monmouth County over the past century been aggressive with narcotics rehabilitation? How did you get that established?    Mr. Schultz: I had my first discourse with Joe Irwin in 1966 or 1969.  The Monmouth Board established an interim drug committee, and I was on that committee, to advise the Board on the promotion, development, establishment, and coordination of unified programs for the prevention, diagnosis, treatment, rehabilitation, and control of drug addiction.    Ms. Higgins: How did you know there were drugs in the county? Mr. Irwin once said there was no problem.  He was from Middletown wasn't he?    Mr. Schultz: He changed his mind. I think he also had a boat business or something.    Ms. Higgins: I remember Mr. McCarthy was the chief of the Middletown Police. And he also affirmed there were no drugs in Middletown.      Mr. Schultz:  I taught thirty police departments in Monmouth County, and we had them combined.  I gave them lectures on the controlled drugs. The Federal laws came out about controlled drugs that were addicting and all this other stuff. I had to teach thirty-five police departments.  I taught the police.  They didn't know about drug raids. This was new to them.    Ms. Higgins: You mean information about controlled substances like marijuana and cocaine.    Mr. Schultz: You got that right. Cocaine is legal. It is still legal, unlike illegal marijuana or heroin.  The Federal Narcotic Act came into effect in 1910. It had the narcotic laws.  Then later on, Hubert Humphrey, who, by the way, was a pharmacist besides being Vice President and a senator from Minnesota, and Durham, who was a congressman from North Carolina, created the Humphrey-Durham act, which clarified two classes of drugs in the United States. One for which you had to get a prescription and the other that you can buy over-the-counter with the proper labeling. Until then, there was no control over the drug traffic, I mean the patented medicine market. Lydia Pinkham Tonic is an example.    Ms. Higgins: I remember buying elixir of terpinhydrate and codeine right over the counter.    Mr. Schultz: That was official to sign for it always. Before it became elixir terpinhydrate and codeine, it was elixir terpinhydrate and heroin.    Ms. Higgins: Really?    Mr. Schultz: That's right. And in those days, they found out that heroin was more addicting than any of those narcotics.  It is part of the opium group, you understand? So, codeine you could control and you had to sign for elixir terpinhydrate and codeine. And pharmacists could not sell more than a bottle of those types of cough medicines to any one person within a certain time frame.  Then, later on, we got drugs that weren't addicting, like dexamorphon, as they called it then, that eliminated some of the problems. But we had addicts that used to go from one drug store to the other buying elixir of terpinhydrate and codeine.    Ms. Higgins: How about the phase of cleaning fluid highs in the 1950s?      Mr. Schultz:   Kids used to get high on the vapors, the solvent of the cleaning things. And if it's in a closed area, you can asphyxiate yourself. They used to put a hood over their heads and they thought they'd get the euphoric effect they wanted. They got it all right. Some were lucky and some were not. Then they used to put a big plastic bag over their head. We tried to educate the public, and this effort stemmed from me and the Monmouth County Pharmaceutical Society working with the Monmouth County Board that later on became known as the Monmouth County Board of Alcohol and Drug Abuse Services.    Mr. Wenner: The Monmouth County Board that established the Interim Drug Committee on October 18, 1966. So that is the official original date that you can document the beginning of a public effort in the county, outside the pharmaceutical association, which was known as the MOPS, the Monmouth Ocean Pharmaceutical Society.    Mr. Schultz: That's right. It was a bi-county organization.    Mr. Wenner: Two counties combined. They were the leaders at that time in the education about controlled drugs and drug abuse.    Ms. Higgins: The pharmacists. They were seeing the results of drug abuse.    Mr. Wenner: Exactly, in their drug stores.  They got to know first hand working with the police because the police and pharmacists worked together. They got to see the problem spreading, so they really could take credit, along with narcotics officers, for giving this the attention it deserved. Then after four years of working with the police department, as Mr. Schultz said, other pharmacists and professionals, through the Monmouth Ocean Pharmaceutical Society and the police departments that wanted to cooperate, on September 1, 1970, the Board of Chosen Freeholders appointed a permanent committee of residents to further the work of narcotics control and treatment to be known as the Monmouth County Narcotics Council. Now for the record, I am just going through the types of people who were important.  The members appointed were: George Bartell, who was a Monmouth Medical Center Hospital Official  Eleanor Luhrs, who was a citizen, but she happened to be a nurse  Edwin P. Gage, who was a real estate executive  Earl B. Garrison, who was the County Superintendent of Schools and a former high school principal  Benjamin Schultz, a pharmacist  Thomas Totural, a school principal at the high school level  William P. Gannon, a business man  Dr. Rose C. Thomas, a professor  Robert N. Goger, a drug abuse worker  Robert Ansell, Esq., an attorney from Asbury Park  Robert S. Newman, a probation officer  Dr. Sandra Wolman, another professor in the human sciences  Robert Benham, an executive  Norma Klein, a Brookdale College administrator  Dr. Sid Leventhal, a psychiatrist  Frank Espolota from law enforcement.  Benjamin Schultz was elected by this group as the first chairman of the Narcotics Council in 1970.  I want to say this group comprised a wide range of citizens from various fields, which I think is the reason for the success they had.  It included a lot of people with a lot of good minds.    Ms. Higgins: Was it one of the first times that a private sector had worked with the political body?    Mr. Schultz: Yes, in that field.    Mr. Wenner: Yes. There is a history of that. The history would be the nursing field, where Geraldine Thompson started, on her own, a private nursing organization.  Later, they had to go public for the funding, because they didn't have enough nurses.    Mr. Schultz: This was the first organized attempt between the citizens of the county and the officials of the county.  They created a structured attempt among physicians, pharmacists, nurses and schools to provide education, both for prevention and treatment and all the other things.  Funding could be channeled and be responsible, because the Board itself monitored all the grant money given them: Federal money, state money, and the county money all went to the Monmouth County Board of Drug Abuse Service.    Ms. Higgins: Would you say that proportionately there is less drug use in 1999 in Monmouth County than in 1970, or was there less in 1970?    Mr. Schultz: Well, I can't answer that because I have been out of the statistical field, but I will say this, we forgot one little aspect, the social drugs that were never on the list. For instance cigarettes.  Tobacco supporters are still talking from -- what do the Indians say?  "Talking with forked tongue, from both sides of the mouth."  But you have to look at the other side of the coin. We need money for social programs. Stop kidding ourselves. The cigarette industry is a lot of money.  Prohibition was repealed back in the Roosevelt days. We regulated the alcohol industry. You don't hear too much about it, and they still talk about their limitations. Alcohol is one of the biggest social drugs. That is another social drug we are talking about. Nicotine and alcohol. What other things? How many cups of coffee do you drink a day?  There are drug interactions involved. These are exempted because they tax the dickens out of it, and they needed extra money to fund the social programs. So what do you do, you want to kill the golden goose that feeds the different organizations? And then you've got to walk a tight line.     Ms. Higgins: So now alcohol is included in the Monmouth County Board of Drug Abuse Service?    Mr. Schultz: Oh, yes.    Mr. Wenner: Yes, that came later. Let's just go back. The members of the Board of Chosen Freeholders at the time of the 1970 establishment were Joseph C. Irwin, Director, and Axel Carlson.  Harry Larrison, Jr., of Ocean Grove was a member of the Board. Albert Allen of Aberdeen Township, and Ernest Kavalek of Middletown completed the then five-member Board of Freeholders, who saw the wisdom of appointing this group. The interesting thing that occurred was that, due to the professional experience and other widespread experience that they were willing to appoint to this counsel, within five months, this group headed by Mr. Schultz convinced the board that they should hire a staff to work on this. I want to say for the record, this was a record time. This was a very conservative county at the time, with a very conservative group of Freeholders.  They didn't spend money freely. For them to come up with a full-time paid individual within five months shows their faith in the group that they appointed, and they were buying what the group was saying, that there was a problem, and they met it very quickly. So we can't be critical. We may be critical for the early stages of being closed to the situation, but they certainly adapted very quickly, and it within five months funded a staff and a full budget for the group.    Ms. Higgins: Which has worked without interruption to this day, 1999.    Mr. Wenner: That's correct. Until today. In 1977, the Freeholders changed the name of the group to the Monmouth County Board of Drug Abuse Services, which it still is today. In 1984, the Freeholders created the Citizen's Advisory Committee for Alcoholism Services. So some seven years later, they began to include alcoholism in the overall work of that group. Finally, the two groups were merged in 1988 to create the Monmouth County Board of Alcohol and Drug Abuse Services.  Mr. Schultz was very instrumental in the pressure on the Freeholders.  He was the chairman, but he was also the most outspoken in terms of the need.  The others did not have the background in the street, nor in the pharmacy, of seeing the results, firsthand along with the police department. So, he had the best vantage point and took the lead.  They all supported him and it was funded in 1970.    Ms. Higgins: During all this time, you continued to work as a pharmacist?    Mr. Schultz: Making a living.    Ms. Higgins: That's quite a heritage to leave now that you have gone to Arizona to do good things.  You have created poison control first of all, and then the narcotics and drug awareness programs.    Mr. Schultz: And they still continue today.      Richard Wenner, 1971  Mr. Wenner: There is one thing that Mr. Schultz left out. Back in the early days, which I got to know as the first director of the Narcotics Council in 1971, and that is the early days of the poison control, the pharmacist used puppets and cartoons to educate young children very effectively. We incorporated that into the work of the Narcotics Counsel and we had a great deal of success because right away we were able to reach young children. It is one thing to turn the older kids and stop them from using or get them into rehab. It is another thing to prevent the core group that is coming up from starting, and this group did that very effectively with the cartoons and puppets.    Ms. Higgins: I think I may be sitting with the gentleman who helped me quit smoking.  In the 1960s, my daughters were in the Highlands Public School, and they were shown a lot of these kinds of things about damage from cigarette smoke. The girls came home and begged and begged me to stop smoking. It was finally easier to quit smoking than listen to the children anymore, and I thank you for it. That was very effective.    Mr. Wenner: I can tell you, I was there at the Highlands Public School. I can give you the names of all the people. The mayor was a pharmacist by the way. This was  Richard A. Stryker, who had a pharmacy in Atlantic Highlands.  But he was at the school. He kicked off that program at the Highlands School because I was there representing, and we got those articles, including nonsmoking, into the school at that time, in that year.  Jim White was Mayor of Highlands.  Richard A. Stryker was a MOPS, who had worked under Ben. Even though he went forward with this group, he still had his Monmouth Ocean Pharmaceutical Society Group, and Stryker was the regional man in Atlantic Highlands, which is how he got us in the schools, and Jim Snynder was there too, as well as Buddy Bahrs.  These were the famous people who were there to kick off the Highlands and Atlantic Highlands Initiative.  They were both local officials.      Ms. Higgins: Mr. Schultz, tell us something about Highlands and clam digging.    Mr. Schultz: Well, I never dug clams, but I used to go crabbing in the Pleasure Bay and get crabs.    Ms. Higgins: And you could eat them then? For a long time you couldn't.    Mr. Schultz: Yes.  We used to get the crabs in Pleasure Bay and get a whole bag full, and then we'd get a big pot to boil them in. We'd boil them until  we'd see a red color. I said, "Now we can eat the crabs."  We had to boil them.  I wouldn't want to eat a raw crab or even a clam. Steamed ones I'll eat, but I won't eat a raw clam the way the waters are.    Mr. Wenner: There have only been four administrators over a twenty-eight-year period, and there is no other organization in the county that has had that continuity of administration. There was myself in 1971-77  Gregory C. Ulrich, who is deceased, 1977-86  Charles D. Brown in 1986-88  and Barry Johnson from 1986 to the present. So, there is a great deal of stability in a board that had had only four administrators in twenty-eight years.    Ms. Higgins: You mentioned something of the educational work that the Board does. What if you're confronted with some teenagers who have a drug problem or who have been arrested for dealing?  Is that also within the jurisdiction of the Board?    Mr. Schultz: Now for instance, the changing structure of a family life. We need two salaries in order to support a family. This is both part of the Board too. I think it was Ocean Township High School that got the first grant. School lets out at 3:00 pm and there's nobody home to supervise. So, we funded supervision at the Ocean Township High School from 3:00 to 6:00 pm. The teachers would get paid by the Board, which would give funds to the Board of Education budget. It had nothing to do with the school budget. We funded them to supervise the children.  They had to be in the auditorium or someplace where they could do their homework or something else, while being supervised by a teacher, who was paid for the three hours by the Board.    Ms. Higgins: Good prevention there.    Mr. Schultz: The idea was prevention. We looked at the picture. You have a lot of churches here and synagogues, and God knows, whatever.    Ms. Higgins: Is there anything further you would like to say about the poison control project?    Mr. Schultz: The State Poison Control Project is now coordinated at St. Barnabus Hospital, and all the hospitals know that if there is any overdose or any poison emergency to call St. Barnabus.  Senior Citizens now have a lot of drug related problems due to drug interactions.    Ms. Higgins: So you have moved from identifying poisons to identifying these interactions you see, because a lot of people are on a lot of medications?    Mr. Schultz: Drug intervention, yes.  I took a survey of the lifestyle habits of senior citizens, which was published in 1983 in the New Jersey Journal of Pharmacy.  How many smoked cigarettes, how many had a drink, or drank, the listing of the so-called social drugs, and also the medications. But, we formed another thing. We call it Project SPIRIT.  I got a group of retired and semi-retired pharmacists together. It's an acronym for Senior Pharmacists in Retirement in Transition.  Our target was senior citizens, who take more medications than the rest of the population. Aging is not a disease, but you can develop diabetes, heart trouble, asthma, bronchitis, and many other things. We had the first brown bag program in the United States. They used to bring their pills in a bag and come to the Senior Citizen complexes where we had six or seven pharmacists, who asked the people, "How do you take this and how do you take that? This is eighteen years old. Do you take this anymore? No? Why don't you throw it away?  Drugs deteriorate."  So, we had to educate the seniors. You can't play around with drugs.  It's just like in today's newspaper with the front page: A woman took one of these nutrition things that's for sleeping or something like that.  It caused her death. And now they are going to have an autopsy. But they pinpoint her because three or four people have the same drug. This is the trouble with our laws. Congress passes laws, but they're not complete. Little by little, we are adding on to the problems, and we've got a society that likes to experiment.    Ms. Higgins: You think people take too many pills?    Mr. Schultz: Some do, yes.    Ms. Higgins: I worked in a pharmacy. I was convinced that everyone in America was constipated.     Mr. Schultz: Senior citizens, especially.    Ms. Higgins: Well, it was really quite an experience.    Mr. Schultz: That is because of their style of life.  They sit in a rocking chair all day long, they don't walk. We don't expect them to run 100 yards and do aerobic dancing, come on. You can't take the pace. But, you can do it within your limitations.     Ms. Higgins: Would you tell me something about the war years here in the county?    Mr. Schultz: It was a question of my younger brother going into the Army or me. Of course, we had to enroll in the draft and at that time, my younger brother wasn't married yet, and I was married. I got married in 1937, and if they closed my drug store, there would be no drug store in all the borough. There was no drug store in Deal or Oakhurst, and there was no drug store in Elberon, either.  What are you going to do when you needed a prescription? Then we had after hours. See now, we have a little sign in some of the drug stores about after hours pharmacies.  I started that too.  We work with the Police Departments. In case somebody needed an emergency prescription, they would call the local police department, which would have their numbers.  They would come and open their store, but the cop would come at the same time. Why? We had fellows with maybe a small gun but it looked like a cannon when they used to shove it in your belly. That happened once or twice. So not only do you call us, you want a cop there when the prescription is filled and make sure everything is okay. That was part of the after hour prescription plan, which was endorsed by the Monmouth County Board of Alcohol and Drug abuse. It was teamwork by everyone.    Ms. Higgins: Did you get down to the seashore much?    Mr. Schultz: I lived at the seashore in Deal.  We have a beach casino, one of the biggest along the coast.    Ms. Higgins: It's not gambling?    Mr. Schultz: No, we just called it Deal Beach Casino. I think it's four blocks long, and then the Phillips Avenue Beach, the big end, is free. The back you had to pay for. The lockers, and all, and the pool. We had an oversized pool, bigger than an Olympic pool, and this daughter of mine learned how to swim there.     Ms. Higgins: You were too busy with the Pharmaceutical Society?    Mr. Schultz: No, I did go too, but I found out years ago that I couldn't take the sun. I was so sensitive. When I married, we went on our honeymoon to Miami. We took a dose of Miami Beach. We went into the hotel and I signed up. We got on the beach and I got a big umbrella. I was about a half an hour on the beach. I get back into the hotel room, and I swelled up like a balloon. So, we called, and asked for the Miami, Florida doctor who came and looked. He said, "You've got sun poisoning." I said, "But I wasn't in direct sun."  He said, "You are very sensitive to the sun."  From then on, I was never a sun worshipper. They could get tanned, and browned and green and yellow, but I couldn't.    Ms. Higgins: But what about sun shield?      Mr. Schultz: They didn't have those.  I got to a point where I said, "What do I want to play around for?"    Ms. Higgins: You know, actually, you have a very youthful look to you. I wouldn't be surprised if keeping out of the sun is a part of that.    Mr. Schultz: I see people my age and don't push it.    Ms. Higgins: I see people twenty years younger than you who look older.    Mr. Schultz: And they are all wrinkled and everything else. It is all caused by the sun. You see people who worked outdoors, and it's the elements.     Ms. Higgins: Tell me about Project SPIRIT again.  What is the acronym?     Mr. Schultz: SPIRIT: Senior Pharmacists In Retirement In Transition.  We used to go to Senior Citizen clubs, nutrition centers and the high rise apartments, the HUD senior housing, where they take disabled people because of the federal requirement  90% were senior citizens.  So, we took all that and we did our programs all over the county: Belmar, Middletown,  etc.  They had six or seven of those senior complexes.  They brown bagged all the stuff. I worked with Boy Scouts, too.    Ms. Higgins: What do you mean, "Brown Bag?"     Mr. Schultz: They took all the medications  they took over-the-counter, nonprescription, and prescription drugs, and brought them down to us,  and then we would ask them, "How did the doctor tell you to take this?  Did they tell you to take it before meals? After meals? What foods are you to avoid?  Do you know about the drug and food interaction?"  We taught them medication planning.     Ms. Higgins: So, you could look at a person's bag of pills and make recommendations?    Mr. Schultz: And some of them were very outdated.  They had big bags.    Ms. Higgins: And you knew right away what they were?    Mr. Schultz: Oh, yes, and if they were outdated, anything that was filled two years and you hadn't had it refilled you'd throw it away, because that could be a problem.    Ms. Higgins: That certainly is a consciousness raising program.     Mr. Schultz: And it is still going on today in the United States and more and more pharmaceutical groups are doing it.  The Dean from the University of Arizona College of Pharmacy said the figure of drug-related accidents amounts to $76 billion dollars a year. That means a fall, breaking a leg, it all started with the drug that was mistakenly taken.  So we have to educate the public now. This is a new role, not roll pills or capsules. That is the scene of pharmacy today.    Ms. Higgins: Please tell us about the File for Life.  Is there anything like that in Monmouth County?       Benjamin Schultz with Middletown Police Explorers, 1988  Mr. Schultz: The File of Life is like the Vial for Life that I did with the American Red Cross. The fact sheet is the same. The principle is also the same. The fact sheet contains emergency information about you for anyone who has to enter your home.  It contains information about your doctor, the medications you take, the nearest relative, your medical condition, health insurances, advance directives, health care, power of attorney, and living wills.    Ms. Higgins: Who keeps this file? Is it at the police department or at a hospital?      Benjamin Schultz (seated middle) instructing seniors about medication  Mr. Schultz: No, it hasn't reached that yet.  You have to ask for a new fact sheet in case the status changes,  because over time you may develop a new disease, angina  for instance.  Well, the File of Life is good for everybody, but we are directing it towards seniors now. Aging is not a disease, but it invites disease. Over time, you get new diseases and new medications and taking the old medications with it. Some of them take seventeen, eighteen, twenty pills a day. They don't know how to manage their medication, that is when you get your overdoses and so forth and so on.  It is a long process, and Steve Gross, who is the Dean of the Pharmacy in Long Island University, explains it.  100,000 die from drug-related causes, and we spend seventy-six point six billion dollars a year.  What is our role now?  Drugs are starting to treat diseases you never could think of.  When I got married in 1937 and wanted to take out insurance, the life span of an individual was only fifty-five years. Today, a baby born will live to be in the middle seventies, and the women used to outlive us by eight years, but in those days the women didn't smoke, or drink, or take some of the other social drugs. But now they are going to be executives in our economy. Chief executive officers of big companies are women, and so they have to have the three martini lunch.    Ms. Higgins: That is another thing about drugs. You can beware of drug reactions, but if you take a beer, that could throw everything into an uproar.    Mr. Schultz: I'd hate to give you the list of alcoholic beverages that react with medications. But everybody says, "Well, one drink ain't going to hurt."  You take a sleeping pill and take a nap. I'd hate to tell you how many actors and actresses forgot to wake up the next morning.  You know as well as I know, you have a big list. That is part of my play that I rewrote.    Ms. Higgins: Your play?    Mr. Schultz: It's In The Cards, and they are doing it today, but I can't be in two places at one time, or I would have been there watching them. It is a twenty minute play.  There is a pharmacist there who talks about the medication with alcohol and with some of the other things.    Ms. Higgins: So, it is educational as well as entertaining.    Mr. Schultz: Very much so.    Ms. Higgins: Where is your play being played today?    Mr. Schultz: In Howell Township. I can give you a place.    Ms. Higgins:  What are some of your more significant memories of the County? Has it changed much?     Mr. Schultz: In Ocean Grove proper, I've never seen so much building done in the summer time, and rebuilding. Every week. Not across the street here but every little block, there are two or three. To me, Ocean Grove is a fire trap  just one big thing and the whole city would come down, but at least they've got prevention. But they are building up.  We took a ride to see Asbury Park, which was the key city when I first came down here during the Depression.  Cookman Avenue was a busy drive. There were no malls. There were no other things that changed the shopping habits for people. They all came into Asbury Park to shop at stores like Steinbachs.  Today, they are all empty buildings.  We took a ride down to Steinbachs.  If you shot a cannon, nobody would even bother you. Where else did we go?  Ocean Avenue Boardwalk.  It used to be a lot of what we have in Bradley Beach and Belmar. The little shops, you know, but they were all gone. All the rides are gone.      Ms. Higgins: We went down there in the 1950s with the children and it was a lot of fun.     Mr. Schultz: Miniature golf, they used to have the Susie van come down, you know play on the top of the one side.    Ms. Higgins: Have you taken a trip to Red Bank?    Mr. Schultz: Red Bank, yes.  I used to go to Red Bank all the time.  The little businesses add a personal touch. You went to a Red Bank Store, they knew every customer by his name.    Ms. Higgins: Probably knew his prescriptions by heart, too?    Mr. Schultz: I knew, and I would tell them, and I would counsel them at the same time. But I was maybe a little different. We did a lot of compounding in those days. We had a drug store in Allenhurst.  Mayor Hague of Jersey City came down there.    Ms. Higgins: Mayor Hague?    Mr. Schultz: Sure, he had a home on Deal Esplanade.    Ms. Higgins: Some of the presidents used to come here too.    Mr. Schultz: Right after the Civil War. Now, Long Branch was going down and Asbury Park was taking all of the business.    Ms. Higgins: Do you see Long Branch picking up?    Mr. Schultz: Very much so, and Hilton just started. They built a promenade instead of the wooden boards and it goes a mile and a half until it gets to the public beach.  It's lovely. They fixed it so it won't wash away, at least the promenade won't.  The Army engineers are going fourteen miles out, dig up sand, and put it on the beach here. I remember when Ocean Grove on Sundays had a big chain that went right across the entrance road.  You couldn't ride, you had to walk.  And all the cars would be out on Main Street, and in all of Asbury Park.  In  Deal you have the Guggenheims, the Salemans, the Lehmans. Heck, Monmouth College was sold for taxes.  Annie, the movie, was filmed at Monmouth College. There was also a girls school, a finishing school there, and I went there, and I got all their business. When I first walked in there, I hate to tell you, faucets were made out of gold, not brass, gold fixtures.  They had a swimming pool downstairs.    Ms. Higgins: A lot of wealthy people would come here.      Benjamin Schultz, standing right, in front of his drug store  Mr. Schultz: Very wealthy. When I first came in the 1930s and I had my drug store -- well, it wasn't so little in those days, it was big.  Today, a drug store is a mini-mart  some even handle milk and cheese and things.  They played polo in Deal.  Lehman from that little square behind.. real horses, a real polo field.  Later on, they played it out in the west portion of the county.    Ms. Higgins: They play it in Colts Neck now.    Mr. Schultz: But I am talking about when I first came down in the 1930s.  They all played polo.  Lehman Avenue and North Avenue was a big polo field, it was three blocks square, and they played polo for fun.    Ms. Higgins: How would they get down here?    Mr. Schultz: On Monmouth Road, they had horse stables.    Ms. Higgins: That is certainly a different flavor.    Mr. Schultz: And even on Roosevelt Avenue, we had one horse stable that went all the way back to the brook.  Where the veterinary hospital is today, there used to be a horse stable.  and on West Down Heister, there was a horse stable, too.  The so-called class played polo and a lot of them moved out to the end of the county, to Colts Neck and other places.  I'll give you an example. The Leads, who had Manhattan Shirt Company, bought a stretch during the War.  You're talking about the War years. They wanted to live in a certain style. They bought Middlebrook. There were no Middlebrook apartments  it was a farm.  They incorporated the farm, they grew vegetables. They had servants and everything else needed in a big house.  The corporation paid all the help.    Ms. Higgins: They probably got farm assistance, too?    Mr. Schultz: Sure, being a farm, you get the pre-tax. There are ways of circumventing, no matter who was legislating.    Ms. Higgins: My first interview was a farmer who was trying to tell me all about how some people would use this to make more money.    Mr. Schultz: You take Shore Dairy with a Pollack.  He had show dogs.  He was a dairy farmer.  Because of his connections, all the milk that he got was sold to all the hospitals.  Now, there is Monmouth Memorial Hospital Board.  There was another little hospital called East Hazlet Hospital. But, all the milk and all the business and the puppies and, of course in those days they delivered milk to your door. Today they don't do it.     Ms. Higgins: I can remember when we lived in Middletown, they delivered milk and eggs, and the Dugan Bakery would come.    Mr. Schultz: That's right to the door. I used to get a fellow from Lakewood. He would make his route to all the good people in Deal.  We had a chicken farm. They brought fresh eggs from the farm. You'd get two dozen this week, a dozen this week, according to how you ate the eggs.  Don't want to eat too many eggs with the yolk in it with the cholesterol.  That was before Welsh Farms. Then we stopped.  Borden, Sheffield, used to deliver milk too. They don't deliver anymore, but Welsh Farms still does it.    Ms. Higgins: Mr. Schultz, as we approach the end of the century, what would you like to say about Monmouth County History?      Mr. Schultz: People are getting older. Our population is growing older. It used to be only nine or ten percent.  The fact is that the population is growing older  I think Federal legislation has to help older people.  An active man should be allowed to work without anyone penalizing him if he took his Social Security at age sixty.  You have to permit them to work until age seventy.  You may have to increase the retirement age to seventy or sixty-five.  It is happening now, federal legislation, but step by step. You can't do it all at once or you disrupt the entire country.  Grow old gracefully, and maintain a quality life. Sure, I got high blood pressure, I had it for forty years. I didn't get it over-night, but I still walk.  Walk all the time.  My daughter takes me down to Belmar to the Arcade to play kids games that used to be in the Asbury Park Boardwalk.  They pulled out the carousel.  The family structure is changing too. I see if you want to buy your own home, and that's the idea, it can't be done by a one-income family.  They both work. Now you have to find out how you establish day care.  It is already here. They both work. They both come home and pick up the kids. The husband no longer sits at home and says, "You've got to do the dishes."  It is a two way street. Give and take in life, and that is how it should be.    Ms. Higgins: Is there anything else you'd like to say?  I have enjoyed talking with you so very much!    Mr. Schultz: There are so many things in this head of mine. What do I say? Charles Brown was the first director of the Monmouth County Board of Alcohol and Drug Abuse, but then the county health board needed a new administrator  because he could handle money, he is now director of the Monmouth County Mental Health Board.    Ms. Higgins: How about some final comments on the cooperation between county and state government and private organizations? You were apparently a pioneer in that. Did you find Monmouth County pretty progressive along those lines?    Mr. Schultz: The Federal government realized we were condemning cigarettes way far back.  So now, they still can't put the cigarette industry out of business. All they said to the Federal government was, "Cut us down in the United States, but give us a free hand globally.  The Muslims must smoke a lot of tobacco. Europeans all smoke cigarettes. Let us have that market."  They all like American cigarettes, the combination of Turkish and domestic, and the same thing goes with cigars. They exempted cigars.  Cigars are just as habit forming and just as dangerous as cigarettes  the coal tar goes into your lungs and causes cancer. It's a new ballgame, and they will have to experiment like we did. I lived through maybe eight decades.  I saw a whole century of change from the radio in the early days to the TV set.  We thought TV would put movies out of business, but they are still making money. They adapt movies for TV.  And the same thing goes with computers. Mr. Microsoft, smart Gates has got the control because he has control of all the software, not the computer itself.  They had the antitrust act in existence since the railroad days.  They had to put some minor changes to it so no one individual has control, so there is competition. With competition you have no problem.    Ms. Higgins: Well, I am hearing a message from you that we should encourage competition, which this country seems to do.    Mr. Schultz: And they tried.  Don't kill the small guy.    Ms. Higgins: Your comments about encouraging people to work longer are thought-provoking, also.    Mr. Schultz: Have a retirement age, and at least don't penalize them because they are growing older.    Ms. Higgins: I am so glad to have to talked with you. I really am. Thank you very much for contributing to our archive. 
MonmouthCounty;Sarah Ellison;1915;2000;Sarah Ellison, 1915, 2000              Remembering The 20th Century: An Oral History of Monmouth County      Sarah Ellison, present day  Date of Interview: August 1, 2000   Name of Interviewer: Douglas Aumack  Premises of Interview: Ms. Ellison's home, Matawan, NJ  Birthdate of Subject: November 22, 1915  Deceased: October 19, 2002    Mr. Aumack: When did you come to Monmouth County, and why did you come to Monmouth County?    Ms. Ellison: We came down to Monmouth County in 1920 because my father wanted his family to be down in the country. We came from Newark. He still had his job in Newark, so he did commute. We lived in Keyport, where the trolley was the transportation until 1925. The trolley ceased running then. There was a bus, but it was not as convenient as the trolley. It was on a different street. So we moved to Matawan to be near the railroad station. The transportation in Matawan was better. So we lived where he could walk to the railroad station every day.      Sarah Higbie (Ellison) in 1917, at the age of two    Mr. Aumack: Now what was your father's job?    Ms. Ellison: I think today they would call it an electrical engineer. He was into electricity when electricity was new. Then when the Depression came along in the 1930s, he lost his job. Oh, that was a big step for us. We lived through the Depression, and we lived in Matawan. And he got odd jobs.    Mr. Aumack: What kind of odd jobs?    Ms. Ellison: Oh, he did different things. He worked for a coal company, he worked as a truck driver one time, and then finally he got a job in Newark as an elevator operator. He did that for awhile. Later on, when building resumed, he did go back into the electrical business. But by that time, in 1940, I was married. So I did not live home anymore.    Mr. Aumack: From 1930 to 1940, he held a lot of different jobs.    Ms. Ellison: He did. He held different jobs, anything he could get because during the Depression, it was very bad.    Mr. Aumack: Did your mom do anything during the Depression?    Ms. Ellison: No, mother stayed home.    Mr. Aumack: Do you remember the name of the coal or truck company that he worked for?    Ms. Ellison: Yes, I think it was Martin & Brown. It was a local company.    Mr. Aumack: Was that the coal or the trucking company?    Ms. Ellison: They did different things. It was trucking, and one of the things they did do besides trucking was also the coal business. They also did other things like lumber and different things.    Mr. Aumack: Was the coal and the trucking job both from the same company, Martin & Brown?    Ms. Ellison: Yes, well it was on a truck. They had trucks, and he just worked on the truck.    Mr. Aumack: Discuss the trolley. Where was it?    Ms. Ellison: Well, I think the trolley started down in Union Beach. It did run through Matawan, but I don't think it went to Freehold. We only used it to go to Matawan, so I don't know for sure. At the time, the trolley did go through Matawan, and it came up Main Street. Now it couldn't cross the railroad tracks. But at that time, when the trolley was running, there was a road that ran underneath the railroad tracks, and it's no longer there. Do you know anything about Matawan?    Mr. Aumack: No.    Ms. Ellison: Where Key Autobody is now, there used to be a road. But they have filled that road up with a parking lot now. But the trolley used to go down and around underneath the railroad tracks, and it came up by the Matawan Lake dam. And then it went through Matawan. But I don't think it went past Matawan. And I know it didn't go to Freehold, so it must have ended. It ended at what we call Freneau, which is south Matawan. It ended in the southern part of Matawan.    Mr. Aumack: Do you know why the trolley stopped?    Ms. Ellison: It probably was not paying, but I don't know why it stopped, really. But it must have had difficulties, and it did stop running.    Mr. Aumack: So it stopped in 1925.    Ms. Ellison: Yes, we moved to Matawan in 1925. It could've stopped in 1924. The bus service was not handy or as good as the trolley.    Mr. Aumack: One more question about the trolley. Did the railroad maybe have a hand in getting rid of the trolley?    Ms. Ellison: I don't think so. I really think it was for financial reasons.    Mr. Aumack: Ok.    Ms. Ellison: You know who is an expert on the trolleys? Maybe Pete Koelsch. He is on the Transportation Committee in Monmouth County. He would be more of an expert on transportation than me.    Mr. Aumack: How do you spell that last name?    Ms. Ellison: Koelsch, Peter Koelsch. I know he is on the Transportation Commission or Committee, whatever they call it.    Mr. Aumack: Thank you. Let's go back a bit. Do you know what company your father worked for when he was an electrical engineer?    Ms. Ellison: He worked for Westinghouse.    Mr. Aumack: Westinghouse!    Ms. Ellison: Westinghouse in Newark.    Mr. Aumack: Now you moved from Keyport to Matawan in 1925. Describe, if you can, what Keyport was like, if you remember it at all.    Ms. Ellison: Keyport was a very nice waterfront town. A lot of people lived along the Bay, and it was a nice place to live. It was a good residential area.    Mr. Aumack: Was it very big?    Ms. Ellison: No. It was a small town, like many of the towns here in Jersey.    Mr. Aumack: Was it very rural, Keyport?    Ms. Ellison: No, it sort of depended more on the water, I think. There were more fishermen. It was not farming, like Matawan. It was just residential. And the main industry was fishing, I think.    Mr. Aumack: Describe Matawan in 1925.    Ms. Ellison: Well, it was a small, rural town. The center of town had several streets on each side of Main Street. And then about three streets beyond were all farms. Of course the Township was mostly the farming part. And the Borough was the residential area.    Mr. Aumack: Oh, I see.    Ms. Ellison: Matawan Township was a large area. In the 1880s, maybe 1885 or 1886, the residents in the center of town decided to be free from the larger area, which was the Township. So they named themselves the Borough. Now Matawan Borough was surrounded by Matawan Township.     Mr. Aumack: When the developments came in, like Strathmore, did you live in Strathmore?     Ms. Ellison: No, I lived in Matawan. A lot of the people who came down to the developments were city people.    Mr. Aumack: New York City?    Ms. Ellison: Well, New York, Newark, or Jersey City. I knew a lot of people came from Staten Island, especially when they built the Verrazano Narrows Bridge.    Mr. Aumack: Do you remember what year that was?    Ms. Ellison: No, I don't remember. Maybe in the 1960s. When they built things like the bridges, it took whole neighborhoods out. I knew Lillian Burry, and I found out that many of her neighbors were from Staten Island. I said, "You've gotten your neighbors to move down with you." And she said, "Well, a lot of us were dispossessed when they built the Verrazano Bridge." So whole neighborhoods moved, and the people knew each other. But it was the people in the Township who decided these people were strangers. The people who moved down were not local farmers, because all the farmers had moved out. Now the farmers were content to be part of Matawan Township, but the people who moved down from New York were not satisfied with being part of the Township. So the name was changed to Aberdeen. The name Aberdeen goes back to the very first settlers. The first settlers in Matawan Township were Scots who were looking for religious freedom in 1686 or 1687. So these people who had moved down to Matawan Township did not want to be called Matawan anymore, because they felt that they were second-class citizens compared to Matawan Borough. And so they changed the name back to the original Scotch name, because the original settlers came from Aberdeen. So that's a little early history. Do you know the history of Matawan?    Mr. Aumack: Yes, I have heard of that story before.    Ms. Ellison: So you know that story then. Ok, I won't go through that.    Mr. Aumack: No, please go through that. Many people haven't heard it, so please go ahead and go through it. Now let me get a few things straight before you go on, please. Is what is now Aberdeen what used to be Matawan Township?    Ms. Ellison: Yes.    Mr. Aumack: Ok. And that used to be all farm area. And that was larger than Matawan Borough?    Ms. Ellison: Yes.    Mr. Aumack: What kinds of farms were in Matawan Township?    Ms. Ellison: Truck farms. The farmers sent their produce into market.    Mr. Aumack: Where did they send their produce to?    Ms. Ellison: New York City. There is a market up in New York where they all went.    Mr. Aumack: Fulton Street?    Ms. Ellison: Yes, I guess Fulton Street is where it is. I know there was a trucking company here, Van Brunts Trucking. The farmers depended on them, because they took the produce into market every night.    Mr. Aumack: Were there any animals on these farms?    Ms. Ellison: No. Maybe a horse or two that they used, but they didn't raise pigs or anything like that. It was mostly produce, vegetables.    Mr. Aumack: Matawan Borough separated from Matawan Township in the 1880s.    Ms. Ellison: Yes, about then.    Mr. Aumack: Why?     Ms. Ellison: They did not want to be associated with the farms. I guess they were a little bit snobbish!    Mr. Aumack: When did people start moving down from Staten Island, New York City, and Jersey City?    Ms. Ellison: When the developments came in, which would be in the 1960s.    Mr. Aumack: And most of these people settled in what is now Aberdeen?    Ms. Ellison: Yes. Matawan was fully built up. The developers bought up these truck farms in the Township. The Strathmore development was all Italian farmers out there, and now we have a big development of houses. And there was a farm where Marc Woods was built. And it was a farm there on the other side of town. All these developments coming in made it more people than farms, do you know what I mean? Now it is really not a farming community anymore. It changed the whole flavor of the place. Years ago, before the developments came in, Matawan had Main Street, which was like the village part. And all the farmers or people that lived on the outskirts, which would have been the Township, would have come into Matawan to shop. Now, we don't have downtown shopping the way it used to be, because of the malls and stores like Shop Rite and Grand Union. Those large stores are on the outside of town, out on the highway, and that's what sort of did in the downtown area. Now there is a drive going on to try and build up the downtown. But without a big grocery store or without a shopping mall downtown, you don't get people down there the way you used to. As I said, it changed the whole flavor of the area. Matawan is no longer the center of the village, because people do their shopping out on the highway. The grocery store that was downtown, or several of them, left because there was not enough business. People would rather go to a big shopping center out on the highway, on Route 34.    Mr. Aumack: Which stores were in the downtown area?    Ms. Ellison: The last one that went out was a co-op called Food Town. But when I was growing up, there was an American Store, which later became Acme. It was called American Store then, and it was a grocery store. Before that, there was a Butler's Store. And there was a meat market downtown, and it was called Dell's Meat Market. People would go there to buy their meat, and then they would go to the American Store to buy their groceries. Now you have these large places like Grand Union or Shop Right, and you can get everything in the same store. But years ago, you went to different stores to get everything you needed. I notice now that when you go over to Grand Union, you don't even have to go to the florist anymore. They have flowers there, besides all the vegetables. For fresh vegetables, you used to go out to one of the farm markets. Although I do remember men who came around with a horse and wagon and had vegetables for sale. They would be the farmers from outside of town, and they would come in to sell their vegetables. At one time, there was a man with a truck that had fish for sale. He probably picked up fish down at Keyport and went door-to-door selling them. He had people in town like my mother who always bought fish from this guy, whose name was Gormally. He came to the door, and we bought fish from him. And there was also an ice man who came to sell ice. You got your ice delivered every day, and you had the fish man, and the vegetable man. So you really used to have things brought to you. Nowadays, nobody brings anything to you.    Mr. Aumack: Did anyone else come to your door with any type of food or any other product?    Ms. Ellison: Yes, I remember one time there was someone from a tea company. I think it was probably due to the Depression, but somebody came around selling tea, coffee and spices. There was a company, I think it was called Larkin, that might have come around with soap.    Mr. Aumack: But Larkin was separate from the tea company?    Ms. Ellison: No, it was Larkin that had everything. And there might have been others, but I do remember someone coming around from Larkin. People didn't have a job in the Depression, so they would take up selling door-to-door. And I remember the Fuller Brush man, too. It was the Fuller Brush Company that sent representatives around, but it really was hard because people didn't have a job, and they would do anything. And you know, selling door-to-door is hard.    Mr. Aumack: Yes. Did you do anything during the Depression?      Sarah Ellison with her daughter, and Friar Frell at Trinity Church in Matawan, 1942  Ms. Ellison: No, I was going to school. I did babysitting. I think it was towards the end of the Depression that I started working. I went away to art school, and then when I came back home to Matawan, I had a job as a tile decorator. I painted tile. I did that at the end of the Depression, because it was like at the very beginning of World War II. I got married in 1940, and I had been a tile decorator maybe two years, and I worked a year after I was  married. I had retired by 1941 because I got pregnant, and World War II was coming along. Of course that was in the end of 1941. Ree was born in 1941 on December 3rd, and Pearl Harbor happened on December 7th. I was in a hospital bed in Long Branch looking out over the ocean. Once Pearl Harbor came along and the War started, they had vigilantes in Long Branch, because there were submarines out there. People who lived along the shore here knew there were submarines out there. My husband at one time was working in Sandy Hook. Actually he worked for Western Electric, but they were doing a job there. At that time they were discovering radar. It was the very beginning of radar. They were testing the radar on Sandy Hook. And he said the big guns would come up, the sirens would blow, and everybody dived into ground shelters. And the guns fired. Now it is just coming out and stories are talking about the submarines that were out there. I guess some of them are still out there. They were sunk. When the War came along, things changed quite a bit.      Sarah Ellison with her husband and daughter, 1945  Mr. Aumack: Where did you go to art school?    Ms. Ellison: At Newark School of Fine and Industrial art.    Mr. Aumack: What did you want to become?    Ms. Ellison: Well I didn't want to be a teacher at the time. I just wanted to be an artist. I really was interested in commercial art or just painting. I became a teacher when my children were going to school. I filled in for the art teacher, and when they asked me to take on the job, I had to go to college. I spent fourteen years going to night school to get a Bachelor's Degree! I actually graduated from Kean. I attended Monmouth, but Monmouth did not have a degree for me in the Extension Service. You see when I got the job, I had to sign up to get my degree. I signed a paper that said I was working towards my Bachelor's Degree and my teacher's credits. So I just kept going to night school and teaching. And I couldn't stop teaching because they told me if I stopped teaching, I would lose my job. So I didn't stop teaching. And when it came time for me to graduate from Kean, they understood that I could not do student teaching because I was teaching every day. So they sent a professor from the college to watch me teach, and that was my student teaching. I mean I was teaching every day, so I couldn't do the regular student teaching that others were doing. And then I finally got a degree. My Degree is in Fine arts, with a codicil in Education, which is different. They needed an art teacher. You see there were no art teachers around at the time, and I had been substituting for the art teacher in school. And they knew I could do it, because I had gone to art school.    Mr. Aumack: Describe what the War did and your experiences.    Ms. Ellison: My husband didn't go to war because he had a family already, and he worked for Western Electric in the line that made radios for fighter planes. His business was to make radios that went into fighter planes. So he went to work every day, and he did not have to go to War.    Mr. Aumack: Did he ever tell you about his experiences in Sandy Hook? Comment more on that.    Ms. Ellison: Actually no, because at the time it was secret. It was secret work, and he was told not to talk about it. Of course after the War was over, he did tell me that what they did was to perfect radar, which had been invented by Bell Labs. Western Electric was the manufacturing end of the Bell Labs. And Bell Labs had invented this thing called radar, which was used during World War II. His business at the time he worked for Western Electric was with the radar. Now after they finished perfecting radar, he was back up in Newark or wherever Western Electric is. I think it was maybe Kearny. Well anyhow, wherever the plant is. After the War stopped, they didn't need to make radios anymore for fighter planes, so they cut back. He was offered a job in Connecticut, but he wouldn't go. He said he wouldn't leave Matawan. He was a big Matawan supporter. He had been born here, and grew up here. He actually grew up in the house next door. His father owned that house. And then he bought this house from his father. His father bought this house after the War, of course. And then we moved in here when his father got sick and could no longer work. So we moved in with grandmom and grandpop. He bought the house from his father. So now I am still here!    Mr. Aumack: So he was there while they had the scare in Sandy Hook?    Ms. Ellison: Yes, when they were working out there on radar in Sandy Hook. That's where they tested it. And he knew that there were submarines out along the Atlantic Ocean.    Mr. Aumack: Because they saw them on radar?    Ms. Ellison: Well, probably that, and because the defenses along the coast could follow them. But they knew they were there.    Mr. Aumack: After the War, what happened?    Ms. Ellison: Well, then he came back to Matawan and bought a business. His father was a laundry man already, but he wanted to do the same thing as his father. Now this is a door-to-door business!    Mr. Aumack: Laundry?    Ms. Ellison: Yes. They don't do that much anymore, but at that time in the 1940s, not every house had water. I am talking about the countryside. His business was around the farms, and he went around to them. Every summer the farmers would need a lot of help with the wash. Sometimes the wells dried up. And even if they didn't, the farmers got working and sent their wash out. You probably can't remember when people sent their wash out! And that was a business they had, a laundry business. My father-in-law did it for many years, from World War I until World War II, when he got sick. But my husband had his own business, and he eventually had both of them. He took over both lines. But every day he went out all around. He had a business from South Amboy, to Keyport, to Keansburg, and to Red Bank. He visited all around the countryside. He had some customers in town, but in a town like Matawan, you don't need your wash done every week like the farmers did. But that was a big business, to pick up the laundry every week. You picked it up on Monday and delivered it on Thursday. That's one of the businesses that have gone away now, but that was good business then. And besides having a truck to pick up the laundry, we had a store. The store was up where it is now Angelo's Pizza in the Colonial Shops. That store, the end store there, is where we had a store where people could drop off their laundry, too. Then when people got more mobile with cars, and people started going shopping to the malls and out to buy their groceries, they quite often would drop off their clothes. That was mostly men's shirts that had to be washed every week, maybe the tablecloth and sheets had to be ironed, and there would be dry cleaning, too. Now he took his business down to Keyport. The laundry that he was affiliated with was in Keyport, you see. They did the work down there, and all he did was pick it up. Yes, he owned his own business then. This is what happens when you lose a job. You have to think of what you can do, so you start your own business. And he knew about the laundry business, because his father had done it.    Mr. Aumack: Right. Was his father successful?    Ms. Ellison: Yes, he made a living for his family.    Mr. Aumack: Did people need a laundry service because there wasn't any indoor plumbing, or why?    Ms. Ellison: Well that was one of the things, but that would be out in the country on the farms. Now you can't really see the country. I can remember when it was all farms. People lived in Matawan or they lived down on the farm. Matawan had no place to expand. Matawan was all filled up, but it was the Borough of course. But we called everything Matawan. And we called all the towns, Matawan Township. It wasn't until they went to Aberdeen that there was no more Township. Now it's Matawan Borough or Aberdeen. It's all the same to me, though, it's still Matawan Township.    Mr. Aumack: When did he set up the laundry store?    Ms. Ellison: He had the store for five years, and we closed it in 1972. So he started it around 1966 or so. You see, my husband was killed in 1970. He was in his laundry truck, and he was delivering down in Freehold. A couple of girls came through and hit his truck. Actually, it was both of their faults. The girl got out of it because there was no Stop sign, but he was like in the middle of the street. She hit the truck, it spun around, and he flew up, hit the ceiling, and he broke his neck. This was before seatbelts, so he was killed instantly. Ree took over the business because I was a teacher, and I couldn't do it. She ran the business for a couple of years after that. But that is one of the businesses now that are out. Nobody needs a laundry man now because there are washers and dryers in every house. That was another thing. When the developments came in, the developers put washers and dryers in every house. Before that, if you did wash your own clothes, you hung them outdoors to dry. And I think in the developments, they have restrictions that say you can't hang clothes outside. A lot of developments won't allow clotheslines. But every house has its own washer and dryer.    Mr. Aumack: Was it Levitt who built Strathmore?    Ms. Ellison: Well, Levitt was one of them. Segall did Marc Woods, but Levitt had the big development. We called it Strathmore.    Mr. Aumack: Describe your teaching experience.    Ms. Ellison: Well, I always was in Matawan. I was active in the PTA when my children were growing up. I knew the teachers, knew the superintendent, knew the principal, and I knew the art teacher. So I used to go in and help the art teacher, just because I liked it, you see. Then when the art teacher got sick one time, I filled in. So the following year when  Matawan grew, they needed another art teacher. The one art teacher used to do it all for grades one through twelve. The high school art teacher didn't want to teach in the high school anymore. She wanted to teach the little kids. So she went to the grammar school, and I got the high school. So they asked me to fill in. I taught in the high school for five years without a degree. But then the State came in and said they couldn't have teachers without a teacher's certificate. So they let me go. But the principal of the grammar school then said they needed two art teachers in the grammar school, and he hired me for that position. I was let go from the high school in June, and the following September, I was hired to be an art teacher in the grammar school. Then finally Matawan built another grammar school, and that art teacher left to go to the new school. So I ended up here on Broad Street. And I was the Broad Street art teacher.    Mr. Aumack: So you ended up becoming the Broad Street School art teacher.    Ms. Ellison: Yes.    Mr. Aumack: What grade did you teach?    Ms. Ellison: One through sixth.    Mr. Aumack: When you were filling in, what school were you at?    Ms. Ellison: Matawan High School.    Mr. Aumack: And then what grammar school did you teach at?    Ms. Ellison: Matawan Broad Street. You see it was right over here, I was close by.    Mr. Aumack: So how long were you an art teacher at Broad Street?    Ms. Ellison: I was a teacher twenty years. Five years I was in the high school, and fifteen years in the elementary school.    Mr. Aumack: What did you like to teach as an art teacher?    Ms. Ellison: Well, I just liked teaching children. Of course I enjoyed art so much myself. I just found a way to teach it to the kids so they liked it. But art is something that children like. So being an art teacher is really better than being another type of teacher.    Mr. Aumack: At any time, was there any worry that the Art Department was going to be cut from the rest of the curriculum?    Ms. Ellison: No. They always had to have art.    Mr. Aumack: Good. When you were a kid growing up in rural Matawan, what did you do for fun?    Ms. Ellison: Well, Matawan had two lakes, and I liked to swim. So I had friends that lived on both lakes. Sometimes I went in Lake Matawan, and sometimes I went in Lake Lefferts. So we could always go swimming, or we could join some of our friends. I had lots of friends. In my graduating class, there were only thirty-five people.    Mr. Aumack: Was this in high school?    Ms. Ellison: Yes. When I graduated in 1932, there were thirty-five of us, so I knew everybody in town. I had lots of friends, and it was nice growing up in Matawan. Of course I did a lot of walking, because I lived down by the railroad station, and most of my friends were uptown. And in the wintertime, we went ice skating. We used to have ice on the lake for months! I used to be able to walk to school on Lake Matawan. You could walk on the ice all of the way from the dam, where I was, to Church Street.    Mr. Aumack: So you could walk across the entire lake without any worries?    Ms. Ellison: Oh, yes. We had a lot of ice when I was growing up. We went ice skating all winter long. We did lots of sleigh riding and ice skating, and we never had any problems. Of course by the time I got into high school, things were tough. I remember that if you went out on a date, usually I knew two or three people, because there were several girls and several fellows, and maybe somebody in the group would have a car. And we would all chip in. Everybody put in a dollar or two to buy gas. They were really tough times, but we always had a good time. It was the deal that everybody brought the refreshments to a party. Nobody was rich enough to put on the whole party, so everybody brought something. It was like a co-op deal.    Mr. Aumack: And that worked nicely?    Ms. Ellison: Yes.    Mr. Aumack: Now, did you graduate from Matawan Regional High School?    Ms. Ellison: It was Matawan High School. It wasn't called Regional, but just Matawan High School in 1932.    Mr. Aumack: How has Matawan changed, besides what you have already talked about?    Ms. Ellison: Now, because so many people have moved, there are a lot of people I don't know. When I walk downtown, I don't know everybody the way I used to. But then I don't expect to know everybody anymore.    Mr. Aumack: Do you recall the year that you started locking your door?    Ms. Ellison: No.    Mr. Aumack: Really? Ok. How long has this house been standing?    Ms. Ellison: I don't know, I never bothered to research it. My father-in-law bought it, because he knew the people who lived here. And the old man who used to live here must have been in his nineties when he died. And he had been born here. So we know it is over 100 years old! Because we bought it from my father-in-law, and he bought it from his friend, I don't know if anybody ever researched the deed. We know where our boundaries are, but we have to find them because they are sunk in the ground.    Mr. Aumack: Tell us about the name change.    Ms. Ellison: I started teaching in 1959 and then stopped in 1979. So it had to be in the 1970s. I remember being over in Strathmore one time. I had gone over there for a day to teach, to help out with something. Many of the teachers had moved into Strathmore from the city. And they were complaining to me, saying they moved down here because they wanted to live in Matawan, and now they were changing it to Aberdeen. So some of the people weren't happy. Some people wanted to live in Matawan, but I guess the majority wanted to have their own name.    Mr. Aumack: Once it became Matawan Borough, Matawan Township, and Aberdeen, were there any problems? Can you discuss that?    Ms. Ellison: It wasn't any problem, as far as I was concerned, because I was in the Borough. The people in the Township were the ones who thought they had the problems. I didn't have any problems. To me, it's still the Township.    Mr. Aumack: So you lived in the Borough since 1925, and essentially you had nothing to worry about?    Ms. Ellison: Right.    Mr. Aumack: So your zip code never changed.    Ms. Ellison: No. When they changed Matawan Township to Aberdeen, they did not get their own zip code. They still kept the same one.    Mr. Aumack: So you have 07747 for Matawan Borough, Matawan Township, and Aberdeen.    Ms. Ellison: Yes.    Mr. Aumack: Are there any things in Matawan that you wish to happen? Do you want anything changed?    Ms. Ellison: Of course everybody would like to have nice, smooth streets. The holes in the streets are bad, but Matawan is working on them. Yesterday there were surveyors out here. I talked to them and asked if we were going to get a new street, and they said yes. They didn't know when, but the surveyors are at least the beginning. But the potholes are very bad. I would like to see, for the benefit of the people who live downtown, a good grocery store. When Food Town went out, it really was a big minus for Matawan. Again, all the business moved out. And I know they are trying. There is a downtown association that is trying to get people downtown again. But once the Food Town went out, it sort of deserted the downtown area. But that happens everywhere, in all small towns. They all have the same problem. Tonight, you know, is supposed to be Matawan night. I don't know what they are going to do with the stormy weather if it rains. They are having music and things going on down by the Summit Bank. We have to go down there tonight.    Mr. Aumack: What is it celebrating?    Ms. Ellison: Well, I think it started first with the police, where you were supposed to turn on your outdoor lights and go out in the street and celebrate with your neighbors. Well, now they are making the celebration downtown, and they have music down there. I know our church is supposed to be down there with flyers, and I am in the Historical Society. I am supposed to be downtown handing out flyers for the Historical Society. So it is sort of to "blow Matawan's horn," as it were. To talk about the good things you can have in Matawan, I guess that is the idea. Just to let people know what is going on.    Mr. Aumack: What advice would you like to give to future Matawan Township, Matawan Borough, or Aberdeen residents? Or what would you like to say to the future generation who reads this interview?    Ms. Ellison: Enjoy your local benefits, I guess you would call it. Enjoy the countryside. Keep your lakes and streets clean, and make it a nice place to be. Plant flowers, and just make it a nice place to look at and a nice place to be. Keep the old buildings. I enjoy the old buildings. Downtown, everybody likes The Blue House, which is Dr. Ambrosio's house. That is Victorian. I am involved with the Historical Society, and I do the tours at the Mansion, which is the Burrowes Mansion. That house was built in 1723, and it is a beautiful old house. So I enjoy those good-looking old houses. And I would like people to keep them up and not destroy them. We have lost a lot of good-looking houses in Matawan because nobody seems to want them. They are hard to maintain, the plumbing goes after 100 years, and they are hard to keep cool or warm. And in a big old house like this, you can't have central air because the walls are solid. So we have like five air conditioners in this house, on both sides up and down. And people don't seem to want these big old houses anymore. Of course along Main Street, some of them now are businesses. But a lot of them have been lost, because they get torn down. Where the Summit Bank is, there was a nice, old house on that corner. And they tore it down and put in that awful-looking bank. They built a bank that was not in keeping with anything in town, but they did it because it was the cheapest way to put up a building. And that's too bad. We have two, beautiful lakes, if they just keep them up and use them. I still go swimming in them. I go swimming in Lake Matawan all the time. I have a friend who lives over on the Lake, Mrs. Hardy. And she has a dock and a float. I enjoy swimming there.    Mr. Aumack: It's not dirty or anything?    Ms. Ellison: Of course, it is dirty around the edges. The problem with a lake is the leaves have been falling in along the edge. You have to have a dock, or something where you can get away from the edge. Because if you step on the edge of the lake, you step up to your knees in leaves and stuff. But if you have a dock, you can use the lake. But Lake Lefferts has a dock over there, and they sometimes have children's programs there.    Mr. Aumack: The last question had to do with the railroad. Do you remember when it came about and how it changed Matawan?    Ms. Ellison: No, but I do know that when they were putting the railroad in, they did get it into Matawan. The old railroad station there is one of the oldest on the line. Now it has been abandoned, and I am hoping that somebody will come along and really use it or make something with it. They could use it for businesses, restaurants, or something like that. I would like to see that preserved, because right now it is falling apart. The railroad has made a lot of changes because it is a good source of transportation. When they put the electric line in, that was a big step, too. Because so many out-of-towners use it, the traffic is bad here in Matawan at the time of the trains. On Main Street, when the trains come in at night, there is a steady stream, like a parade, going south. Everybody in Marlboro who needs a train comes to Matawan. And that is our biggest problem right now. I think it's the traffic generated by the commuters.    Mr. Aumack: Right, because Marlboro doesn't have a train station.    Ms. Ellison: Right. Everyone south of Matawan comes up here to get the train. The train service is pretty good to the city, whether you are going to Newark, Jersey City, or New York. I do hope that the railroad gets another line south of Matawan. It would be better on our streets. And the commuters are not a benefit for Matawan, because they don't shop here or anything. They just go to the train, get off, and go back home, so all we have is traffic. And that has an effect on everybody in Matawan. That end of Matawan is just one big parking lot now. And they need more parking. I understand that they are talking about putting in a parking garage, because everybody who owns a house down by the station has got cars parked around it.    Mr. Aumack: So it seems that before they are going to make a Marlboro station, they are going to add parking here so more people can come to Matawan.    Ms. Ellison: Yes.    Mr. Aumack: Do you know of any plans to make a Marlboro train station?    Ms. Ellison: No, I don't know of anything. I read in the newspaper that nobody wants a train in their back yard! You know, it's that kind of a deal. I think they are proposing a line that goes north from probably Lakewood or something like that, but I have no knowledge of anything.    Mr. Aumack: Discuss for us the teaching, more in-depth. Was the school system good for you?    Ms. Ellison: Yes. I always felt the Matawan schools were good. With the developments, of course, the school system grew from one or two buildings to maybe seven buildings now. At one time, there was a school in Cliffwood to take care of its Cliffwood children. And then they came over here to high school. Then of course in the 1960s, they built a new high school. At the time they built it, it was the junior and senior high, both. And in about two years it was filled up, because then the developments came in. And then they built a junior high school over on Matawan Avenue. So the school system has gotten rid of the Broad Street school. Where I taught is now the Community Center. And they got rid of Cambridge Park, which were two buildings. We don't have the children like the people did when they first came down.    Mr. Aumack: Do you think that the school systems have made enough space for all the citizens?    Ms. Ellison: Oh yes, I think they built new schools to accommodate them. And now they had to get rid of some buildings because there aren't as many children.    Mr. Aumack: Where do you see Matawan going in the future?    Ms. Ellison: I don't know, I am just trying to hold on. I do think they are going to have to do something about the train station. And they need to try and build up the downtown. That is the main thing now.    Mr. Aumack: Well, thank you very much.    Ms. Ellison: You're welcome.

We ascertained that your birthday is June 14, 1914. Where were you born?    Mr. Venti: I was born in Vineland, New Jersey. That's in South Jersey, deep down in South Jersey.    Ms. Higgins: How did your parents happen to be in Vineland? Where did they come from?    Mr. Venti: Well, I lost my parents when I wasn't even five years old. I have a sister who is eighteen months older in age, and I have a brother who is two years younger than I am, and I must have been about three years old when my mother died, I forget. I don't remember her at all. My father passed away too, and we were more or less orphans. I was with good people. My sister, who lived there many years, was with the nuns in Long Branch with the Star of the Sea Academy. She was there for quite a few years. I would say she was there a good eight or ten years. She went to high school, she had her high school education and everything there, graduated from there, then she went to Philadelphia to live with my cousins, or in Camden. Well, my uncle was from the old school, and he didn't want her to go out, and no movies, no nothing. She met one of our distant cousins, I don't know how close related that was, but she went over to Philadelphia and she lived over there for a while, and she worked in the factory. I forget what she did  a sewing factory, I think it was. And I remember taking her up there in 1934  then she got married. She got married in the year 1937. I was married in the year 1937, too. I am so sorry to say that she is in bad shape right now. My wife and I are having quite a time. We go up there about every other week, trying to keep her wits together. She's all alone, and she doesn't have anyone  her husband died and he had a horrible death. He had cancer, started in his ear, went down to his throat, and it was awful to see them take his jawbones out and he was fed with tubes.    Ms. Higgins: What is your sister's name?    Mr. Venti: Lucy.    Ms. Higgins: What did she do at Star of the Sea?    Mr. Venti: Well, she was raised there with the nuns. She was twenty years old when she left the Star of the Sea to go on her own. They treated her very nicely. I don't know what kind of things she did for the nuns, but they always seemed to give her a few things to do. She accumulated a little bit of money that way.    Ms. Higgins: We're trying to get a feeling of where the people came from that came to Monmouth County. How did your parents come to Vineland?     Mr. Venti: That I don't know, that's where I really came from. But I do know that my mother came from Italy. Their name is on the board at Ellis Island. My brother gets around more than I do  he's married to a woman who wants to be on the go all the time, and they do go all over. And they have good times  they go to Florida for three or four months out of the year, and he has a motor home. But that's not my cup of tea. When I go to Florida, I want to go to a nice hotel, I want to take a shower, and I want to enjoy myself, and we do. But we haven't gone away for two or three years because Doris had the heart operation  since we got married she's had that stent put in her heart. That was the last thing she had done. Before that she had a hip joint done, had no hip. She had a clogged artery problem there. That was a rough operation  it was in a bad spot. They had to put a bypass up here and when you look at the x-ray the tube, or whatever it is, is all stapled. It's just like when they did the hip. They don't sew them up anymore like they used to, they use staples.    Ms. Higgins: Sam, what brought you to Monmouth County and how old were you when you came, and what towns did you live in?    Mr. Venti: Well, I lived with the Lamb family. The Lamb family, the older people. Their daughters and sons had all grown up and we got along just like it was my own father and mother. They were good to us. And then when we got of age, when I got sixteen, seventeen years of age, I went out on my own. When I say on my own, I did some things like picking strawberries in the spring of the year, and I'd make good money picking strawberries in those days. I remember one day I picked to the tune of seven or eight crates of strawberries, and I think you got like a nickel a basket for them at that time, and I guess I made about twelve or fourteen dollars that day. It was a lot of money.     Ms. Higgins: What town did you pick strawberries in? Do you remember the farm?    Mr. Venti: Yes. It was in Millstone.    Ms. Higgins: Well, during the winter where did you work? Strawberry picking is very short season.    Mr. Venti: During the winter I worked for two or three different people. Charlie Erwin was a farmer on Milton Road. The farm's opposite the school there, yes, just about opposite where the Squankum Road School is, and I started working with him in the fall and worked there December, January, February, and part of March.    Ms. Higgins: What did you do, Sam?    Mr. Venti: Well, I was working on the farm, regular farm work. The worst part I had was dragging fertilizer for the coming year. You know they used to have people cutting potatoes for seed. I was carting things from Chamberlin and Barkley in Cranbury. And I used to make two loads a day with a Model T Ford tractor. I tell you, that was hard work. When I loaded up two loads and another load for myself, and you had to work in those days. The young generation doesn't know how easy they have it today.    Ms. Higgins: How old were you when you left school and then you were doing this work?    Mr. Venti: I left school when I was sixteen years old. I was only sixteen. I was glad to go to school because you know everybody, but I just felt I wanted to get ahead.    Ms. Higgins: Where did you go to school?    Mr. Venti: I went to school at Millhurst in Englishtown. Englishtown is a regional school system, just like the Freehold one. It was in March that I left Charlie Erwin because he didn't want to pay me. We had more or less agreed that he was going to give me thirty five dollars a month and my room and board, if you want to call it a room. I could look out and see the stars. I mean, they were poor too. Farmers, they were. But anyway I got a job in the Freehold Rug Mill.    Ms. Higgins: What was the name of it?    Mr. Venti: A & M Karagheusian. I never forgot that.    Ms. Higgins: What did you do there?    Mr. Venti: Well, first you have to practice making all different kinds of knots. Then when the weaver had alteration to do, go from one grade carpet to another grade, there were certain things that you had to do, like put what they call beans, what all the jute and the cotton and then the barbets are involved, that's the frames. So you'd be putting in barbets and keeping the material up so the loom and the weaver, he works the front end and you're working the back end, you're putting in the yarn but he controls the loom, shuts it on and off.    Ms. Higgins: Were these luxury rugs or mass-market rugs?    Mr. Venti: They were both. They were very exclusive rugs, sure lots of times. Then there was the cheaper carpet they made. There was a cheaper carpet and a more expensive carpet that they made. I did that job from 1931 to about 1937 or 1938, I believe it was. Then I had my apprenticeship. It was required that I put seven or eight years in as an apprentice before I could handle a loom. You had to learn, being around all this, you had to learn. You can't just walk in there, and in a week's time say you can operate the loom  you can't. So many things are involved. I had a pretty good career there for a long time. Right after the war we made a little bit more money then we made before. Well, we made a lot more, because I went weaving. Right after the war, I became a weaver to handle the loom. Well, the pay difference was when I started  this is what intrigues you, when I started as a creel boy learning you got twenty-two and a half cents an hour. That's what the start - it came out to, at that time, about eleven dollars and fifty cents a week. And then after so many months I think it went from twenty-two to maybe twenty-five cents an hour. I forget the steps now, you know - it was steps. But after being there about seven or eight years, I got weaving carpet and I made a lot more money. You made pretty decent money. I got married in 1937: my wife, worked in the mill, also. She was what they call a skein winder. That's putting the wool on the bobbins.    Ms. Higgins: Were they Persian rugs?    Mr. Venti: Yes, they were from across the pond somewhere.    Ms. Higgins: That was a very successful factory for many years, wasn't it?    Mr. Venti: Oh, yes. During the Depression, it was a little bit tough, but the Freehold Rug Mill was one of the factories in the state of New Jersey that went along pretty good. The weavers made a pretty decent salary there, and they all had pretty nice homes on some of what you call the better streets, like Brinckerhoff Avenue.     Ms. Higgins: Any on Monument Street?    Mr. Venti: No. There wouldn't be many on Monument Street, but I'll tell you where there were true weavers. You know where the Standard gas station is, after the diner, well you go up that street, and the first aid station is over here - there were four or five weavers there. They did all right.    Ms. Higgins: Where did you and your wife live?      Sam Venti at his home on Parker Street in Freehold, with his Model A Ford, 1942  Mr. Venti: Well, when we got married, we lived in an apartment for only six months on Mechanic Street. It was a practically brand new apartment  it was up over a store I think. It was in nice shape. But we weren't there too long and then we moved over on Institute Street. Then from Institute Street, we moved to Parker Street. As my salary got better, we lived in better places, so to speak. And this house that we have now, which I built myself, I built without a mortgage. No mortgage. I was very fortunate.    Ms. Higgins: You must have been doing pretty well.    Mr. Venti: Well, sometimes I didn't only just work in the rug mills. If things got a little bit slow, sometimes I used to work two days a week. We divided the work  share the work and all that. I had learned enough about the carpet trade. I would go out and take three months off, four months off, and help build a house, and I made not as much as I would make at a mill at that time, but I'm talking about after the slowdown in 1948. During the Eisenhower administration, it was very slow then, too. I don't know why, but it was. They always said Eisenhower was a poor president, as far as the economy went. But I worked almost a year with an outfit in Asbury Park that built homes all over. And at that time they paid me two seventy-five an hour, and then that went up to five something an hour. So I always managed. I didn't sit and cry about anything, I went to work. And the key to the whole thing is get out and get to work and earn your money. But the young generation doesn't want that today.    Ms. Higgins: What kind of an impact did the closing of the rug mill have on your life and the life of people in Freehold?    Mr. Venti: Well, they sold some of their looms to an outfit in New Zealand, and they wanted me to go over there and put those looms up, because I went from weaving carpet to what you call a loom repairman and a loom builder. And that was a good experience. About the last fifteen years of my career of thirty-one years in that mill, I could do work on the side. It's a lot different when you're a weaver  you have to give one hundred percent of your attention when that loom was running, and you better be there if something is happening, because if you don't catch that, it's going to rip out everything, and then it's your fault, because you weren't watching it, you left the loom running. You would be fired. So you see they had rules that governed these things. But I did all right after I went into loom repair. First they had me help to build the looms. The irony of this whole thing was the expansion part of it. I bought my house in 1947 or 1948 when I was a weaver. Some weeks I'd bring home maybe a hundred dollars a week. Well, that's like making a thousand today. My wife, that was my first wife, she was very good too, helping me. We had a very happy life. My life has been good with both women. Doris is very good woman, too.    Ms. Higgins: Was there a union at the rug mill?    Mr. Venti: Yes, I was the president in the last four years at the rug mill. And that's a disaster. I don't want to put that into this interview. It is already in the museum.    Ms. Higgins: Tell me about your house.    Mr. Venti: It is at 65 Parker Street. The only thing I can tell you, it's still a lot of work - you got a house you always have to work. You always got the grass to cut, you always got the trees to trim, and you have -    Ms. Higgins: Gutters.    Mr. Venti: And the gutters - uhhhhhhh. Right at the present time, my son-in-law does help me with that.  I've been cleaning the gutters, but now he does it for me. I reached that age where I can't get around up and down that ladder like I used to. I didn't used to walk up, I used to run up the ladder, but by now I creep along.    Ms. Higgins: What was life in Freehold like in the 1930s and 1940s?    Mr. Venti: It was tough in Freehold the first two or three years I was in the rug mill.  I think it was 1935, it was from the union, and the weavers, you know, it's the one that formed the union, and I never knew nothing about a union. Well John L. Lewis and the CIO were very, very powerful at that time, and boy, they swept across the country. We signed up for the union, and when I say we, I mean everybody signed up. They came around, and you wouldn't dare say, "No, I'm not joining that union," because the weavers were so powerful. They put me on with Jack Smith. Well, Jack, he was my boss. And I'm going to tell you, some of them were nasty to work for. And others were just opposite, so you had the good, the bad, you had to learn to cope with that. I learned pretty well because I knew who was the crab and who was the angels and you'd cope with that. You have to make allowance.    Ms. Higgins: Do you feel, in general, having worked and lived under both systems, that the unions have been a good thing for the United States and New Jersey and Monmouth County, or a bad thing?    Mr. Venti: Well, certainly, I would say yes. But it happened to be that we were aligned with the CIO, and then in 1955 they had what they called a dispute between the two unions, the AFL and the CIO. I'd known both of them, but we had a lot of trouble within the CIO. Whoever got elected president, it always seemed that they were always heading for New York and never wanted to work. I was on the executive board for quite a few years. And I know sometimes it was bad. Depending on who they didn't want to work, they always wanted to cause a little strike, you know, think it was funny. I didn't think it was funny. That's the reason I don't like to get to that end of it. Now I gave a whole complete story to the museum, I don't know if you're familiar with that or not.    Ms. Higgins: Sam, what was the first movie you ever saw, do you remember?    Mr. Venti: The first movie?    Ms. Higgins: Or your favorite movies in the old days.    Mr. Venti: I think the first movie that I ever saw that used to make me laugh like the devil was Laurel and Hardy. Laurel and Hardy. And then I used to watch all those kids like Mickey Rooney, Jack, and all that. I forget all their names, but they were a long time ago. They were the good old days. Now this was before they had talking shows. When I went to the movies, a mailman in Freehold also worked in the Strand theater, and he'd play the organ, you know, boom, boom, the horses trotting, he'd make the noise like the horses trotting and all that. Yes, I remember all that.    Ms. Higgins: Was his name Cullen?    Mr. Venti: Yes, Cullen.    Ms. Higgins: What was the feeling in the community when the talkies came in?    Mr. Venti: Oh, that was great, my goodness! When the talkies came in that was great. And I know the first talkie I saw. It was a movie with Clara Bow. The "It" girl right. I remember she was good  I used to like to see her, and Carole Lombard, and Janet Gaynor  I used to like her pictures, too  I always thought they were good clean shows. Today you get all this junk. My God, I don't watch any of that, I can't stand it.    Ms. Higgins: What were some other fun things that you did? Did you go to dances? What was social life like for you and your family in the 1930s in Freehold?    Mr. Venti: Oh, yes, we went out. In my family, my wife wasn't the type that she wanted to be the toast of the show, or anything, you know. Some girls ask for trouble when they go to these places, you know, they invite trouble, but my wife wasn't that way. She didn't want to dance with this one or that one, she just stayed a couple dances, and her sister was almost the same way, and as I say, we had a happy life, we really had a happy life. But I have no regrets on that part of my life, you know. And when I look back in retrospect I say, well, I'm sad right now, you know why? My brother-in-law passed away, not last night but the day before. He was a very good man, very good man. And he and I were like two brothers, I mean we always did things together, you know, and Grace, who was my sister-in-law, and she was a good woman too. Now she passed away two and a half years ago, and he just passed away, he died of a bad heart. His heart the last year or so was only functioning on about fifteen percent of it. The funeral will be Monday morning - he's at Higgins, and it's sad, you know, it's really sad. But he raised a nice family. He had four children, and they're all college educated and they all have good jobs. Makes a difference, a big difference. In my day, you were lucky you got a job. There weren't any jobs to be had.    Ms. Higgins: Do you remember your first car?    Mr. Venti: Oh, yes. I bought a car for fifty bucks. Fifty bucks and I ran it until I couldn't afford the license, and that was in 1933. Yup, 1933, and we were having trouble in the Rug Mill then, a little trouble, and I put it up with a friend of mine, put it up in a barn, left it there. Then there was a model T Ford. After the mill picked up a little bit, I bought a V8 Ford that was only about a year old and it was three hundred and fifty bucks. You could buy a brand new Ford then for about five hundred dollars, four to five hundred dollars.    Ms. Higgins: Where did you go in your car?    Mr. Venti: Where did I go? I went all over. You mean where'd I drive it?    Ms. Higgins: What did you use it for? You were working as a carpenter at that time?    Mr. Venti: Oh, I'd go anywhere. I used it for going to work, you know, like my carpenter work down there in Shark River Hills. But I would use the car even to go back and forth to the Rug Mill because from Parker Street to the Rug Mill was about a mile.    Ms. Higgins: Were there still a lot of horses as transportation, or the trolley? Tell us about the system of transportation in the 1920s and 1930s in this area.    Mr. Venti: Well, I'll tell you. Before 1930 I can remember the market yard in Freehold. You'd go down there and you might see a big truck over there. People used to come down from New York and Newark. They'd come down here buy the vegetables, fruits, and whatever, and maybe there would be one truck, but the rest be all horses - jagger wagons, and some teams of horses, depending on what they were carting. In those days in Freehold there weren't many cement streets, and there weren't any sidewalks either. They used to have wooden planks on Benton Street, right near the Rug Rill. I remember going to work over there, and I had to walk on those planks to get over to the Rug Mill. It was a big difference, an awful difference. It was hard. A lot of poor souls didn't know how convenient because they passed on too early  should have stayed longer.    Ms. Higgins: What was your reaction to your first television set?    Mr. Venti: Well, I bought mine too soon. I've had a lot of trouble with it. I bought a television set from Wally Goldstein, who sold television sets right across from the Rug Mill. His store was there. And it was a Dumont. My wife was friendly with Mary, can't think of her last name, but anyhow this fellow's name was Bill Oaks  he worked for Willy Goldstein setting up these sets. Every other night, regular by clockwork, he had a Dumont going. And I'll tell you, that was an expensive set. I paid five hundred bucks at that time. At that time it was five hundred bucks, and like a fool I paid Willy Goldstein. I think I paid him cash for it. I went and gave him real cash. Bill, who works for Wally, phoned and told me he had a set, also, and he had a lot of trouble with it, but he didn't want to tell Wally, because he would lose his job. He worked repairing sets. But his wife and my wife were good friends, and he used to come over and he would fix my set and he wouldn't want to take no money, and stuff like that. So it was a good thing we had friends. We had a lot of friends that helped us out too.    Ms. Higgins: What historical events do you feel have had the most impact on your life? You were born at the start of the First World War. Of all these historical events, what do you think have had the most impact on your life?    Mr. Venti: There's so many, it's hard to say. I will have to do a little thinking on that one. Automobiles is one of the things, the other is to see how they used horses to do farming. You'd ride up the road and see the barnyard had fifteen, sixteen horses which they used to farm. You look up the road now, you see no horses, and you see one or two tractors that do all the work sixteen horses done. Another thing: I just came to reality to think about this in the last seven or eight years. If people want to farm they better know something about farming. When I say they better know something, I mean they better get educated, because you cannot farm unless you go to college. For example, everything has to have a certain type of fertilizer. Different plants have to have a different strength. A friend of mine, George Rue, lives up in Upper Freehold Township, and I've asked him two three different times about different things: about how this kind of grass grows, what to get to get rid of what I don't want. I've learnt a lot about that too. If you want a beautiful lawn, you'd better lime it. It's best to lime it in the wintertime, because the snow takes it down, and it doesn't blow away. All these things are what this farmer told me about. It's amazing how many different kinds of ingredients there are for different things, too. Do you remember the DiFidellis?    Ms. Higgins: No. Where were they?    Mr. Venti: I'll tell you where they were, and they're still there.    Ms. Higgins: Where do they farm?    Mr. Venti: I think they have four acres of ground, each with a big house on 537. They were there in 1925, I guess. But I think they're pretty well gone. The younger have ones left, and they have given up farming.    Ms. Higgins: I've interviewed enough old farmers in this area to know that farming is a very hard way to make money, and getting harder all the time for the family farmer.    Mr. Venti: Rue farms all the ground, he farms maybe thousands of acres. But I see he's cutting down this year. But he grows two crops off the same ground, see. In the fall, they plant barley, or they plant rye. That stuff all harvests in early June to July. Then they turn around and plant the soybeans. That's getting two crops. And that's the only way, he says, you can survive. Irrigation is another very important thing for a farmer. If he wants to stay in business he better have some water, or get water and irrigate, or he's taking an awful chance. When I see these things off in the West, like this milk situation, that's pitiful. The middleman makes all the money. The guy that's doing all the hard work, taking care of the cows and all that business, he's hurting, he can't get enough money. I think they get less than a dollar for a whole gallon of milk. A whole gallon, and they get less than a buck. Stores get three. Now they're going up to about three forty.      Sam Venti and Ann Lamb (Smithburg), 1932  Ms. Higgins: Please tell me about the medical practices when you were growing up. When you got hurt or sick, where would you go?    Mr. Venti: Well, when I was a kid, when I lived with the Lamb family, they had us in the hospital, my brother and me, and they took our tonsils out. Today they're not so interested in taking those tonsils out. Doctors used to come to the house, too  if you called them up, they'd come to your house. And my wife and I went to the doctor last Monday. We go in the same room because we get blood work done and all that. The doctor didn't come in for another twenty-five minutes. We never got out of that office until quarter to eleven. And it's that way all the time. They're all doing that. Now we go to Dr. Lario. I don't know if you're acquainted with him or not. He's good, but he's in bad shape right now because he's having a cornea transplant, and it was a waste of time us going down there because he didn't want to do any blood work. He said, "Wait until I come back in September. When I come back, I'll take blood and we'll check you."    Ms. Higgins: Sam, after you worked for the Rug Mill, when did you come to the Monmouth County Library? I understand that you were employed by the Monmouth County Library. Tell us about the early days at the library.    Mr. Venti: I came to the library in 1962 in the spring of the year. I took a test in Trenton. Well, I'll tell you how I got here. I was president of the union the last four or five years. The reason is because I used to fight with the AFL-CIO in New York. When the company made the announcement that they were going to move, they promised that they would handle the situation, do this, do that and do the other, and I called my executive board together. Some wanted to get a lawyer, some didn't, so I called another organization up and told them how everybody felt. So a gal by the name of Pattings, who was a lawyer, came down and said she was going to do so much, but they started moving all the equipment. After the equipment was all moved, I was after them, but all they wanted was the money. And that's what we got out of it. After fighting and arguing so much, we finally settled for anyone who had twenty-five years of service, and they got two weeks' worth vacation severance pay. Now that was chicken feed. But I have a lot of papers home that I gave to that gal down there, a nice gal, at the museum, like what the pay was, and different things like I'm telling you. The pay was eleven dollars and fifty cents a week for krill boys who started working for Karagheusian. Then on the other hand, when you were a weaver you were at the top. Then when Mr. Karagheusian died, everything went to pieces. There was only one other Karagheusian, he was their nephew Charlie, and he wasn't interested in that rug mill at all. He had a yacht down in Brielle. He lived on the yacht- he had housekeepers and everything. But that didn't help us. John Bikler was the head of the state unemployment office in Freehold. When you have a union, the union can appoint anyone to represent a worker and work on any claim that the worker may have against the unemployment office. Well, most of the time, the person himself caused the problem but you can't tell them anything  I've represented many different ones. Every time I was honest when I represented them. This gal Mary, whose last name I forget, had a problem. I said, "Now wait a minute. You tell me they objecting to paying you for the last two weeks?" But this was the reason: she was told to come in for her checks every two weeks, but Mary told the woman at the window, "Oh, I got to go to Florida for two weeks because I'm not working." The woman says, "Oh, that's nice." Two weeks when Mary came back to sign up to get another check, the woman said to her, "Oh no, we can't pay you." Mary says, "What do you mean?" and she comes busting to me. She didn't tell me all the story, so I go up there and I learn, and I say, "Mary, you're not honest with her yourself. Are you that dumb?" If she had not said anything, she would have gotten her money. And that happens all the time, all the time that happens. That's only just one of the things that happened. They used to curse me. Some women can be tough with language. You wonder where they pick it up. I'd been sworn at a lot.    Ms. Higgins: When did you come and work for the county? Did you have to take a civil service exam?    Mr. Venti: Yes, civil service. So I just about made it. Seventy-one or two I scored. So I went to work, I think it was as a bookmobile driver. Remember Don Price? He was the bookmobile driver. He died almost a year ago. Anyway, poor Don was a nice guy, but he was so careful. I don't know how they got along with him like they did, but he had a lot of different women that rode on that bus with him. He was a good driver, but he was always sick. I don't know what was the matter with him. Got a mental problem. And I got involved in that too. His father and mother were dead and gone, and my wife got involved. I'd call her and say, "Look, take Don down to the hospital." He was dealing with some psychiatrist, and whenever he got real bad, he went to the hospital. Did you ever meet Julia Killian who was the director then? Anyway, she was my boss. She was all right. The library was not in very good shape. She didn't want to leave the library. She brought people in the library. Anna Wang knows this too  she brought people in the library because she thought they were friends, so she gave them a job and stuff. This was a woman I'm talking about. Next thing you know Julia is out. And during the War she was with the Red Cross, she was some kind of official at the Red Cross, and she was a brave woman. I'm a firm believer, don't kick anybody when they're down, if you can't help them, get out of the way. She was very critical of Jack Livingstone, her successor. Jack was a good man. He was fair with me. He made this library what it is today.        Monmouth County Library Bookmobile    Ms. Higgins: Tell us about a day in the life of a bookmobile driver.    Mr. Venti: Sometimes they'd go to spots that weren't doing anything. You probably heard that too. I don't like to get involved with it, but I used to say about the different ones, "Why are they going up on Norfolk Farm? There's only one woman who comes up there. You don't need a big bookmobile dragging all those books up." But I never said anything one way or the other. Livingstone was smart, he knew what he was doing. Jack, he gets credit for what the library is today. He was fair with me. He and I got along good because he wasn't afraid to work either. The first day he came to where I was working, the library had that place over on Marcy Street. They were getting ready to move, and we had thousands of boxes of books. We had to sort them. I drove a small bookmobile, I liked that, and it was a good job. I used to drive the school bookmobile to the schools. They used to change all their books, and I got along good with everybody. Everything went fine. If something happened to the bookmobile, I'd fix it myself. I worked on motors and stuff. So Jack called one day and I had the carburetor off the bookmobile at the school, and he came up and he says, "So what's the matter?" So I said, "I'll tell you what's the matter, Jack, I went down to the gas pump, and we found out there's water in the gas and this thing won't start. So I drained the tank. I saw a tactic to get the carburetor off to get the water out of the carburetor." He said, "Well, I'll be." He couldn't get over me. He says, "I'm going to put you head of this equipment around here." And he did.       Sam Venti with his granddaughter, Mary Aurora Kress, June 1969  Ms. Higgins: Sam, I'd like to ask you to talk now to future generations. We are hopeful that future generations will be listening to and reading this interview. What wisdom would you like to pass on to them? What disturbs you most about the world today? What are the good things that you think we should capitalize on?    Mr. Venti: First thing that I would say to the younger generation, and I know they won't like this - don't start smoking in the first place. That's number one. Number two, get away from this business of running to the saloons. And the rest will take care of itself. And always be truthful - if you do something wrong, don't be afraid to admit that you did it, because you're a bigger person when you admit it, and you're a smaller one when they catch you in a big lie. These are my words to this generation today. And work never killed anybody. Work always helped. And it even helps me in this day and age, and if I just sat in a chair like a couple of my friends have done, I would be in bad shape. Twelve years ago, this guy I know decided he wanted to stay home. He watches all the shows and movies all day long into the night. His wife is going crazy. She was working, but she was sick of working so she quit, but she exercises. But Joey's in the institution in a wheelchair. She had to put him in there because she couldn't take care of him.    Ms. Higgins: Well, you are certainly in very good shape.    Mr. Venti: When you feel pains just kick your leg around a little bit. You got to keep it going.    Ms. Higgins: I wish you a very happy belated birthday and many happy returns. And we appreciate this interview very much.    Mr. Venti: That is what my advice to the young kids is. It is the advice that I will preach at.    Ms. Higgins: Good for you, Sam, thank you again.
MonmouthCounty;Rose Staples;xxxx;2000;Rose Staples, xxxx, 2000              Remembering The 20th Century: An Oral History of Monmouth County      Rose Staples, 1993  Date of Interview: July 12, 2000  Name of Interviewer: Flora Higgins  Premises of Interview: Monmouth County Library Headquarters, Manalapan, NJ  Birthdate of subject: N/A    Ms. Higgins: Well, Rose, welcome to the project. We are very happy you agreed to share your memories with us this afternoon. Can you tell us a little bit about when you came to Howell Township?    Ms. Staples: I was a year-and-a-half, so I can't remember what is was like then, but, I have memories as far back as when I was four years old. When we moved to Howell, we moved to a section of Howell called Freewood Acres. And I do believe it was a planned community at that time, and  whether other plans came to fruition or not, I don't know. But I can remember it as being very small. The area next door to our house, was like a summer camp. It was where a mother and her children could come down for the summer from the city, and the father would come down the weekends to visit. There were a few of these type of camps in the area of Howell Township  I can remember a few not in Freewood Acres. That was the only one in Freewood Acres. But I do remember a lot of these types of camps in the surrounding area. There were people who owned private homes and the wife and children would come down for the summer,  and the father would come down and visit. In the area Freewood Acres on Route 9, there was  a small pond with a beach area.    Ms. Higgins: I was going to ask what they did all day.    Ms. Staples: And on that little pond was a pavilion. I can't recall too much about the pavilion, but I was told that there were activities there at night and so forth. I can't say it was a  rural area, but it wasn't a farm area. But it  had dirt roads, gravel roads, no sidewalks. There were many general stores in the area with no supermarkets or anything like that where you could walk to. To get to a supermarket you had to actually go into the town of Freehold, which was eight miles away. And there they had a small Acme, I do believe.  .  Ms. Higgins: Did most of them have cars?    Ms. Staples: No. Very few mothers had cars. You had to wait until your spouse came home and had a day off on the weekend, that's when you went grocery shopping or went to market or you went to do different things. But most women at that time did not have a car. In order to go to school, I had to walk about a quarter of a mile on a shortcut through the woods to get to the bus stop -- where there was no shelter -- and stand there and wait - a real hardship.  I went to the Howell School, which is the Ardena School right now. I believe that was built in 1939, and I started there in 1945.    Ms. Higgins: So it was pretty new then.    Ms. Staples: It was a new school and actually was a model school. It drew many people to come to look at it because it was a model school. It was a beautiful school. I remember starting kindergarten. It was in a large, large room which actually had a fireplace in it. Can you imagine that?    Ms. Higgins: Did they ever use it?    Ms. Staples: No. They never used the fireplace. But it gave a homey feeling. It was a self-contained kindergarten that had its own bathroom facilities and lunch was served in there.     Ms. Higgins: Why else was it a model school?    Ms. Staples: Because of the architecture. It was very pretty at that time.  Previous to that school there were one-room schoolhouses, and that was the first township school that wasn't a one-room schoolhouses. And everybody went to that one central school. It was kindergarten through the eighth grade.    Ms. Higgins: I get the impression you were happy there.    Ms. Staples: Yes. For the most part it was different. In my neighborhood there weren't a lot of children to play with, so when you went to school, that was your whole social life. And I also recall that  if you got sick in school,  the nurse would call up your mother, and we were the only people on our street that had a phone. I'll get into that later. The nurse would call my mother, and of course my mother would say, "Well, I can't come pick her up. I have no car. And my husband is at work." Either the nurse would keep you in the office until she thought you felt better, or if she thought you were seriously ill, she would actually take you home. More about the telephone. I remember we were the only people on our street who had a phone, and we had about four or five close neighbors. And people would think nothing of calling our house and saying, "I have a phone call for so and so, he lives down the street from you. Can you go get him?" And we would think nothing of going out of the house, getting these people, and bringing them back to our house so they could talk on the phone.    Ms. Higgins: Can you imagine, now everybody has three phones.    Ms. Staples: And at that time, it was party lines. I think there was something like sixteen people on a party line. So, if you picked up the phone you heard somebody speaking, you just hung it up. You didn't stand there and listen. I'm sure some people did. But, you know, you put it down and waited until the phone line was clear. And that was the normal procedure, I mean, you just didn't think anything of it.    Ms. Higgins: You mentioned your father's work. What did your father do?    Ms. Staples: My father worked for Freehold Lumber, which was a supplier of all the lumber in this part of the county, I believe. That's why we moved to Howell, because before that we lived in Hightstown, and he wanted to be closer to the relatives who lived in Toms River. So he took this job.    Ms. Higgins: He must have been pretty busy. They were doing so much building in the post-war years.    Ms. Staples: I imagine so, although I can't recall how busy he was. I do know he did work six days a week. But it was normal thing to work six days a week and  to get one week's vacation a year. And for that week's vacation we always went to Atlantic City for about two or three days. And it was so quaint because you could ride all the way on Route 9 to Atlantic City without one traffic light.    Ms. Higgins: Oh, what a memory. You are a young woman and yet here you have seen this tremendous revolution in Atlantic City and telephones, among other things.    Ms. Staples:  Lakewood, which is in Ocean County, was a very picturesque place.  There were flowers and different things, and although Route 9 was a very busy highway, it wasn't overwhelming. So the other two children who lived in our neighborhood and I would walk to Route 9 and sit on the curb and and watch  the traffic. In the summertime it would be heavy stop and go traffic. There were no crossways, or four lane highways. It was just a two-lane highway at that time, so it would be stop and go, and drivers would talk to us because we were sitting there.    Ms. Higgins: Can you tell us anything about the Russian Church in Howell?    Ms. Staples: I can't tell you too much about the Russian Church, but I do recall  the Russians were called DPs for Displaced Persons, when they immigrated. And when they came over, it seemed like it was all at once. My father had a lot to do with them because my father spoke Russian and he translated for them a lot. And it seems so strange because, when these people came, and now even today, your front yard  is lawn, and your back yard was where you put your flowers or whatever or you planted your garden. But these people came from a different economic society, and so every bit of land they had was devoted to their gardens. They didn't believe in a lawn. A lawn was a waste of property. They either planted their flowers or they used it for their vegetables.    Ms. Higgins: And they settled around Freewood Acres.    Ms. Staples: That's right, yes.    Ms. Higgins: How did your people get to Monmouth County? What part of the world did they come from?    Ms. Staples: My father and mother both came from what was then called White Russia and I believe it is part of Poland now. My father came, I believe, in 1905 and my mother came in 1913 or something like that.  They both settled in  New York, and then my father's family bought a farm in Toms River. They were introduced by different relatives. And they were married in 1921.    Ms. Higgins:Was Rova Restaurant  there when you were growing up?    Ms. Staples: I believe it was there, although I wasn't familiar with it. It was like a distant thing. Probably in the war years things were rationed. You didn't have that much gas. You didn't ride all over. You only went where you had to go to. You only went to the store. Maybe once a week you would go see relatives, but it wasn't a thing that we went just riding, generally riding to different places.    Ms. Higgins: What public transportation  was available?    Ms. Staples: Yes, because we only a lived a block from Route 9.  Twelve year olds could get on a bus and ride to Lakewood or Freehold by themselves just to go to the movies.  My mother gave me a dollar. I got on the bus, paid the bus fare, got to Lakewood or Freehold, paid to get into the movies, came out, got a malt, and got a bus back home, and I still had change left over.    Ms. Higgins: Where did you get your malt?    Ms. Staples: Next door to the movie house in Lakewood there was a drug store. And at that time almost all drug stores had soda fountains.    Ms. Higgins: The root beer floats?    Ms. Staples: I really didn't know anything about root beer, but I would get either an ice cream soda or malted milkshake or something like that.    Ms. Higgins: In the silver things.    Ms. Staples: In the silver things, right.    Ms. Higgins: Where was the movie house in Freehold?    Ms. Staples: Back as far as I can remember, there were two, but both burned down. There was the Palace and there was the Strand. They burned down at different times.    Ms. Higgins: What were some of your favorite movies?    Ms. Staples: Anything with Esther Williams in it. I thought she was wonderful.     Ms. Higgins: Did you see cartoons with it?    Ms. Staples: We saw a cartoon, possibly a short of the news, I forget what they called that. There is a name for that, maybe the Movietone news. We saw that. And maybe a double feature, but I don't remember too many doubles.     Ms. Higgins: One dollar would get you the bus ride, the movie and the malted.    Ms. Staples: Yes.    Ms. Higgins: It was a different world.    Ms. Staples: I felt very safe, didn't feel threatened at all. It was very pleasant. There were a lot of wooded areas around our little neighborhood, and with a couple of other children who lived in my neighborhood, I would go into the woods. We would build forts and pick berries. There were numerous wild blackberries, blueberries, and strawberries that we would pick. It was a very pleasant area. Very pleasant.    Ms. Higgins: What kind of games would you and your friends play?    Ms. Staples: Monopoly. We liked to play cards. Like I say, we would build our forts and make believe we had a house. And we had to use our imagination.  Believe it or not, four children could play baseball. We didn't even need nine. Four of us could play together and have a baseball game.    Ms. Higgins:Tell us about your high school years.    Rose Staples, 1958    Ms. Staples: High school opened a new world for me. One half of the township went to Lakewood High School. The other half of the township went to Freehold High School. So, some of your friends that you made in grammar school were split up. I  went to Lakewood High School for one year, but it was my freshman year. Then the Freehold Regional was organized. Then all of Howell went to Freehold Regional High School system.    Ms. Higgins: Which one?    Ms. Staples: The one in the Freehold Borough.    Ms. Higgins: That's the one that is supposed to be so good, right?    Ms. Staples: Yes. And that was the first regional high school. Then the area grew and became split up again. So we were back to what we had before. We were in grammar school, then we all went to different high schools. And then regional came along and brought us together again. And then the regional high school broke up, so we have Colts Neck and we have Marlboro and we have Howell. So what comes around goes around.    Ms. Higgins: Did you like being able to go to the high school with your friends from the grammar school?    Ms. Staples: Oh, yes.    Ms. Higgins: Please tell us a little bit about Howell High School.    Ms. Staples: I can't really because my children never attended there, and I never did. Howell High School never came into being until after I left. I can remember it is very close to Farmingdale. Farmingdale was another little community that was popular with my family. That's where our doctor was. That's where our drug store was. It was a quick ride to get there. There was no traffic. It was a pleasant ride because it was very, very rural. There were a lot of wooded areas.    Ms. Higgins: Farmingdale is still pretty rural, isn't it?    Ms. Staples: Yes, it's more rural than other places that have changed. It was also the place where we had our synagogue. It was actually in West Farms, which is in Howell.    Ms. Higgins: You said you went to the Ardena School. Is that the name of a section in Howell?    Ms. Staples: Yes, Ardena is a section of Howell. You have sections: Freewood Acres, West Farms, Fort Plains, Jerseyville, Adelphia. All that was Howell. It is still the same, although it is not identified as such. There is also Ram Town. I am sure I am missing some places, some sections, but that is how it was divided.    Ms. Higgins: Was it all one governing body?    Ms. Staples: Yes, yes.    Ms. Higgins: Mayor and Council?    Ms. Staples: This particular type of township was all one.    Ms. Higgins: Do you remember your parents talking about how Howell Township was run?    Ms. Staples: Oh, yes. My father was a little active in politics, not greatly so. He had an interest in it, let me put it that way. He had a civic interest in Freewood Acres. Actually Freewood Acres as a planned community at one time had a civic organization, which was dissolved, I believe, around 1948 or 1949, something like that. Freewood Acres had three general stores, which if you think about it really was amazing, because Freewood Acres was small. But in the wintertime these general stores were very slow. When the summer people came down, and there were a lot of summer people that came down,  these little stores were very busy. They sold ice cream and canned goods. And one or two had a soda fountain. And it was close. You knew everybody, winter and summer. When you got stuck in the wintertime, you could call on your neighbor to help come dig you out. Or you could hitch a ride somewhere. It was a very close community.    Ms. Higgins: Is Monmouth County like that now?    Ms. Staples: Certain sections. I'm sure you have closeness in some neighborhoods no matter where you are.    Ms. Higgins: Do you remember particularly any restaurants that your family used to go on a celebration?    Ms. Staples: There was one in Lakewood that was an Italian restaurant. I can't remember the name of it. My father loved Italian food.  And once in a while we would go there. I think the whole meal cost about a dollar.    Ms. Higgins: Was the Cabin around when you were growing up?    Ms. Staples: It might have been, but I don't think it was called the Cabin. Previous to that it was a bar. It was called Art's Bar. And a man by the name of Art Andretta owned this particular place. Coincidently, the owner and my husband's family were neighbors at one time. They had known each other almost all their lives.  Another bar, actually in Freewood Acres, was interesting: it was called Deer Head Inn. And out in front there was a little structure like a cage. And in that cage, there was a monkey, believe it or not.    Ms. Higgins: A real monkey?    Ms. Staples: Yes  it was an attraction. This was a vacation area -- not a vacation like you think today. But it was a vacation area, so you had to have attractions. Further down on Route 9, right on the Lakewood border, there was a an attraction called Deer Park, where they had animals. It was almost like a zoo. I have a couple of pictures from there.   Some of the deer were confined and some of them were actually walking around, and you could go up and touch them and pet them. They had other animals too, but it was mostly deer. And then on Route 33, there was another attraction. I guess it started in the 1950s. It was called Cowboy City. They used to put on shows where you felt like you were in a western atmosphere, and different things like that. You could go visit there and spend the day there. Also we would go to Asbury Park at least twice a year in the summer time for the rides, and for the candy, and things like that. Asbury Park was a big attraction for us.  That was our thing - Asbury Park.    Ms. Higgins: Do you remember a place called Storyland?    Ms. Staples: It sounds familiar but I don't know. I possibly could have gone there, but I don't remember.    Ms. Higgins: It was of the same era as Cowboy City.    Ms. Staples: Cowboy City, yes. But I don't recall really going there. But it's, it's familiar. It rings a bell.    Ms. Higgins: When you left high school, what did you do?    Ms. Staples: When I left high school,  I really didn't know what to do with myself, what direction I should take.  I had a girlfriend who was going to beauty school. She said, "Why don't you come with me?" She had started, I think two months before me. It was in Newark.  I went up and I looked and I liked it, and I thought I'd do it. I was a little creative and I thought I would enjoy it.  My father didn't think I should drive to Newark. The easiest way to get there was to drive to Matawan and get on the train to Newark.  I liked beauty school very much. It was my career for the next thirty years.    Ms. Higgins: Where did you practice?    Ms. Staples: My first job was in Lakewood and I worked there for about two years until I had my first child. And I dabbled in another place for another year or so until I had my second child. Then we moved to our house in Howell on Vanderveer Road, which is actually between the Jerseyville section and the Ardena section of Howell. We built a house there, and my husband put a beauty parlor in for me to work while my children were growing up. I operated that for about eight years until we sold that house and then I worked at another beauty parlor for another ten or twelve years after that.    Ms. Higgins: How did you meet your husband?    Ms. Staples: There was a club, a place called Howell Lanes in Freehold, where I was on the bowling team. He happened to walk in and he was speaking to someone that I knew. And then we started speaking. And from there it developed.    Ms. Higgins: I remember Howell Lanes. It's still there.    Ms. Staples: Howell Lanes is still there. Yes.    Ms. Higgins: What did your husband do?    Ms. Staples: My husband at that time was a carpenter and was working for his uncle. We  got married about a year and a half after we met. When we first married, we moved to the Borough of Freehold.    Ms. Higgins: You lived in the Borough?    Ms. Staples: On Bennett Street in Freehold in a little upstairs apartment. And we lived there for two years. And then we bought land in Howell on Vanderveer Road and built a house there.    Ms. Higgins: What was Freehold like then?    Ms. Staples: Actually, when I was in high school I worked in the drug store in Freehold called Fagan's Drug Store. It is on the corner of Main Street and Throckmorton Street. It was a small drug store  it didn't have a soda fountain. Maybe that is why they hired me. And I was a clerk there after school for about two years. We were very familiar with everyone in the town. This was such a small town. For instance, if someone came in with a prescription to be filled, and we didn't have that particular product in our store, I would be sent down the street to another drug store to get it and bring it back so our  pharmacist could fill that prescription.    Ms. Higgins: Very friendly.    Ms. Staples: Yes, it was a very friendly place. It was very nice. After work I took a bus home because I didn't have my own car. Well, I was only sixteen, so I couldn't drive anyway. The bus would drop me off at the corner and I would walk home.    Ms. Higgins: Was Freehold having bad times then as compared to good times now, or about the same, or what?    Ms. Staples: I wouldn't say it was bad times, but it was different times. Freehold had little shops all up and down Main Street, and up and down Throckmorton Street. They were very busy because we didn't have the malls. The first mall, in our area  was, I believe, Monmouth Mall in Eatontown, which started in 1959. So we used to have all these little shops and it was pleasant. You didn't have a large range, but there was a personalized atmosphere. When you went in, someone waited on you. They brought your clothes to the dressing room. It was a different type of shopping, definitely.    Ms. Higgins: Was Al's Bootery there then?    Ms. Staples: Al's Bootery was there as far back as I can remember. The drug stores: let's see, there was Dubois' Drug Store, there was another one on the corner of Main Street and South Street. And I'm sure there were two more, although I can't remember the names.  All the banks were in town. There were no driveups. Nothing like that. They were all in the center of town. The post office was in the center of town.  Federici's was there at that time, and I can remember that restaurant. There was another restaurant called George's, which was on the opposite side of the street. There was also a bakery there, and I can't remember the name of it, but it was an excellent bakery, excellent. There was also a little place called the Tilton's Sweet Shop. How this place survived, I don't know, because it was a high school hangout. After school everybody walked right straight there, sat down and had a coke. And you sat there for three hours with one coke. Nothing else.    Ms. Higgins: Was it maybe fifteen cents?    Ms. Staples: Maybe, yes, something like that. It was very interesting. We went to Tilton's Sweet Shop to sit and have a coke and hangout. Now teenagers go to the malls  to hang out. That was our hangout.    Ms. Higgins: Did they have a jukebox?    Ms. Staples: No, I don't believe they had a jukebox. It is possible they did, but I don't recall it too much. I really don't.  I didn't go there that much because what you had were people who came in from the outlying areas and then you had the townies. And the townies were the people who went to the Sweet Shop.    Ms. Higgins: Every small town seems to have cliques.    Ms. Staples: Yes, caste system, social order.    Ms. Higgins: Did you use the Freehold Public Library?    Ms. Staples: No, no, I never did.    Ms. Higgins: Is that because you were a teenager or because no one did, or don't you know?    Ms. Staples: Possibly some did. As a teenager, the only library I ever used was the school library. I was unaware of the County Library. It was not a thing that you were introduced to. It may have been there but I was unaware of it.    Ms. Higgins: What were your favorite areas of study, and do you remember any teachers who helped you?    Ms. Staples: My favorite subject was history, but I was a very poor student. I have to say this now. I was not a studious student. One of my favorite teachers was a Mr. Van Etten, who actually went to Freehold Regional too when I was in Lakewood High School as a freshman when Freehold Regional started. He changed, so it was like...gee....he's coming too. He was the history teacher and that was my favorite subject. Not because of him, but I did like history a lot. That was my favorite. When it came to math or anything like that, forget it. And I won't even speak of English Literature. I don't even want to think about it.    Ms. Higgins: What about your children? Where did they go to school and were you happy with the education they received?    Ms. Staples: I was satisfied with the education they received. When my children were in high school, we had moved to Freehold Township. We had sold our house in Howell Township and we moved to Freehold Township. And both my children went to Freehold Borough High School.    Ms. Higgins: Same one you did?    Ms. Staples: Yes. And my husband also went to Freehold Borough High School.    Ms. Higgins: So were your children prepared for college from that?    Ms. Staples: No. They didn't choose to go to college, which is a shame. But they are both very successful. So, it's a moot point.    Ms. Higgins: What do they do? And where?    Ms. Staples: Both of my children are brick masons.    Ms. Higgins: I see a trend of home building here with your father in the lumber business, and your husband being in carpentry, and your children brick masons.    Ms. Staples: Yes. And it is still hard for me to turn off one of these home improvement shows. I like it. I enjoy it.    Ms. Higgins: What were some of the musical pieces that you recall from your teenage years?    Ms. Staples: Rock'n'roll came into being when I was in high school.    Ms. Higgins: Elvis?    Ms. Staples: Not Elvis. Elvis was not the first. Bill Haley and the Comets were the first.  I think Elvis Presley came around 1956 and, of course, I liked him. I was like every other teenage girl. I liked him very much and I remember my girlfriend and I getting on the bus and going to Lakewood to the movies to see his first picture, Love Me Tender.    Ms. Higgins: How about the Beatles?    Ms. Staples: The Beatles, well, by then I was a married lady, and I wasn't interested. I thought they were, oh my goodness! That long hair! You know. How inappropriate and all that stuff. But, I really didn't appreciate them at that time. But in my later years I did appreciate them very much, yes.    Ms. Higgins: Rose, could you describe for me some of the fads in the field of beauty that came and went when you were a beautician?    Ms. Staples: Yes. Now that's a story in itself because you have to understand that  I went to hairdressing school in Newark. We were trained to do haircuts on females only, mind you, because that's how you got your license. Cut hair, give permanents, nails, and facials. And you did all of this under that category of women.  It is strange today, because now it's unisex, whereas then it was separate. Either you had a barber's license or you had a hairdresser's license. Either one or the other. You didn't have both. Women were not allowed to do men's hair unless you had a barber's license and vice versa.    Ms. Higgins: When did this change, and how did you feel about it?    Ms. Staples: I feel good about it. Everything used to be segregated, even as far as race. African-Americans had their own hair salons, also. You just didn't do it. You weren't trained to do it. It was entirely separate. But then, when everything changed, I think it was a big improvement.    Ms. Higgins: I understand from previous interviews that there was a lot of racial discrimination in Freehold and Howell.    Ms. Staples: In Howell I can't say there was. But maybe that was because of my father. My father was a very tolerant man. I have a better word for it. It's not tolerant, it's more than that. My father was civic minded and very broad-minded.  When I was young, I recall, when African Americans came in your house, other people looked at you very strangely. But my father thought nothing of it. Or of going to their houses. Or going to their churches for their church dinners. He didn't think anything of that. My father was a broadminded individual, and I got that from him. But I knew there was tension. I didn't think of it as a racial tension. I knew we were different.  It was different, as far as racial hatred, I wasn't aware of that, actual hatred. That wasn't something I was familiar with.    Ms. Higgins: Where did your mother's people come from? You said Russia originally, but then she came to New York and met her husband. And she was a homemaker?    Ms. Staples: Yes.    Ms. Higgins: She didn't have a career?    Ms. Staples: No, no.    Ms. Higgins: Did you have siblings?    Ms. Staples: Actually I had one sister and she was quite a bit older than me. So, it wasn't a close relationship. When I was six years old, she left home to go to California,  which was a very big undertaking in 1946. So even though I had a sibling, I was raised as an only child. And so was she.     Ms. Higgins: Who were some of the people you idolized or who were heroes to you? Who were your twentieth century heroes?    Ms. Staples: Well, I idolized Roosevelt.  I can remember Truman. My father absolutely adored Truman. My mother adored Roosevelt.  I can still remember the day John Kennedy was shot. I can remember plainly. I knew exactly where I was and what I was doing. I had the television on because it was this soap opera I watched every day. Then this interruption came on. And there's Walter Kronkite announcing this terrible thing. And you knew exactly where you were. I can understand people knowing exactly where they were when Roosevelt died and the announcement came.  We lived in a rural area  if you had to go to the hospital, you didn't think so quickly to call an ambulance, although there were ambulances. There was a first aid, exactly where in Howell Township, I don't know, but there was a first aid. And if you needed an ambulance, you could call one. But most of the time if you were sick they took you to the hospital. And the only hospital in the area was either in Lakewood, which was Kimball, where I was born, or Fitkin Hospital, which is now Jersey Shore Medical Center. So we had a ways to go to a hospital, or even a doctor. Nothing was around the corner. You had to think of this when someone got sick. And, of course at that time, if you were ill and called a doctor.    Ms. Higgins: You did not have television as a child.  Do you remember the impact that television had when you got your first set?    Ms. Staples: I was enthralled. I was amazed. We had the first telephone on our street, but our neighbor had the first TV. And, naturally, anything they had was mine. And I can remember Kukla, Fran, and Ollie. I think the TV was  only broadcast two or three hours a day. It started at 6:00 pm until maybe 9:00 o'clock at night. I was absolutely thrilled by it.  I remember watching Kukla, Fran, and Ollie and, of course, I remember Howdy Doody. That was about 1947 or 1948. Then my father got our own television set. He would savor things, and we naturally had to watch his favorite things, which were Milton Berle and wrestling.    Ms. Higgins: Wrestling. Was that on then?    Ms. Staples: Wrestling was on. Antonio Rocco was his favorite wrestler and, of course,  boxing came in further down the line, which was another thing he enjoyed immensely.     Ms. Higgins: How many channels did you have access to?    Ms. Staples: We had access to thirteen very snowy channels. Very snowy. Actually it was only twelve channels, because Channel 1 was not a channel that was there for anybody. We could only get New York stations: CBS was Channel 2, NBC was Channel 4, Channel 5 was Dumont, Channel 7 was ABC, and then there was Channel 13, which nobody knew about. I remember more about Freewood Acres. Near the pavilion, actually on the same piece of property, was this little pond, which was like a little swimming area. There was a World War II honor roll put up. I can remember a party there and everybody being happy at the end of the war.  I remember people in uniform being there. Lakehurst was not too far from Lakewood, and whenever we went to Lakewood. Now when my father drove to Lakewood, he would encounter at least one serviceman hitch hiking, at least one, maybe two or three. And he would make three stops to pick these people up because that was the thing to do. You never passed a hitchhiking serviceman on the highway without stopping to pick him up. I can remember being in the car with two or three in the back seat of the car when we went somewhere.    Ms. Higgins: Rose, you now are working for the Monmouth County Library. How long have you worked for the library? And how did you happen to become employed here?     Ms. Staples: I have been working for the library for eleven years. Actually I got the job on a brainstorm. I had been working somewhere else, where I was happy, but I wanted full time work. I had stopped doing hairdressing. I just wanted to change my career, which put my husband  in shock. I said, "No, I really want a change." So I worked in a couple of other places. I was happy, but I wanted my own benefits. I wanted hospitalization. I wanted a pension. I wanted things like that. That meant a full time job. I was in Freehold on day, and I said to myself, " I think I'll go over to Personnel in the Hall of Records and and see what's available." The lady, Mrs. Brown, said to me, "Would you like to work at the library?" And I said, "Yes! Sounds great to me." And that's how I started.  Actually prior to coming to the library, I read more than I do now only because of my eyes. My eyes get too tired and I can't read as much as I used to. But it seems a shame that I was more of a reader before I came here than I am now. The audio books are nice, but I like to see the written word. I'm more comfortable with that, although audio books are very interesting. I'm sure for people  whose eyesight is really bad,  and for people who travel, audio books are perfect.    Ms. Higgins: Rose, you've seen a lot of changes in Monmouth County. Can you comment on these changes?    Ms. Staples: Yes, I think I'm like every other person. I think, "Oh, back then it was so nice, it was so wonderful." Yes, it was nice, and it was wonderful, and it was a quieter time, and it was, I believe, a safer time. We felt safer anyway. And it was an easier time. We didn't have pressures. We didn't have two cars to every family. We didn't have a telephone in every room. We weren't under pressure to dress a certain way. I never felt peer pressure from other children or my classmates. You didn't have to do certain things. Towards high school, I think you do feel more peer pressure. I have to say then you did do things, but they weren't unreasonable things. But then you think back and remember it was hard to get things. We were ignorant then. We are more knowledgeable now, and more  aware of things. My children are more aware of things, and hopefully my grandchildren are more aware of ways to be educated. I was ignorant of the fact of the world that was around me, which is sad, very sad. And, so in this way, change is good. We have more contact, we have more information. So, it's give and take, some things are worse and some things are better.    Ms. Higgins I'm surprised, Rose, to hear that you didn't do well in English because I find you very articulate and well spoken. How did this come to be?    Ms. Staples: As I said before, I don't feel I was a good student. And I wasn't a good student because I didn't realize at the time that I didn't read well. I didn't read properly. It was only when  I was about twenty-five that I got into reading. I started with magazine articles. Then it became novels. I could read because I saw a different way of reading, I don't know what the problem was, but I think I read in high school a word at a time, whereas, when I became older, I read a phrase at a time. And it made more sense to me.    Ms. Higgins Rose, could you please describe any stories that you recall that have been passed down from generation to generation in your family?     Ms. Staples: There are stories about why my father left  White Russia, which was part of Russia at that time. I guess there were pogroms at that time, and this is the reason that they left. We were actually in very good standing with the community, but his older brother was drafted into the army. And it is not like being drafted into the army here. Once you were drafted into the army there, you disappeared and you went off for years and years and years. And hopefully you would come back. And instead of staying in the army, his older brother deserted. And once you did that, your whole family was persecuted. So basically that is why they left and came here because they couldn't take the persecution anymore. That is one of the stories my father told me. My mother didn't seem to relate any stories about her family. I really feel she had a troubled childhood. She was only allowed to go to the fourth grade. She had to go to work in the family business, a candy store in Brooklyn. And she never really went into details too much because I don't think she was very happy with the whole situation.    Ms. Higgins: Could you tell me also what you feel are the most important legacies that you leave personally to your family and to your friends and to the community at large?    Ms. Staples: I think the main thing is to care. And I don't think you can know what caring really means until you get somewhat older. To me it means not just thinking about other people or, having good thoughts, but actually doing. Just doing. I really don't feel I've done enough of this, and I hope in the years that I have remaining that I'm able to project to people that I really do care. I think you really have to care about other people and in my lifetime, I don't think I've really cared enough about people. But I  think it's never too late to change and to understand what is expected of you. And that is what I think should be expected of people: to care. People have showed me have they have cared,  and I understand how it feels to be at the other end. So I think you have to turn around and do it to other people. You need to give back.    Ms. Higgins: What insights you would like to share with people who might be reading this transcript in the years to come? What advice would you give to future generations?    Ms. Staples: Well, I feel you have to be proud and be happy that I lived in a community like this.  I'm always very happy to say that I lived here all my life and I've been happy here. I like to try to relate little stories about my life as I'm doing right here, because if you don't tell people what happened, no one will ever know. If you are standing alone in the middle of the forest and laughing, if nobody hears you laugh, are you really making a sound? So basically it comes down to this: If you don't tell people you are happy here, don't tell people how nice it can be here, and how happy you were, how will they know that it was nice, or it is nice?    Ms. Higgins: What are the major things you think we should work on preserving in Monmouth County? Obviously the quality of life here is pretty good. What would you suggest we work on preserving?    Ms. Staples: History. History. History. Because as I just said, if no one tells the history, no one will know.    Ms. Higgins: We've enjoyed the charming stories of the pavilion and the beach and the school. What were your occupations as a child? We talked about the summer, but what would you do in the winter?    Ms. Staples:  In the wintertime, there were many things to do because,  there were a lot of little ponds, natural ponds, swamps, and bogs. Now you think swamps and bogs, what could you possibly do there? But in the wintertime when the weather became very cold, the bogs and swamps were the first things to freeze. So you could go ice-skating and it was fairly safe because most of these areas, if you fell in, you only went up to your knees in the water. So, it was nice. And then there were the lakes that we would gather and go ice-skating. And it didn't matter whether you had a pair of ice skates or not. You could just get on the ice and slide around in your shoes. It was a really nice feeling. We were also  able to go out to the road in the front of your house and sleigh ride all day long  maybe you would be out there three hours and maybe one car would come by. It was so safe to be able to do that.    Ms. Higgins:Thank you very much for sharing these memories and observations with us today.    Ms. Staples: I have enjoyed talking with you. Thank you, too.
MonmouthCounty;Robert Wilcox;1909;2000;Robert Wilcox, 1909, 2000          Remembering The 20th Century: An Oral History of Monmouth County      Mr. Robert Wilcox with his '89 Firebird in 1998  Date of Interview: June 23, 2000  Name of Interviewer: Flora Higgins  Premises of Interview: Mr. Wilcox's home, Oceanport, NJ  Birthdate of Subject: March 5, 1909  Deceased: January 21, 2004      Ms. Higgins: Where were you born?    Mr. Wilcox: I was born in Springfield, Massachusetts, and lived in my earlier years in Springfield. But at an early age, I came down here, always on visits. Sometimes I even went to school down here. I attended the elementary school in North Long Branch. The principal there was Conrow, who now has a school named after her in Long Branch. From that time on, whenever the opportunity presented itself, I was down here. I would come either by train, or boat, or whatever. My grandparents were here, and that was my mother's home. And I got to love this place…the environment, everything, and the salt-air mostly. The men folks, including my grandfather, two of my uncles, and several of my other relatives, gained their total income, the means of raising and educating their families from this river and its products. We gathered from time to time down at what my uncle called his oyster house. And I heard a lot of talk about the river, and the names of the various parts of the river. And I heard about their success or lack of it in catching the fish and shellfish, or whatever was income producing at the time.    Ms. Higgins: Would the shellfish be marketed locally?    Mr. Wilcox: Yes. Largely it would consist of cottage owners along the shore sending their chauffeurs over to buy the products. Also at that time, they would put certain products such as eels and other fish in boxes that they would build themselves. And they would put a label on it and call the express office, which would send a truck down and pick it up.    Ms. Higgins: Down from where?    Mr. Wilcox: From the Long Branch station depot of the NY and Long Branch Railroad. It was the Adams Express Company. I remember the label, which had a fish on it. It would then go to Fulton Fish Market in New York. These river men never knew what price it would bring or what income would result until they got word back from the market. Everything in those days was largely a matter of a man's word being his bond. So there was a lot of trust involved.    Ms. Higgins: Did the fish go up by train?    Mr. Wilcox: Yes. Frank Wilcox, an uncle of my father, was the express agent for Adams Express. The Express company was an integral part of the whole train operation. Their employees were responsible for the handling and shipment of all materials by train. Uncle Frank lived on Branchport Avenue and raised a big family. And I have his genealogy right there in my desk.    Ms. Higgins: Where did your people originally come from? What was your mother's maiden name?    Mr. Wilcox: My mother's maiden name was Riddle. The cross-hatched property on the plans that I showed you was her homestead.    Ms. Higgins: The Riddles came from where?    Mr. Wilcox: Grandma Riddle was believed to be from Eatontown.    Ms. Higgins: (Laughter) I was thinking of Ireland, Germany, or England. Eatontown, ok!    Mr. Wilcox: Her maiden name was Lane.    Ms. Higgins: Your people have been here a long time!    Mr. Wilcox: Oh, yes. Both families. Riddle is maternal, and Wilcox is paternal.    Ms. Higgins: When did you actually move down here?    Mr. Wilcox: I didn't move down here permanently until my senior year in high school. But I spent summers and winter holidays here, and time in the North Long Branch school. But I half lived with my grandparents. My father's business took him all over the northeast.    Ms. Higgins: What business was your father in?    Mr. Wilcox: He was a diner manager and operator. He worked for what they called the Club Diner Corporation. When they would start a diner in Pennsylvania, Delaware, New York, or Long Island  they would have real estate people pick out the site for them and appraise it. They would establish a diner there, and they put him in it to run it until it got "off the ground." Then he would go to another place. It was Williamsport, Pennsylvania  Marcus Hook, Pennsylvania  Newark, New Jersey  and Great Neck, Long Island, etc.    Ms. Higgins: So he traveled a lot.    Mr. Wilcox: I wouldn't say traveled a lot, but he changed residences a lot.    Ms. Higgins: Did your family go as a group?    Mr. Wilcox: My mother went with my dad, but as I got older, I was by myself.    Ms. Higgins: What was the major appeal of the Jersey shore for you as a young or middle-aged boy?    Mr. Wilcox: The people and the river. And I just absolutely loved being in a boat of any kind.    Ms. Higgins: Did you ever have a sailboat?    Mr. Wilcox: I had all kinds of boats. I was a charter member of the Shrewsbury Sailing Club.    Ms. Higgins: Is that the River Rats now?    Mr. Wilcox: No, that's Fairhaven.    Ms. Higgins: Did you ever belong to the Monmouth Yacht Club?    Mr. Wilcox: No. I belonged to the Monmouth Ice Boat Club.    Ms. Higgins: Tell us about ice boating.    Mr. Wilcox: Well, those men that worked on the river in my family, many of them were active in ice boating. Records of their participation are included in a book published by Warren Ayres and Byron Briggs, and it's called Shrewsbury River Memoirs. The records of their participation, the results of races they sailed in, and the boats that they simply crewed on are all included in that book.    Ms. Higgins: Is that the Ayres family from Little Silver and Red Bank?    Mr. Wilcox: It's Ayres, but there is more than one family of Ayres, I am sure. Warren Ayres and Byron Briggs both passed away, some time ago. But Warren's son, until recently, had some kind of job at Monmouth University, as a comptroller or something similar.    Ms. Higgins: Do you think winters were colder years ago?    Mr. Wilcox: I had a diary that was loaned to me by Chick Trafford, from Manasquan. It was a personal diary of a land surveyor in Eatontown, and it covered the years from 1879 to 1882. It was just three years, but every day in the diary, he was very careful to include the weather, and the way it appeared to him. If he was to go out and make a survey, then the weather was an item to consider. The weather was also an item if he couldn't go out, he would stay home and write deed descriptions.    Ms. Higgins: Did he think it was colder?    Mr. Wilcox: No. Considering the means of transportation and communication in those days, I don't think there has been any great change at all. Even from the days that I first started ice boating, sailing, racing and building boats, the type of winter we had was of paramount importance to me. And it is important to even the few kids that are still interested in ice boats. It's about the same today as it was then. Many periods of three to four years, we had mild winters. We might not get on the ice once during a whole winter, or on bearable ice. Cap Rice used to say some of them would go out when the ice wouldn't hold a seagull.    Ms. Higgins: When you were a teenager here where would you go for entertainment when you weren't out on the water in your boat?    Mr. Wilcox: Moving pictures in Long Branch would be the number one place. Depending on the season  the other place would be the Long Branch pier. They had a building out on the pier where they always had dance bands, etc. Toward the end of that period, it drifted into marathon dancing. Some of the participants in the marathon dancing are still in Long Branch.    Ms. Higgins: Well, that's pretty good. I hadn't known that.    Mr. Wilcox: Red Skelton, the comedian, was one of the entertainers at that time. In fact, I think he got his start right here in Long Branch.    Ms. Higgins: Do you remember the name of the club out on the pier?    Mr. Wilcox: No.    Ms. Higgins: Do you remember when it came down?    Mr. Wilcox: No. So far as it being a dance hall, that stopped a long time ago, about the beginning of the Depression, in the middle 1930s.    Ms. Higgins: Can you give us any of your recollections about the Depression?    Mr. Wilcox: I had started as an engineer with the old New Jersey State Highway Department, which is now the Department of Transportation, NJDOT. I was working with that department  I had started there in 1928. All during the Depression, I was fortunate enough to draw a paycheck. I got paid, and I worked right on through it. But many of the men I worked with weren't so fortunate. I remember that they had an arrangement with the WPA, where some of these employees with us were on a schedule where they would work two weeks, and then they would be off two weeks. There was enough income from that so they could keep their families together, I presume. All of them did that I was acquainted with.    Ms. Higgins: Many of the people I interview have a lot of comments about the current state of transportation in New Jersey. Would you care to contrast between the transportation in the 1920s and 1930s and the transportation now? Or maybe what we could have done differently?    Mr. Wilcox: I worked with the department for forty-three years, and I didn't retire until 1972. Up until that time, everything was centered on new roads and extensions of old roads. But that was just about the time when they started thinking that instead of building more new roads, even though the old ones sometimes seemed inadequate, they had to start spending more money on improving the existing facilities, especially in the area of bridges. So from then until now, that has been the direction that they are moving in. And it's taking an awful lot of funding to carry out a program of maintenance, but they seem to be doing it successfully.    Ms. Higgins: The Red Bank bridge is finished now.    Mr. Wilcox: Yes, right. Well, there is another example of it. That thing was built a long time ago.    Ms. Higgins: Do you think we should put more emphasis on the rail service? A lot of people used to get around on the trolley and the train.    Mr. Wilcox: There has to be an encouragement for development of a means of transportation other than automobile. They have already begun that with the electrification of our lines here.    Ms. Higgins: How about water transportation?    Mr. Wilcox: Well, water transportation is helping a whole lot. Of course the county is going ahead with the plans for the new terminal at Belford, and that will be an added help. I wish them success, but there are a lot of people who don't think it will really succeed. It doesn't make any difference whether it's boats, trains, or buses. No matter what means of transportation you are talking about, it always gets back to parking and access.    Ms. Higgins: You said you used to go to the movies. Do you remember any movies you particularly liked in the old days? One interviewee said the first movie he ever saw was Gone with the Wind, and he said it has been all down hill since then.    Mr. Wilcox: Yes, that's right. I agree with that. I used to be a cowboy fan. I liked Tom Mix and William Farnum and even Gene Autrey toward the end. There was also Roy Rogers and his wife.    Ms. Higgins: Do you remember any restaurants that you would visit when you all went out to dinner sometimes?    Mr. Wilcox: Earlier in my youth, I wasn't in the social strata that would go out to restaurants much. But the partying group, as they would refer to them today, would go to seafood restaurants. There was one right across the river, on property that you can see from here. Green Gables was the name. And, of course, let's not forget Price's Hotel, by the bridge.    Ms. Higgins: What time frame was that popular? And which bridge, this one out here?    Mr. Wilcox: It was always known as the Pleasure Bay Bridge.    Ms. Higgins: Mr. Wilcox, could you tell us why your family always referred to this particular peninsula as Slocum's Island?    Mr. Wilcox: What was your question prior to mentioning about Slocum's Island?    Ms. Higgins: I asked about the Price's Hotel. I hadn't heard of that. When did it go away?    Mr. Wilcox: Price's Hotel burned around 1950.    Ms. Higgins: It was an institution then, right? I imagine Green Gables restaurant sold seafood that your family might have caught?    Mr. Wilcox: Price's did, and so did Green Gables. And mostly eels and crabs, and at the beginning, oysters.    Ms. Higgins: Why at the beginning?    Mr. Wilcox: Oysters were a real delicacy. Shrewsbury River oysters were famous world-wide. So Red Bank always referred to their river as the North Shrewsbury River. One of the results of that is the Ice Boat Club in Red Bank is called the North Shrewsbury Ice Boat Club.    Ms. Higgins: Is it on the Shrewsbury?    Mr. Wilcox: No, it's on the Navesink. By action of the State's Economic Development and Conservation Commission, they changed the name. And that was somewhere around the 1970s, I guess. From then on, the Red Bank River was the Navesink River, and our river was the Shrewsbury River.    Ms. Higgins: What happened to the oysters?    Mr. Wilcox: The same thing that happened in other places. Some disease got into them and wiped them out. The same thing happened in Delaware Bay, and it's beginning in Chesapeake Bay in Maryland.    Ms. Higgins: Are oysters relatively fragile?    Mr. Wilcox: No, but there is a mite that gets into them. Scientists can tell you more about it.    Ms. Higgins: But there was no question about the purity of the fish, or if there was, when did it occur? When did you begin to feel that the shellfish were not clean enough to eat?    Mr. Wilcox: When they were no longer there to be tonged.    Ms. Higgins: Tonged?    Mr. Wilcox: Yes, big oyster tongs were used.    Ms. Higgins: How about the clams, was there any clam digging out here?    Mr. Wilcox: Oh, yes. There still are soft clams and hard clams, but they are not legally harvested in most of the Shrewsbury and Navesink. They cannot harvest them because of the water quality. They have done all kinds of things to overcome that. They have taken seed shellfish that they catch in these two rivers, take them down to Barnegat Bay into water that is not polluted, plant them, let them grow, harvest them, and then bring them back here. Then they subject them to ultraviolet rays, or some means that I am not familiar with, removing any pollution that might be there.    Ms. Higgins: Before we leave the subject of when you were very young, could you share with us some of your memories of school time?    Mr. Wilcox: The homestead was on Riddle Avenue, and I was going to the Church Street School in North Long Branch. And I remember that I walked the entire distance.    Ms. Higgins: How many miles would that be?    Mr. Wilcox: A couple. It is about a mile from the Riddle Avenue homestead up to Florence and Atlantic, and then about a mile from there to North Long Branch.    Ms. Higgins: And when you got there, how many children would be there? Was it a one-room schoolroom?    Mr. Wilcox: No, they were in classes. I attended the fourth and seventh grades over there. Many of my classmates went on to bigger things. And I didn't do so bad myself.    Ms. Higgins: What did you do? What did you go on to?    Mr. Wilcox: Highway construction, and outdoors most of the time. Toward the end of my employment, I was in an office in Metuchen. I always had a state car for transportation. Then I found out where the money was, and I had an opportunity to go into Trenton. I commuted every day from 1967 to 1972, when I retired. The first four years of it, I had a state car. The last year I traveled in my own car, when they started looking at carpools and that sort of thing.    Ms. Higgins: Were you involved in the planning and construction of the Turnpike and Garden State Parkway?    Mr. Wilcox: No, I missed that. Many of the people that I worked with went there, but it was mostly upper level, that is a higher level than myself.    Ms. Higgins: When we moved down here, Route 35 and Route 36 were just two-lane roads. That was in the 1950s. And then all of a sudden, everything had six lanes. Good job!    Mr. Wilcox: That was during the time when I was in Trenton. No, that was before I went to Trenton. But I was assisting with the public hearings. I remember hearings that were conducted in the fire house in Belford, and we were getting ready to put in a center divider. Also the same thing happened in the hearing that we conducted in Middletown, for a center barrier there. And the people were very much against that. The ones that were most against it were business people on the wrong side of the road. Their customers would have to go to the next u-turn and come back. But the way it has worked out, that was the only way to go with what pavement and what right-of-way they had to work with.    Ms. Higgins: Would you care to comment on the changes you have seen in Monmouth County over the past many years?    Mr. Wilcox: The only thing I can think of is the great expansion in the health care facilities and the facilities for senior citizens.    Ms. Higgins: When you needed medical care when you were growing up and as a young man, where would you go from here?    Mr. Wilcox: Down on Riddle Avenue, it was always Dr. Chasey.    Ms. Higgins: Did he make house calls?    Mr. Wilcox: Oh, certainly! That was a given. They used to call them homeopathic doctors. There were very few specialists then. Now everybody is a specialist.    Ms. Higgins: It's hard to find a general practitioner.    Mr. Wilcox: Yes.    Ms. Higgins: Tell me about some of the milestones in your life. We talked about getting a job at the highway department, and you were too young for World War I and probably too old for World War II, right?    Mr. Wilcox: I was in the United States Army for three and a half years during World War II, and I never left the country. I was a little bit older then. I used to go in the mess hall or into the latrine, and they would call me grandpa. And I wasn't that old, I was only in my thirties.    Ms. Higgins: Were you drafted?    Mr. Wilcox: No, I enlisted.    Ms. Higgins: Do you remember any of your uncles or older friends who might have served in World War I?    Mr. Wilcox: Yes, one of my mother's brothers did, and I referred to him as Uncle George. He was in the Navy in the submarine service. He never went overseas either. He trained at Newport, Rhode Island. I still have photos of him in his diving suit in the submarine service. They dove to recover the spent torpedoes. His mother, my grandmother, had him late in life. So when we went anywhere together, there wasn't too much difference in our ages. And he would say to me, "Robert, please don't call me your uncle."    Ms. Higgins: Do you have any recollections of Fort Monmouth?    Mr. Wilcox: That's where I enlisted, that's where I served. I enlisted over there, and I had taken engineering drafting at Newark Tech. I didn't go to college, but I had one year of engineering at Newark Tech, which is what they called it in those days. It is Newark Technical School, or New Jersey Institute of Technology, now. There I learned surveying under an excellent teacher by the name of Barbehenn. And I took what they called engineering drawing then and surveying, of course. There was also a compulsory English, which I didn't finish. But this is about the Jersey shore and is not about me, as I understand it.    Ms. Higgins: Well, we feel that the people who made the Jersey shore "are" the Jersey shore. So we are interested in your life as well. Do you have any memories of the Morro Castle catastrophe?    Mr. Wilcox: Oh, yes, I remember the Morro Castle thing. And I remember the storm that we had when that was all going on, when the Morro Castle was being towed from Manasquan Inlet toward New York, when it broke lose and came ashore right off the Asbury Park convention hall. It was less than 200 yards off the convention hall.    Ms. Higgins: Did you go see it?    Mr. Wilcox: Oh, yes, everybody went to see it and took pictures of it. One of the strangest things about it was you would get in your car and drive down Ocean Avenue, and you would make those turns into Loch Arbor and Allenhurst. Then all of a sudden, here's this ship that looked like it was almost in front of you. And it was so in close to shore, and you could see it above the houses and above everything. It was strange!    Ms. Higgins: And yet even though it was so close, there was big loss of life.    Mr. Wilcox: There was a big loss of life from people jumping off the stern with or without life jackets. They were mostly tourists and a lot of them elderly. When I first went to Elizabeth and was attending Newark Tech to learn surveying at night, I got my first job with Grassman & Kreh Consulting Engineers. Their office manager was the type that walks around with all the keys to the building on his belt. And he was there from day one, and he knew everything about the business. He was kind to me and took me under his wing, and he taught me how to use logarithms and slide rules, which were the forerunners of calculators. He was so good to me and prepared me, and he got me pay raises and everything else. He never took a vacation until that summer. He finally took his family, got on the Morro Castle, and they were on the Morro Castle when it came aground. Many went overboard off the stern, and he was the only one in his family that didn't make it to shore.    Ms. Higgins: There was a big surf, was there not?    Mr. Wilcox: Oh yes. We had a howling, northeast storm when all that was going on.    Ms. Higgins: Did you ever take your sailboats outside?    Mr. Wilcox: No, it was mostly river sailing.    Ms. Higgins: Did they ever have any scows down here?    Mr. Wilcox: That's a little thing that's in my book a little bit. The book…well I shouldn't get into this.    Ms. Higgins: Go ahead.    Mr. Wilcox: I will be everlastingly grateful to Ayres and Briggs for putting that book together, the Shrewsbury River Memoirs. But it omitted so many things about boats on the river. When I was growing up, the principal sporting activity on the river in sailing was done out of the Rumson Country Club. They had a whole fleet of scows, center board scows.    Ms. Higgins: 'E' scows or 'M' scows?    Mr. Wilcox: The big ones, those are the 'E' scows. You have to differentiate between the center board scows and the bilge board scows. But they had center board scows, and most of them were built by Jerolaman's Boat Works, in Monmouth Beach.    Ms. Higgins: So did you sail scows?    Mr. Wilcox: No. I crewed on one just one time. The Shrewsbury River Memoirs had a picture of one of them finishing a race right out here in front of this place.    Ms. Higgins: How was it rigged? Did it have a lot of sail?    Mr. Wilcox: Just a jib and main sail, that's all. The Rumson Club scows, as I remember, flew spinnakers.    Ms. Higgins: Do you have any comments on the boat builders in Highlands? The Jersey skiff, that was not a sailboat, was it?    Mr. Wilcox: There has been so much play on that title. The New Jersey Speed Skiff was designed by Harold Seamen, right here on this river at Branchport. The Long Branch Ice Boat & Yacht Club was instrumental in getting it recognized by the American Power Boat Association as a racing class. Our club, the Long Branch Ice Boat & Yacht Club, conducted inboard and outboard races right here. The course is right out in front here. I laid it out, and it was a mile around for inboard and outboards both. Of course the outboards attracted most of the attention.    Ms. Higgins: Mr. Wilcox has a daughter, who went to the University of New Hampshire. She received her undergraduate degree in English, and then went to Michigan State and got a masters degree in English. Tell us more about your family. How did you and your wife meet? Did you meet here in Monmouth County?    Mr. Wilcox: We met at Fort Monmouth, while I was in the Army as a drafting specialist. They didn't know too much about what a draftsman did, but I had a drafting room. I had three employees working for me, and that was all. I was in charge of the drafting room for the officer's school, which was differentiated from the enlisted men's school. My wife was executive secretary to the commandant of the officer's school. And that's how we met. The commandant intercepted one of my calls to her, which caused her a great deal of embarrassment. (Laughter) She was the greatest thing that ever happened to me! What a woman! After we had been married over thirty-three years, she was stricken with a massive coronary. And I never remarried.    Ms. Higgins: She must have been quite young.    Mr. Wilcox: She was twelve years younger than I. We had one daughter, and two sons. One son is my landlord. My wife and I built that part of the house, and we raised the three children in it.    Ms. Higgins: What was your wife's name?    Mr. Wilcox: Susan. And she was a Cornish, and I have all the genealogy on her family, all the way back to 1623.    Ms. Higgins: What would you like to tell people that are going to be listening to or reading this interview in fifty or seventy years?    Mr. Wilcox: I have a proclamation to me. You had to admire and respect my family because of what they had accomplished with so little to work with, and how much they enjoyed life, and how they were able to raise big families. You can't go anywhere without finding some of them, especially in Monmouth County. But I don't have any wishes for people to think of me. The mayor before the one that issued that proclamation came after Mayor Tommy Cavanaugh, who is now a Superior Court Judge in Monmouth County. He issued a proclamation similar to that, and for the same purpose.    Ms. Higgins: This proclamation is for a Lifetime Achievement Award for Volunteerism given to Mr. Wilcox.    Mr. Wilcox: I was the recipient of the Mayor's Lifetime Achievement Award for Volunteerism, and that was from the previous Mayor, Tommy Cavanaugh. He created that thing, and I was the first selected to receive it.    Ms. Higgins: Mr. Wilcox, I think people have a lot of respect, regard and admiration for you, as well. Oceanport is a most lovely town, and I see you have had a big part in it.    Mr. Wilcox: I was President of Shore Regional Board of Education. I had a big hand in the selection of the site and the construction of the building. I was president of that board during the first year of operation. Peter Cooper in West Long Branch was president when we dedicated the building in September of 1962. I took over when they elected the new president in February of 1963. So I had the term the last of 1963 and the first of 1964. But in doing that, I never had a chance to award the diplomas to the graduating class. I missed that.    Ms. Higgins: When you were a youngster coming down from Massachusetts, how would you get into Monmouth County? How did you get down to this area?    Mr. Wilcox: I was living in White Plains about eight of those years, and we used to ride the railroad, which is called the Westchester & Boston Railroad. Most people rode the New York Central from White Plains into New York, but we rode the Westchester & Boston. And you had to get off and get on the el or the subway, down to 23rd Street, where the boats docked. We had four steamboats operating out of here, Tom Patten, Mary Patten, Elberon, and the Little Silver. Red Bank had two boats, the Albertina and the Seabird.    Ms. Higgins: So you came down by steamboat?    Mr. Wilcox: Yes, and then I got on the trolley car and got off at 2nd Avenue & Broadway in Long Branch. Then I got another trolley car that took us from there back to Pleasure Bay. We got off at Pleasure Bay and walked down Florence Avenue and Patten Avenue to Riddle Avenue. That homestead was on Riddle Avenue, named so by Joe Riddle, on the south side of the street. Holmes Riddle, his brother, built on the north side of the street. Holmes raised a lot of boys and Joe raised a lot of girls. The boys from Holmes' side of the road married Irish maids, who worked in the cottages on the beach. There was Teresa, Catherine, Cecelia, and I don't remember the other one. Joe Riddle had all girls, and they married all kinds of guys, including some Wilcoxes. I told you about the express agent at Long Branch who was an uncle of my father.    Ms. Higgins: Yes.    Mr. Wilcox: He brought Robert L. Wilcox, my uncle, and his brother Arthur Vinton Wilcox from Chatham, New York down here to work for him in the express business for the summer. And that's how both of them got acquainted with Riddle girls. So the two brothers married two sisters: Lottie and Ella married Art and Rob. And this goes on and on.    Ms. Higgins: We can talk a little bit more about some of the things here in Monmouth County in general, and in Oceanport. Would you tell us about the Pleasure Bay Bridge?    Mr. Wilcox: Pleasure Bay Bridge was a swing span, and it was in practically the same location as the present bridge. The span was busy opening with the Patten Line running passenger and cargo service back and forth to New York. The local kids, including me, loved to get on the bridge when there was a boat coming up the river. And we would ride the swing span, and go out with it. You could see firsthand the crew and the passengers on the boat. And of course, we were always fishing in the summer for crabs, and snapper blues.    Ms. Higgins: From the bridge?    Mr. Wilcox: From the bridge.    Ms. Higgins: Where did the Patten Line go from…it went into New York?    Mr. Wilcox: It left from the 23rd Street Pier at New York and went to Pleasure Bay Pier at Long Branch.  It would pick up passengers at Battery Park on the way down. I'm not sure about all of them, but the Red Bank boats, which ran about the same time, there were two of them. They were the Albertina and the other name escapes me now. The four boats here were the Mary Patten, the Tom Patten, Elberon, and Little Silver. The Tom didn't run here very long, and it was sold to Maryland and ran ferry service from the eastern shore to Baltimore.    Ms. Higgins: How many people would it carry? How big are these boats?    Mr. Wilcox: I think about 120-150 feet, or somewhere around that.    Ms. Higgins: Why did they stop this service? It seemed like a very efficient way to take people into New York. Why did they all stop?    Mr. Wilcox: I think trucks and trains really ran them out of business, especially the trucks. They would have to truck the cargo to the boat and then truck it to the vendor on the shore, so there was extra handling and time. It wasn't a quick trip, but I don't suppose trains were either.    Ms. Higgins: When did they cease?    Mr. Wilcox: They ran as late as about 1930. There were two boats from Keansburg that ran in here, and they were the last ones. Two of the boats, I think one was the Mary Patten and the other was one of the Keansburg boats, spent their last days just the other side of the bridge. Then the Depression in the 1930s came, and local people hacked at them to get the lumber for firewood. In fact, at our boat club, the gavel and its base were made by a club member out of a piece of oak off the paddle wheel of the Mary. And that gavel may still be in use. I haven't seen it lately, but it still might be around. I rode the boat with my parents when we were living in White Plains, New York. We rode the Westchester & Boston Railroad into New York. And one time we rode the Red Bank boat in, and it was an all day trip. These boats made stops at Atlantic Highlands, at Bown's Dock, in Fairhaven, and went into Red Bank. You got off the boats at Red Bank, got on the trolley car, came by trolley from Red Bank to here, and then walked from Pleasure Bay Park down to Riddle Town, which is right across the river. And that was at least a twelve-hour trip, I know. It took from early morning until late afternoon, and it was extremely tiring.    Ms. Higgins: It makes the Garden State Parkway not look so bad, right? When did the turnpike come in? I am thinking about the competition between the truckers and the boating people.    Mr. Wilcox: Well, when the turnpike first began, it was a state project. It was done by our highway department. And our highway department was working on taxpayer money, which was limited then as it is now. And it reached a point where none of it had been built yet, and they saw what funding was needed, so they created the Turnpike Commission. And they worked with the government bonds.    Ms. Higgins: How did the New Jersey Turnpike change Monmouth County?    Mr. Wilcox: Oh, the turnpike and the parkway just caused a really great boom, not only in Monmouth County, but more so in Ocean and points south. The Ocean County people could buy $10,000 house and then they could commute to work on the Garden State Parkway. And they would be in the City and North Jersey in an hour or less.    Ms. Higgins: Tell us, please, your recollections of the lifesaving service.    Mr. Wilcox: My grandfather, Joe Riddle, lived on Riddle Avenue. His brother, Holmes, lived across the street. They both raised big families, and one family was boys and one family was girls. And never the twain should mix! I could go on and on with this. At that time, the need for coastal protection and lifesaving service became necessary. So the United States created the United States Lifesaving Service. They built lifesaving stations at regular intervals along the shore from Sandy Hook to Cape May.    Ms. Higgins: This was in about what year?    Mr. Wilcox: Both my grandfather and his brother began their work in 1887. The lifesaving service was from 1887 to 1925, but I don't think that either one of them was still working in the lifesaving service in 1925. But maybe they worked up until 1920 or so.    Ms. Higgins: Was that a job, or was it like the volunteer fire department?    Mr. Wilcox: No, it was a paid job. And I don't think the pay was much. They worked shifts, so that there was a required number of men available around the clock. These shifts ran for either a week or two weeks, and they lived at the station during that time.    Ms. Higgins: Where are the stations?    Mr. Wilcox: One station was at Sandy Hook, and that was called the Spermacetti Cove Station  then coming south, the next one was at Sea Bright. Then there was one at Monmouth Beach. I think there were others in between at one time, but those were the first and main ones. The Sandy Hook Station is still there, and it has been taken over by the federal government, and it has been all fixed up. I don't know if it is used by employees of the government or not.    Ms. Higgins: Was your grandfather's organization a Monmouth County organization, a Coastal one, or did it have state backing?    Mr. Wilcox: His organization was known at the U.S. Life Saving Service. My grandfather is buried in the cemetery at West Long Branch. His stone was bought and paid for by the Surfman's Mutual Benefit Association. I suppose that was a forerunner of our unions.    Ms. Higgins: Who was saved by the various stations?    Mr. Wilcox: Boats that came from foreign countries and broke up in the storms, for the most part. In a letter to headquarters, my uncle got the names of some of the wrecks that my grandfather worked on. One of them was the Emma K. Buckley, but then south of here, a boat called the New Era went down. And you have heard about that, probably. A large number of people lost their lives, and they are buried in the old First Church cemetery in a mass grave with a huge monument, which is still there.    Ms. Higgins: Would you please comment on the relationship of your grandparents, your parents, and yourself to this river.    Mr. Wilcox: All the men on the river, that's all they did. They harvested their shellfish almost year-round. Even in the wintertime, they dug clams by cutting slots through the ice. In the wintertime when he couldn't work, my uncle sat backwards on a chair and knitted his own nets, which they call fykes. And I remember in the spring when I was going to school, he got me out of bed at four o'clock in the morning, and I got in the boat with him and went out. He had eighteen fykes and sixty eel pots set down on the river. We emptied those into our boat and brought them back, and then I would go to school after a second breakfast. But that's all that generation did. And then some of the next generation continued working on the water. But every year, there were fewer river men. A few of the people around here were working in town. But the bulk of them were people who in the wintertime, when the cottages all along the beach were empty, maintained those places. They did all the painting, carpentry work, and landscaping improvements then. As soon as the summer season came, some of those cottage owners would move their whole families in. Then the grocery stores would have plenty of business. So the kitchen help would stock up the pantry for the summer. Joe Riddle, who was working in the lifesaving service, he was off a week in between his shifts. And when he was off, he was working on the river, too. He had his own boat and equipment. In those days, they used to put a net in the water and run it out maybe fifty feet, and then fifty feet across and then back, so it was closed. They would take the crabs and stock them in there. They would go in and overhaul the crabs, and the ones that were approaching the shed were put in the shedder car. And they always kept a hard crab car handy for the chauffeurs and others that would come in and ask for hard crabs. Soft crabs needed careful handling. When they shed the hard shell, they were defenseless against predators. To become marketable, they were kept separate in salt water containers until they were sufficiently hardened for delivery to the consumer.    Ms. Higgins: Thank you very much, Mr. Wilcox for this very interesting interview.    Mr. Wilcox: You're welcome. I woud like to compliment you on the ease that you put me in.    Ms. Higgins: Thank you.      
MonmouthCounty;Richard Frenkiel;1943;2000;Richard Frenkiel, 1943, 2000          Remembering The 20th Century: An Oral History of Monmouth County      Richard Frenkiel, present day  Date of Interview: June 12, 2000  Name Of Interviewer: Connie Paul  Premises of Interview: Central Jersey Regional Library Cooperative, Freehold, NJ  Birth date of subject: March 4, 1943    Ms. Paul: When and how did you come to Monmouth County?    Mr. Frenkiel: I was born in Brooklyn, Brighton Beach. I ended up in Monmouth County because I took a job with Bell Labs.    Ms. Paul: When was that?    Mr. Frenkiel: 1963.    Ms. Paul: Was your family in Brooklyn?    Dick Frenkiel and Daughter  Dick Frenkiel and his daughter    Mr. Frenkiel: My mother and father and two sisters, and we didn't have a whole lot of relatives.  My mother had a couple of brothers and sisters living in New York.  She was from a big family with thirteen kids of whom about half lived. My father immigrated to the United States by himself, so we had few relatives from my father's side.     Ms. Paul: Where did he come from?    Mr. Frenkiel: Poland. Both my mother's family and father came from Poland.     Ms. Paul: Where did you go to school?    Mr. Frenkiel: In the local public school and then to the Brooklyn Technical High School. Then I went to Tufts University.  It is not particularly known as an engineering school.    Ms. Paul: Why did you choose that school?    Mr. Frenkiel: My sister had gone there.    Ms. Paul: And she liked it?    Mr. Frenkiel: She was still there. It makes you feel more comfortable, I guess, at a place knowing somebody is there. So I went. I graduated in 1963 and took a job with Bell Labs in Holmdel.    Ms. Paul: And where did you live next?    Mr. Frenkiel: I got married that December. My wife was a student at Tufts, also. She got a job in East Brunswick High School, teaching Latin, and I got a job at Bell Labs.  I was also going to Rutgers for my masters at the time. We lived in East Brunswick because it was convenient for her. It was also midway between Rutgers and Bell Labs. We lived in an apartment there for three years and then moved to Manalapan. In a Hovnanian house, which  cost $22,450, if I remember correctly.    Ms. Paul: There were a lot of other people doing the same thing at the same time.    Mr. Frenkiel: Oh, yes. This was a strange area in that time. Hovnanian was really the first big development in Manalapan. There was also Levitt's US Homes. Between the two of them, though, there were maybe 1000 homes, and the rest was all farmland. We used to go to Freehold to shop. The nearest supermarket was FoodTown on Route 9 and Schank Road.    Ms. Paul: What was your job in Bell Labs?     Mr. Frenkiel: Well, that was kind of odd. I was a mechanical engineer and Bell Labs is a pretty electronic place. They use mechanical engineers, but not in a fundamental way.  I think I mostly took the job because they have the Masters Degree Program.  I figured I couldn't lose  I'd come out with a degree and go somewhere else if I didn't like it. They had me designing what were called heavy duty announcement machines. These were like big drums. Imagine a drum about two feet in diameter with fifty to one hundred audio tracks on it, each one with a recording head riding on it.  And they would have it where one track would say, "At the tone the time will be." Another track would say, "One" or "Two," and they would splice together those messages. In the pre-computer days, that's how you made a message that told you the time of day or the number you have called. So they would program it to make a message out of these ninety-six options on the tracks. And that is what I did for two years, maybe a little more. And one day they came in and said, "We need some people to work on this idea called cellular." This was in 1966.  I worked on that for sixteen years. In the beginning, I knew nothing about what I was doing. I mean, as a mechanical engineer, I wasn't particularly adept in radio. But they made me into a systems engineer, which means somebody who worries about the whole system and how things go together, and what does the handset have to be doing, and what does the base station have to do, what does the switch have to do? And I liked it a lot. That was a good project.    Ms. Paul: Well, it had a profound effect.    Mr. Frenkiel: Yes. And we kind of knew that. We didn't know how much. For example, we were hoping to have a million customers by 1990 perhaps. And we exceeded that by a lot. I think we knew it was a big deal because people wanted radio-telephones in their cars even then. It was like a luxury item in those days. So we knew a lot of people wanted it. There was a waiting list with 50,000 people on it to get service.    Ms. Paul: As soon as you invented it?    Mr. Frenkiel: Before. There was a big pent up demand. And we kind of knew that the radios would get smaller. But when we ran our first trials, the radio weighed about thirty pounds, I think. It went in the trunk of your car and then there was a telephone hanging on the dashboard. And it took about, oh, I don't know, maybe five years for it to get to be something you could carry around in your hand, which was then about the size of a brick. And I think it weighed two pounds. Nowadays, it weighs three or four ounces and rattles around in your shirt pocket. And that's what made all the difference. We saw it as the car telephone, but what it really turned out to be was the pocket telephone. And that is why there are 200 million people using them in the world today.    Dick with President Clinton  Dick Frenkiel with President Clinton  Ms. Paul: You received a Presidential Award as one of the inventors of this?    Mr. Frenkiel: Yes. Two of us got it.    Ms. Paul: Who is the other person?    Mr. Frenkiel: A guy named Joel Engel, who I worked with in the earliest days. There were hundreds of people working on this. It is hard for any one person to seem like he is responsible for anything. But, since I have admitted that, they wanted to give somebody an award for it, and I am pleased that it was us. But as I said, hundreds of people were working on it in my company alone.    Ms. Paul: Let's talk about Bell Labs for a minute. Bell Labs at that point was part of AT&T, right?    Mr. Frenkiel: Yes. In fact it was called the Bell System at that point. There were three phases. When I started working there, it was the Bell System, and that meant New Jersey Bell, New York, New England, Chesapeake and Potomac right across to the Pacific. There were a whole bunch of Operating Companies, and then there was AT&T, which was Headquarters. There was Western Electric, which was manufacturing. There was Bell Labs, which designed stuff. The breakup of the Bell System broke off the service from AT&T, Western and Bell Labs, where the telephone companies went their own way. That happened right when cellular happened. We argued with the FCC for fifteen years that they should give these channels to the Bell System, because we could build the best system nationwide. And they finally agreed to give us half the spectrum, finally  and this was in about 1981. And then we were planning, and building, and getting started. A year later, they announced they were breaking up the Bell System. And the way it went, AT&T did not get the system, it went to a lot of telephone companies. So it was kind of a bittersweet moment. We had worked on this for so many years, and it was being built, but the company that we were still in, which was AT&T, didn't get the service. They have it now because they bought it back. We had to pay twelve billion dollars to get back what we had invented in the first place.    Ms. Paul: I was walking on the Boardwalk with some people this weekend, and somehow the subject came up again about how it was that we had the phone system that the entire world envied, and then it was dismantled. And people are still arguing about whether or not that was a good thing, whether it should or shouldn't have been done.    Mr. Frenkiel: Look at the United States economy, and at those things that AT&T used to have as a monopoly. If we hadn't broken up the Bell System, the Bell System would be a big part of the whole US economy. So another way to look at it is that it had to happen. It released a lot of energy. Monopolies tend to be stodgy  AT&T could not have done the Internet. AT&T would have done it a different way. In fact, they tried to. But they thought in terms of a centralized organization and money didn't matter so much, because they were a monopoly. So I really think that it has been for the best. It has gotten a lot more competitive and a lot cheaper. I mean, look at long distance rates.    Ms. Paul: AT&T certainly has had an enormous impact on Monmouth County. It is a huge employer in Monmouth County and a preferential kind of employer because it is so white collar for the most part. It has had an enormous impact on a lot of the communities, certainly Freehold, Holmdel. Lots of people have worked for that company.    Mr. Frenkiel: It's been a good employer for the people, but less so today, I think. When it was a monopoly, it could afford to be more generous. It was just an easier place to work. No place is easy now. If you count all the pieces, New Jersey Bell, Bell Atlantic, and AT&T, and research, it is bigger than ever. And it is still a good place to work, but probably not as good as it once was.    Ms. Paul: My stepdaughter works for AT&T. She actually just finished working six years there and is taking a leave to go get her Ph.D. in Statistics. But she has found it a difficult place in a lot of ways because the structure that used to be so mentoring, with employee development, is largely gone. It is a more difficult place, but still, an interesting, productive part of the economy.    Mr. Frenkiel: Its big challenge today, I think, is behaving like the small, fast, entrepreneurial companies. These days, more and more often both AT&T and Lucent are buying the little companies that did the things they wish they had done. It is hard to develop the right product. AT&T is a telephone company. They are not a computer company. And with the switching of everything to Internet, they no longer automatically have the technology that no one else has. Now they are one of many companies. And a lot of companies are developing great new products. AT&T and Lucent are buying most of them at a very high price, which is not so good for people working at AT&T and Lucent. My son worked there. He had a couple of projects in a row that he was working on when suddenly they bought a company that made that product and they just disbanded a team. They gave him something else to do eventually, but it is discouraging.    Ms. Paul: How long did you work for Bell Labs/AT&T?    Mr. Frenkiel: Thirty years. I retired in December of 1993. After thirty years you get vested in a pension plan, and can immediately take a pension.    Ms. Paul: And what have you been doing since then?      Dick Frenkiel (left) with his son and grandson  Mr. Frenkiel: Well, my son was newly married, and he and his wife had a child. They were buying a new house which wasn't ready yet, so they moved in with us. And it was kind of funny. I mean, everyone was going to work or school  my wife, my son, and my son's wife were all going to work. Even the baby went to day care. So every morning everyone disappeared, and I was there. I cleaned the house, I shopped, cooked, and I found it very satisfying, after thirty years of pressure to perform, to be doing things that were very controllable. I don't know that I would have wanted to do that for the rest of my life. But for a year, I enjoyed it a lot.  I did it for a year and two weeks, I think. And then I went to Rutgers. An old friend of mine was in charge of the research lab there and he asked me to join him. So I went there and started working about half time. A few consulting gigs would come in now and then for people like me. I had a very interesting job consulting in Thailand a couple of times with a friend of mine. The thing about that, I felt, was I had the chance to do what I never would have done if I had stayed in Bell Labs.    Ms. Paul: I know you have been involved in Manalapan politics. When did you start that part of your life and what did you get involved in?    Mr. Frenkiel: That was funny. I'd never liked politics much. It was not the sort of thing I would have ever said that I'd be involved in. After I retired, some people I knew who were in township politics came to me and asked me to be on the Zoning Board. And I said yes, that is something I ought to do. If you are asked to do something like that it is sort of public service to your town. And it turned out to be very interesting. I spent a year on the Planning Board, during which time we had this very controversial water tower proposal for which the retirement community came out in force. It was an almost frightening experience. The first day of the hearing they filled the room so full that we had to close the meeting down. Actually, when I came into the meeting, people from Covered Bridge were sitting in our seat on the dais. So we cancelled the meeting. That proposal turned into a year of hearings. It was an interesting experience, because that is political. When you get hundreds of people excited about something, it is going to be primarily a legal issue whether they should get this or not, but it is not purely legal. It can't be. So you see democracy at work when people show up. Finally, after about a year, one of the members of the Township Committee died unexpectedly and they asked me to fill that seat. And it was very strange. I said, "Why I would want to do that?" But I thought about it some more and I decided it might be interesting. That was in April. I had to run in September to fill out the last year of that job. And then I ran again the next year and won. It turned out to be about five years. I ended being Mayor my last year, which was fascinating. I am really glad I did it, because it was an experience  to serve, particularly as the mayor. There is a lot happening. You learn a lot about what is going on in town. To me it was service. I mean, they don't pay you much. They pay you $5,000 or something. But it is not about money. What was unusual about it was I didn't have to work very hard for it. I mean, some people come and say, "Boy, I really want to get that office and I'll raise money and campaign and go door to door."  I was appointed by what was then a popular committee, so getting elected wasn't a problem.  I was in the right party. In my fifth year, there was a shift and they started to elect the other party. And in my last year serving as mayor, we had a split committee, with two Democrats and two Republicans. I thought it became much more political. Instead of just thinking about what is the right way to handle some issue you ended up thinking about what the other party was going to do, and that makes it harder and much less pleasant. So when I lost last year, it was enough. Serving on a local township committee is a great experience, except that the town has grown. I think when I moved in there were probably 8,000 people in the town. Now there are 35,000. People who no longer know their town are living in town. You can't blame them because they commute. They spend at least four hours a day on buses and trains. They come home tired. They are not interested in going to town meetings. They barely get themselves going for the sports stuff for their kids. So they are not interested in government locally. In the election that I lost last year, less than 25% of the people voted. That is disappointing because you end up thinking that no one cares. It is not whether you get elected or not. It is that people did not care enough to vote, and that is disappointing. I think that is a trend in this suburban town. People think of their town as a place to sleep or something. They are very interested in the schools because their kids are in school, but very uninterested in what is going on locally.    Ms. Paul: Unless something happens that threatens them in some way, right?    Mr. Frenkiel: Yes, and that would usually be the schools. I guess two things happened in the schools while I was the mayor. First they had a grading policy debate, and then about possible overcrowding in the high schools. That got a lot of people upset. A lot of people felt that the township committee should take a proactive role, but I didn't. I felt that since the school boards are elected by the people, they should be allowed to manage their own business. And then, of course, the development of the town gets to be an issue. People see the farms disappearing and developments coming in and they don't like that. We always say that each person who moves into Manalapan wants to pull up the bridge after they move in. They want to be the last.    Ms. Paul: Does Manalapan have an active Green Acres Program? That seems to be a trend to try to save some of the open land.    Mr. Frenkiel: We worked extremely hard on that the last year I was in office. That was what I wanted to do if I had stayed in office. We developed a major plan about what was left, how much we could save, saving farms, creating parks and greenways, and what to do with the wetlands. We came up with an extensive proposal and put a two cent tax on the ballot for that and people passed it. But they didn't elect us. So far this year, it has been six months now that I have been out. I don't think they have done anything. They are not collecting the tax that we passed and the new people in office are much more concerned about tax reduction than about saving land, in my view. So I am not holding my breath. But that goes beyond politics. There is not much land left.    Ms. Paul: So where are you going to live in retirement?    Mr. Frenkiel: Here in Manalapan. We bought a beach house on Long Beach Island, and that is a nice combination. It is about an hour-and-a-half to the beach. I think that is a very nice way to retire, where you have two places. When you are home a lot, you get tired of any place. It doesn't matter how luxurious it is. It is just nice when we get cabin fever to go to a different place for a few days. But we love the beach, and we love Long Beach Island. We have been vacationing there for twenty-five years. So finally three years ago we bought a place. When you retire, you can really appreciate a place like that. When I was working I would not have bought it. It is too hard when you are working five days a week to enjoy it: those days, you spent your weekends catching up on the things you didn't do, and so I think two houses would be a chore until you retire.        Maizie and Dick Frenkiel  Ms. Paul: Your wife Maizie retired from her job as the school librarian?    Mr. Frenkiel: Yes, it has been really nice. Our beach house has turned out to be a winter house as much as a summer house for us. It is a great thing to do in the middle of winter. We spent Christmas week there last year.    Ms. Paul: Are there any other organizations or activities that you have been involved in that have meant a lot to you? I know Maizie is very active in the American Association of University Women.    Mr. Frenkiel: Yes, she has been the family volunteer. In the thirty years that we lived here and I was working, I was really only interested in work. I mean, except for going on vacation once in a while. I loved my work, so I didn't pay too much attention to the town and she always volunteered. She was a part of the Soccer Club, the Literacy Program, the AAUW, the Historical Society, and she was a part-time teacher. She grew up in a small town, so she had this sense of belonging, or wanting to belong in the town. I grew up in New York, and I couldn't imagine really being involved in politics, because in New York it is a big deal. So I think it was Maizie as much as anything that got me to join when I finally went on the Zoning Board and Township Committee. I felt like she had been volunteering all those years, and it turned out to be worthwhile personally for me to do it. I didn't feel like anybody owed me anything for it, but I probably wouldn't have gotten involved if she were not. In fact, people wouldn't have known me if she were not involved.    Ms. Paul: Tell me about your trip to the White House.    Mr. Frenkiel: Well, first we had a whole set up, and it was a big deal. They make you tell them who might be coming from your whole party, and they have to check it off to make sure there are no terrorists or something. The whole thing was set up, and then the President was called away. I think that was when he went to Israel on one of his peace missions. So we canceled. We set it up again two months later.    Ms. Paul: And when was this?    Mr. Frenkiel: 1995, I think. It was quite a nice affair. It made you feel good. We went to this old auditorium on the mall in Washington. It was presided over by the Vice- President. The President was in a meeting with someone else. We went up and got all the awards.    Ms. Paul: How many people got presidential awards then?    Mr. Frenkiel: Ten or twelve maybe. They were split between science and engineering, and maybe half a dozen of each. What was really neat was when, after the ceremony, they took us to the White House and we went to the Oval Office and we met the President, shook hands, and took pictures. Being in the Oval Office is quite neat. I remember he had this big old desk sitting in front of the windows of the Oval Office. It is not a really nice desk. It is just a big, old, wooden desk. It must have some personal significance.  I was standing next to it when they were setting up to take pictures, and I noticed laying on his desk in the pile to be read was a report on a book called The Bell Curve.  It was a very political thing at the moment. And he had this position paper that he must have been reading when we came in. But it was funny to see working materials on the President's desk. It was quite a mess, too. The desktop was messy, but he had this big pile of documents on the floor, and just a mess of paperwork, like everyone else has. But the whole thing was nice. They had a big banquet at a place called The Museum of Buildings. I don't know what it is. We went into this thing. It is very old and we were in a very large hall. If I remember, the whole building was a very large hall. All open, open quite high, and I could see that the walls of the room were different styles. So I thought maybe they had put together this room out of different architectural styles. But other than that I have no idea as to what the exhibit was.    Ms. Paul: Yes, I think there are models of things there. Well, thank you very much for doing this.    Mr. Frenkiel: You're welcome. We finally got here. What has it been, a year? Six months at least.    Ms. Paul: We finally got to do it, but thanks a lot Dick.    Mr. Frenkiel: You're welcome.     
MonmouthCounty;Renee Swartz;1935;2000;Renee Swartz, 1935, 2000        Remembering The 20th Century: An Oral History of Monmouth County      Chairwoman of Monmouth County Library Commission, Renee Swartz (right) with John Livingstone (center) and county Freeholder Theodore Narozanick, 1989  Date of Interview: July 11, 2000  Name of Interviewer: Alison Lenox  Premises of Interview: Ms. Swartz' home, Rumson, NJ  Birthdate of subject:  1935    Ms. Lenox: Thank you so much for meeting with me.    Mrs. Swartz: It's a pleasure, Alison, and I am very interested in this project. I think looking at people's lives is one of the most interesting ways of looking back historically on how we arrive at where we are today. And that makes history so meaningful here in Monmouth County. I am very pleased to be asked to contribute to this process. I am delighted to have you come here. With your expertise, maybe we will have an interesting tale.    Ms. Lenox: Oh, absolutely! I don't think it is expertise that is needed, because I think you can talk for many hours about all your accomplishments. It is going to be fascinating!    Mrs. Swartz: Well, I don't know where you would like to begin. I think we need to begin with a direction.    Ms. Lenox: Let's begin at the beginning. Were you born in this area?    Mrs. Swartz: I was born in Newark. My father was a physician  his name was Sidney David Becker. He began a practice in Keyport, probably  in the early 1930s. I was born in 1935, and it was during the Depression times. Of course I don't remember all of the trials and tribulations of that era, except that my father was a doctor  he was paid in kind.  Most of the area between Keyport and Red Bank was farmland. I guess it was called Middletown because it was just in the middle or between those two towns.  But anyway, this was mostly a truck farming area. Most of the farms grew peaches, apples, corn, and tomatoes…the things that we associate with truck farming in New Jersey. When holidays came, and these people were really too poor to pay their bills with cash, they used to bring in bushels of potatoes and tomatoes. In the wintertime, there would be handmade dolls and baked goods, and that is the way they paid for their services. It was really not too long ago. It wasn't really horse and buggy physician-patient relations, but it was close to that. And it was a very different time in medicine than we have today. Families grew up, and many of my father's patients were from large Italian families. My father would know the mama right down to the new baby, and he would be involved in doctoring two or three generations of the same family. It was a very interesting time to compare with what we have in the County now.     I went to school at Keyport High School, and in those days I think only two or three out of a class of maybe fifty to seventy students ever went to college. There was no pressure to do that. In the spring and fall, most of the class was out farming and helping their families. I can remember my father being very involved in the life of these people, and we were, too. You just naturally were very close  he was a very dedicated physician. From this area, he went on to the Perth Amboy Hospital. Riverview, in those days, was very, very small.    Ms. Lenox: Where was Riverview?    Mrs. Swartz: Riverview was exactly where it is now, except it was a tiny building. I can't really give you statistics or facts of the size or the number of physicians it had. But being in Keyport, my father went to Perth Amboy, which was a very large hospital. So most of his connections were not in Monmouth County. Perth Amboy is where most of the large, center area was for him, as he was in the northern part of the County. He became very active in politics, within the medical profession, and he went on to be the President of the Middlesex County Medical Society. Then he was a founder of the New Jersey chapter of The Academy of General Practice, which was an organization of general practitioners.  I think he was the first president of that organization in New Jersey.     During the summer, we would go to Asbury Park. We went to The Marine Grille, a restaurant that was at the very end of the boardwalk. Of course the Berkeley Carteret was there, also. In the summertime, after a very hot day, everyone went to the boardwalk in the evening, if they could, to "get the air!" All the women wore hats and gloves, and it was a very formal "airing." Today whatever you wear is fine, but in those days, there was an etiquette and a prescribed code, the women wearing their lovely dresses, hats, and gloves, and that was considered proper attire for an outing to the Asbury Park boardwalk. The Marine Grille was one of those lovely restaurants, which has long since gone, so life then was at a different pace than we have today.    The Parkway was just beginning in the early 1950s. We would take a drive down Highway 35, and because of the opening of the Parkway, people from cities close by would be coming to the shore. And that is the way the character of the County began to change. People who were in the cities found it much easier to come into the county with the Parkway, and large developments began to be built, one of the first called Fleetwood Park, on Highway 35. We used to go and look at the model homes.  I can remember my father looking at the construction, from an older person's point of view, knocking on the walls, and saying, "They'll never sell." They just were not put up the way the old-fashioned houses were. (Laughter) This was how clairvoyant he was! Ten thousand houses later, he was proven to be wrong. And that's how the character of the whole County changed. First it was the Parkway, and then gradually the farmers sold off their land.  People would come into my father's office, and he would have conversations with them. And these people just were not accustomed to having money like this, because they had just sold their farms. They got so much money from the sale of their land, and some of them had vests that they would put their money in. They would come in with all their money in their vest!    Ms. Lenox: You're kidding! Well to them, it must have been a lot of money.    Mrs. Swartz: It was a fortune! Some of the farmers are still there, but of course it's a different era. But that was the way it was. Most of the people that I knew, my generation, farmed in the spring and fall. A lot of them did graduate from high school, but a lot of them did not.    Ms. Lenox: Are you saying that in that time period people weren't really pressured  to go to college because they were farmers? And it was across the board, both boys and girls?    Mrs. Swartz: In my graduating class, maybe ten percent went to college, maybe less. The few people who I knew who went to college were not the majority of the class. Maybe there were sixty to eighty students, but there wasn't a push for college. There were no college courses in my school in my educational curriculum. There was one curriculum. There was typing, and there were a few vocational courses. You had business courses. Today there is such a pressure for everyone to go to college, that maybe we will end up in a society with jobs that will never be filled by people that would be perfectly happy to have them. These are jobs like a stationary engineer, or someone who does janitorial or plumbing work, or someone who works in a restaurant. These are vocations that are very much a part of our society, and they are becoming so hard to fill. And that's why I think the immigrant population is coming in so rapidly, because many Americans don't want to do all these jobs. And I suppose it is going to add to the vibrancy of our country by having the immigrant population renew the energy of the country. There should be more emphasis on vocational and artistic training. Not everyone has to be a physician or a lawyer. In those days, it was different. The pressure was the farm, and people were needed to work on the farms, and that was the way life was. And there was a business track also, and this was very good, too, to start your own business, your restaurant, or your little store. There were people who went into stationery stores and did very well. There were office suppliers, restaurant equipment work, and lots of things that people could do. But from my personal point of view, I would say maybe one percent  went away to college.    Ms. Lenox: And what were you, as a girl, expected to do?    Mrs. Swartz: I was in a different environment because my father was a physician and my mother was educated and had gone to college. And so there was no question for me. I, being the oldest child, was very encouraged and expected by my parents to do what I wanted to do. And college was certainly something that I wanted to do, and if it led to any other involvement, that was fine. There wasn't the pressure to be something or to do something, but to be an educated woman.    Ms. Lenox: So you could make the decision yourself about what you wanted to do.    Mrs. Swartz:  In fact, I was married the summer of my junior year in college. My husband is a physician, and he was going to Jefferson Medical School in Philadelphia when we met. I was going to Barnard College, which is the women's college of Columbia University, and so there was a little decision there. I had to decide if I was going to continue at Barnard, which was in New York, or was I going to move with him to Philadelphia. I can remember my husband saying I really didn't have to finish school since there wasn't any pressure to do so. And I can remember my parents saying I should finish school, especially since they were paying for it. And to answer your question about what was expected of me, they definitely would have been disappointed if I hadn't finished, and I would have too. So I took the train to Philadelphia, stayed three days, went to Bryn Mawr College for six months, and then I took the train to New York in six months so I could graduate from Barnard College.     Ms. Lenox: Good for you.    Mrs. Swartz: I was really set on finishing my education. There was no way that I was going to give it up, which I am pleased about.  I used to take the train on Monday, and I would have a wonderful time because I used to know all the porters. I would immediately go into the dining car and have breakfast, and it was like traveling. And I would stay in New York until Thursday when I would take the train back. I  lived in the dorms and finished my credits. And it was fun.    Ms. Lenox: It happens now so much more frequently, but back then I am sure it didn't happen a lot.    Mrs. Swartz: It was very odd, like I was this anomaly. First of all, there was the pressure to finish. I had gotten married, and in those days, that was your objective. (Laughter) So then I did this, and they couldn't understand it. I was young, and I was a few years ahead of myself. I went in to see the President  because I was peculiar. They couldn't understand why I wouldn't stay at Bryn Mawr, or why I was leaving to come back to Barnard    Ms. Lenox: So you talked to the President of Bryn Mawr?    Mrs. Swartz: Yes, and her name was Helen Taft Manning. She was the sister of President Taft. She was pompous and a very official looking woman, and there I was, just a young lady. She told me they couldn't understand it, and they would accept me to graduate and to do a Master's program, which was quite a big deal. And I thought about it, but when I graduated, I wouldn't get my degree. I would get a certificate instead, because there was a two-year residency requirement. So I would have had to be on the campus for two years. In all my wisdom, I decided I had to have my degree if I graduated. So I told her I couldn't do that, which was scandalous. So I went on this adventure back and forth, but I did get my degree from Barnard, and it was exactly what I wanted. In retrospect, I should have done it the other way because I would have ended up with a Master's Degree. Then I continued on at Columbia for a Master's, but it was too hard commuting. Then I became pregnant, and it just became too hard to do. I had seven years to finish the program, and seven years goes very fast when you have a child. Then my husband graduated from school and did his residency in New York at Cornell, and then we moved back to Monmouth County. He opened his office in Middletown, because he is from this area, too, and that's where he wanted to practice. He grew up in Monmouth Beach and Shrewsbury, and his parents had a business in Middletown. He loved the shore area, and he just couldn't think of any other place where he wanted to live. So we came back to this area, and then it became even harder for me to go to New York. I used to go on the bus, because his practice was on Cherry Tree Farm Road in Middletown, just off Route 35, a bus route . That's where he opened his office. We bought a house there, and he had a home/office practice. The bus used to stop at six o'clock in the morning in front of the house, and I would get on and go to New York City to Teacher's College. I was taking a Master's in Educational Administration, and I would spend the day in New York doing this. Well, you can't do that for very long, so the seven years passed, and I had sixteen credits. Then I had another child, and it just became impossible. Actually, sometimes when you have it all laid out for you in an easy way, you don't understand it!    Ms. Lenox: You don't see it, you don't look ahead.    Mrs. Swartz: Yes, that is so true.    Ms. Lenox: I would like to talk about Asbury Park a little bit more. What it was like then and how you think it has changed and why? If I'm not mistaken, it was "the" place to go, is that right?    Mrs. Swartz: I was born in 1935, so you are talking about 1945 to 1950. I was out of the area through the 1950s. I think Asbury Park was never in the category of Atlantic City, because Atlantic City in those days was very elegant with all those lovely hotels. It was a premier resort. Asbury Park was not of that caliber, but it was one of the fine places on the shore. It was a destination for the summer. The whole shore area, and you can pick out a few of these most popular places, was really a destination for people in the cities. Asbury Park was one of the lovely areas, and the boardwalk was beautiful. I remember going to The Berkeley Carteret with my husband on New Year's Eve. We went there for a party, and it was so elegant. They had a wonderful trio that played for dancing. It was lovely, and the boardwalk had the peanut man and all the rides. It was something that children looked forward to. I can remember when my daughter had her tenth birthday, I took six or seven of her best friends there, and we had a party. We all took picnic lunches, and the kids went on all the rides. She is forty years old now, so we are talking thirty years ago. But it changed because I guess demographics changed. People had money and they stopped coming to the Jersey shore. They started traveling for their vacation. Instead of going to the shore and renting a house, they traveled somewhere else. And now it has come back.  In one hundred years, it's almost like it was then, but on a different level. There is a different sophistication, population, involvement, and interest, but it has come back to such a degree. Not Asbury, but the Jersey shore in different ways. The beaches were beautiful, and then we had tremendous erosion and storms. People had a great deal of expendable income, so it wasn't fashionable just to go to Asbury Park for the summer. You started going to Bermuda, or the Islands, or you took a trip across the country, or to Disney World. There were all these different places, which people are still doing, but now they have come to appreciate the fact that this Jersey Shore is so lovely. And the beaches have been restored. Now I can't tell you what happened to Asbury, because everybody else knows what happened. And Long Branch was the same. Places like Spring Lake and Sea Girt, they did not go through that upheaval because I don't think they were so public. They were mostly private. I think a lot depended on tourists, and on the tourists driving the whole economy. When people had money, they went traveling, or gambling, or on bus trips, or down to Nashville. It just became so easy to travel with flying, and people became curious about doing other things. To do exactly what your family did before was maybe not the thing to do. You did other things. So I don't really know what happened, other than demographic changes, population changes, economic reasons, maybe the erosion of the shore, maybe the pollution of the ocean. Years ago, who thought about it? The ocean was the ocean. But  we let it get to the point where it was not even bearable. And it has taken all these years to bring the ocean back, to bring the sand back, and to bring back the idea of the Jersey shore as it used to be. And I think that is what has changed.    Ms. Lenox: The Parkway was not around when you first got here, obviously. Do you remember exactly when it started happening?    Mrs. Swartz: Well, I was growing up, so I would think that it began in the 1940s. I would think that after the War.    Ms. Lenox: I think when major highways come into a community, it changes the community so much.    Mrs. Swartz: Monmouth County was a distance from the city, from North Jersey. I remember when we would leave in the evening to take a drive when my father was finished working or on a Saturday, we would drive to Asbury. It might have taken forty minutes or  maybe an hour, because you went on all the small roads. But then as the different roads came through, it was quicker. Imagine coming from the city. But with the Parkway, it was a direct connection. And so it made a big difference. I don't know when the Turnpike was built, but it was the same thing. I think it was probably after the War. It, too, began to change the face of the county with increased population, building, construction, services, and even the expertise. People came here and could start businesses. We did lose our farms, but we had people coming in with skills that enriched the life of the County. Then we had more families, and then we needed more schools. And that's how I got involved with the library, because there was no facility to accommodate the population explosion and the kind of degree of education that I had wanted for my children.    Ms. Lenox:. So let's go back to where you met your husband, and how you got started.     Mrs. Swartz: We were introduced because his family knew my family.  It was very traditional. He had already finished his first year in medical school. As my father was a physician, we were introduced. He was going into his sophomore year in medical school, and I was going into my sophomore year in college. We dated that year, and then that summer we were married. He was then going into his junior year in medical school, and I was going into my senior year in college. And so we were married. He grew up in the county. Well, he grew up in the county, and his story is very interesting. He is third generation Monmouth County. His grandfather and his grandfather's brother came together to Ellis Island from White Russia, which is Lithuania.  When they came through Ellis Island, they had to give their names and data, etc. The two brothers somehow were taken by different people, so one brother's name is Schwarz. It's spelled like the car dealer in Red Bank, and that is a branch of the family, but they spelled it with the "sch." When my husband's grandfather came through, they spelled it Swartz. So even though it's the same family, there are two different spellings.  The brother who was in Red Bank was Lou Schwarz. He started with a little horse and buggy, and he had notions and things. He would go around and sell them, and that is the way he started. Incidentally, the two brothers came through at the same time as the grandfather of Michael Eisner, who is now the CEO of Walt Disney. He had a little horse and buggy too, but he was selling millinery and notions. That's how he started  the whole Galleria in Red Bank was once the Eisner factory. In World War I, Eisner made a fortune making uniforms for the soldiers. So the one brother had this little horse and buggy, and he went around selling household things, notions, or knickknacks. And then from that came a little antique store in Red Bank. And then, about the time that Eisner went on to his factory, my husband's grandfather went to Highlands. Highlands in those days was a kind of  fishing town and shore resort. All the ferries came there from New York at the turn of that century, because it was in the late 1800s. We have tried to pin it down, but it was probably 1860, 1870, or 1880. The ferries were coming to bring people from New York. So he went to Highlands and started a little store that sold souvenirs for the tourists, notions, and he also had a soda fountain. It was like a little variety store. One of the people who came over the summer was a young lady , and they eventually were married. Then they  lived in Highlands. My husband's name is Harry, and his grandfather's name was also Harry. Gradually Harry Swartz bought  a lot of the property in Highlands, so he became the big landowner in Highlands. He had stores on three corners: one was an A&P, one was a diner, and one was his store. The tourists would come in the summer for fishing and clamming equipment, etc. My husband's father was born in the area, and he eventually was involved with real estate and had a furniture store in Middletown. My husband was brought up in Middletown, and he lived on Tindall Road , but where he lived is no longer there. He went to Leonardo School, and there was no Middletown High School at that time. It was just Leonardo Grammar School, which is now an intermediate school. He said that he was the first one  who ever went on to become a doctor from that little school. He was born in 1931. So my husband is third generation, and our children are fourth generation Monmouth County residents. We have a son who is a physician practicing with my husband, and he has a son. So our grandchildren who live here are fifth generation Monmouth County residents. We are very proud of that.    Ms. Lenox: Absolutely, that's fantastic.    Mrs. Swartz: We have been involved in the history of Monmouth County for a very long time.    Ms. Lenox: You got married and settled in a house, which is also an office.    Mrs. Swartz: After my husband did his internship in the city, he decided he was going to practice in Middletown. The house/office was on Cherry Tree Farm Road  the office was downstairs, and we lived upstairs. We lived there about seven years. He was trained to be an internist, but he decided he liked every part of medicine: he wanted to deliver babies and be involved as a family doctor, so he did an extra year of training. He was beginning his very busy practice of delivering babies and being involved in the community, and he became the doctor for the towns around Middletown. He has been in practice for forty-two years, which is a long time. The years really add up, and we have been very sedentary. We have lived here in Rumson and have not moved in ten years.    Ms. Lenox: What made you come back to this area?     Mrs. Swartz: My husband wanted to be in Middletown. He loved to sail and fish, and we had friends here. The school system in Rumson was very good. I particularly liked the community, and we had looked in a lot in different areas. We actually looked on Navesink River Road, which is in Middletown. But the houses were very, very large old houses. We decided that Rumson seemed to offer the kind of life that we liked. And we have been very happy here  it has worked out beautifully. My children really thrived, and the school system was wonderful. Our daughter went through the whole school system, and our oldest boy went through the system until ninth grade. Then he went to Choate, which is a boarding school in Connecticut. Our youngest boy went to Rumson Country Day, and then he went off to Choate. But our daughter took advantage of the whole school system, and she was very happy and is still connected to friends in the area and comes back to visit. One son is a physician and stayed in Monmouth County, and the other two do not live in the area. But they do come back and maintain connections.    Ms. Lenox: Has Rumson changed much within the timeframe that you have been here?    Mrs. Swartz: I think Rumson has always had the same character. When we bought this piece of property, it was part of a very large estate. It had been bought by someone before us. It had been the Shiff Estate. Shiff was of the caliber of a Carnegie. Shiff was one of the prominent financiers of the century, and his estate encompassed I don't know how many acres. We have about four acres here, and when we bought this, it was part of thirty-two acres.  The properties of all of the old estates have been pretty much divided, and the zoning here in different areas is different, so that some parcels are smaller than others. But I think that is what has really changed. At the turn of the century there were these huge estates of multimillionaires, financiers, and that environment went all through Monmouth Beach. There were the large homes in Monmouth Beach, too. In fact my husband's family had a summer house in Monmouth Beach. But when they lived there, there were houses on the other side of the seawall. The beach was so wide, and the seawall was there, and then you had Ocean Avenue. There were homes on the other side of the seawall, before all the erosion. So that was the character of the area: it was really like a play area for very well-to-do people. And then you had Asbury Park with all the rides, and the entertainment, which was for everyone. But that's the way it was, depending on your area.    Ms. Lenox: I love this area.    Mrs. Swartz: So we loved it, and we decided it was where we wanted to be. We thought the school system was excellent, and it worked out that way. And it became a very lovely life for us, and my husband is still in Middletown and still practices exactly where he opened his office.    Ms. Lenox: That's unique.    Mrs. Swartz: And our son is with him, and they do this together. But as we approach this century, it is much different. Everything has changed. The way Rumson has changed has been the dividing of the large estates, but the character of the town has been maintained. I think it is governed well, and people are very conscious of maintaining a certain standard of service and education. There has been a great stability here. But it does change, and you look around and see the old houses being demolished. Depending on the economics, there are huge houses being erected or renovated.     Ms. Lenox: But it is nice to know  what the character is aesthetically.    Mrs. Swartz: I think the character of the town has been carefully maintained. I think there has been a blending. There have been new people moving in and new energy. Our children are long since gone like the children of other parents our age, and so many people sold their homes and moved away or retired. And then younger people have come in with children, and now they are expanding the school. There is great resistance to that, as there is in every community, because of the taxes. And for many years, there were a lot of older people that predominated and didn't want an increase in the school system because they didn't need it. They didn't want to pay for it, but they were still part of the community. But this has changed now. These older people have sold their homes because of economics, health or age, and it's a new generation living here. And I think it's very interesting. New life comes in, but as you look around, Rumson is still maintained well and beautifully, but it is different. Nothing stays the same.    Ms. Lenox: I want to start talking about how you have established your profession and how you define yourself. What did you do after you graduated from Barnard?    Mrs. Swartz: I think it was different then. I think back then education was not really a driving force. It was very nice, but you had to be very committed. And maybe that is scandalous to say, but I do think that it was on the cusp of women pushing forward. Of course Barnard has always been a women's college. It always encouraged women to succeed, excel, and try to reach their potential. If you weren't really interested in that, you wouldn't be drawn to that kind of a college. There were many other ways you could go to college and get your degree, and still have a different perspective. But I was oriented toward achievement, really, and pushing yourself into a career. I think even today, more women who graduate from Barnard go on to get their Ph.D and become professional women than women from any other school. That even includes schools like Stanford, Cornell, UCLA. The women's colleges were maybe always that way. But Barnard was really attuned to excellence. Not that I was definitely that way, because I don't even know why I was drawn to that school. I did like Bryn Mawr, and I think I was the only person ever from Keyport High School who ever aspired to any kind of a college at that time.     When I was married and  began to have children, my husband was very busy, and I did have childcare. I was able to do a lot of what I wanted. I had to be there for my children, and I was very interested in that, but I also had a lot of free time because my husband was very busy. He was in a profession, and not even in a specialty in that profession, but he was involved in an all-consuming passion. He really loves what he does, and he wasn't a nine-to-five person. So there were many evenings we didn't have a traditional dinner hour, and we didn't have the traditional time that father came home like most families did, and they would all sit around the dinner table and discuss their day. Or maybe that's not even the norm, maybe that's a Norman Rockwell image that nobody really has. So I had a lot of time to figure out, which I really didn't do consciously, what interesting things I wanted to do. In those days, volunteerism and community interests were…well I can't say more important than today, because now women have careers, pressures, families, and so much to do. And I don't know how they accomplish it all  it's a miracle that they are even able to do half what they do. I think women have been sold a bill of goods that they are supposed to be able to do everything, and they try to do too much. But in those days, I had the luxury of being able to do community and volunteer work. I could have gone back and gotten my degree at that time, even though I had little children, but it was a little too hard for me. And I didn't want to go to school locally because in my mind I had to go back to where I started. And that might have been an interesting thing to do, too. I was involved in the Barnard Club. They formed a Barnard Club in I guess the early 1960s, and I was invited to come. I did, and I found it fascinating. There were women from every decade, and there was a woman from Red Bank whose name was Irma Von Glan. She was a maiden lady, and she taught Latin, and she had taught  my husband in school. I sat next to her, and I was probably in my early twenties, and this lady was "ancient" as far as I was concerned. They had just shot the Mercury Space Launch, or one of the first space launches, and Armstrong was coming down. Wasn't that the Mercury?    Ms. Lenox: Where he just went up in space? Right.    Mrs. Swartz: The ship that they were going to pick him up on was called the Corsage. I was sitting next to this lady, and I don't know how old she was. And she said to me, "Dearie, I remember the first Corsage. This battleship wasn't the first one. And that was the Spanish American War." And when she said that to me, I thought I would never hear this type of thing any place else.     Ms. Lenox: How did you decide to become a volunteer and become part of the community?    Mrs. Swartz: Well, it wasn't that I decided, it was just the avenue that was open. I wasn't going to have a career per se, because I really didn't have any idea of what I would do. I had young children, and our son was probably four or five years old, and the second child was probably born by that time. Or maybe we had all three children by that time. In those days, your pressure wasn't career. When you were home, you were a stay-at-home mom, as they call it today. Even though I did have help that could relieve me, pretty much that was what you did unless you had great pressure and training to become a career-oriented person. And I didn't. So being at home and very interested in my children and their educational progress and growth, the avenue to doing something outside of the home was in the volunteer capacity. Without much thinking about it, I got into that track. So I did go to this Barnard Club, and I did meet very interesting women.    Ms. Lenox: Was this located in New York?    Mrs. Swartz: No, it is in Monmouth County. Some of the older ladies who had been here for years decided it would be nice to have a local Barnard Club, because there are college clubs all over the country and all over the world. So the meetings were very lovely and socially done well with grace and charm in someone's lovely home. I was young and very impressed with these very interesting women who were educated, well-read, and people I normally didn't come across. I was a young mother, and to me these were very interesting women. At that time The AAUW (American Association of University Women) was doing a study of the educational facilities in the County and conducting a survey. This was in the early 1960s and the population was beginning to change. The Parkway was already having an impact, already the County face was changing, the fabric of life was changing. There were these hundreds of homes around, and young populations in all the areas where there hadn't been this population before. The population was growing by tremendous amounts, beyond anyone's expectations. Monmouth County was being discovered for the seashore and all its other different attributes. So the AAUW decided they were going to see what was available educationally. It was during the Johnson era, and Johnson as President had all this initiative for Head Start and monies to come in for Title 2 to improve education and schools. This was because of this change after the War and the way the country had come out of the War. And it was a new time. Thinking that this money would be available, you had to plan what you would do with it. AAUW thought about this ahead of time.  They wrote letters to different organizations, and I don't know how many were approached. But there were an awful lot of university women, different college clubs, church groups, and you name it. And the Barnard Club got one of these letters. They said they would like to have a volunteer, and wondered if anyone was interested in serving on this committee to proceed with whatever study they were doing about educational resources in the County. And so I volunteered. Well, nobody else was going to volunteer, and there wasn't any competition, so I was it. I went and joined this committee, and I found it fascinating. I got involved with these women who were professionally oriented, or they seemed to know what they were doing, but they were volunteers also. I got involved in this, and the results of the study showed that education definitely needed to be encouraged, it needed money and support. But the backbone, which was the libraries, was very inferior. They would need a great deal of effort, industry, resources, attention, and whatever you want to call it.  The Monmouth County Library was in existence, but in 1961 it was really just a little house in Freehold that had a collection, and it had mostly bookmobile stops. The bookmobile went around the County, and the librarians changed the collection in schools twice a year. The County Library was a resource for the schools and the bookmobiles also came into some member communities to change their collections. The County Library was begun in 1922. It was to bring library services to the rural areas and also to serve communities that wanted to support it. There were lots of communities that wanted to support the County system, but there were some that didn't. You wouldn't call them cities, but maybe you would call them urban centers. They felt they had their own libraries and didn't need this rural delivery service. Places like Middletown, Red Bank, Long Branch, Asbury Park, and Neptune felt they didn't  need to be part of this system. So you had areas that were kind of exempt from the system and didn't pay taxes or anything for the libraries, and then you had towns that felt they could enjoy having the extra benefit of belonging to a larger library system. Those towns were called the members, and included Rumson, Fair Haven, Little Silver, Hazlet, and a number of other towns. And the rest were bookmobile stops. There were no branch libraries like Hazlet, Holmdel, Colts Neck, or Marlboro. Places like that were only bookmobile stops. The AAUW study proved that this was a  problem. We had a resource, we had a network, we had a structure, but we had nothing else. With that conclusion, the study ended. It was then decided by some of us that maybe we should form a Friends of the Monmouth County Library System, and we should try to seek monies and resources to bolster this system. After all, Monmouth County was going to have all these children coming in, and if students had to do a project, they had to go either to Rutgers or Princeton. There was no resource library in this county. So it was very interesting. We began this organization, and we went out and spoke everywhere. We spoke to church groups, the Elks, at the train stations, and everywhere to enlist the support from the Board of Freeholders to build a new library and get monies from Title 2. Libraries traditionally get the least amount, or the last of the monies after everything else. But our campaign was very successful. Joe Irwin was the Chairman of the Board of Freeholders then, and I remember going to see him. We didn't want the library built in Freehold, where the collection was housed, because the study showed that the population would have the most growth in the area around Shrewsbury first. Furthermore, the Borough of Freehold was not a member of the system either  it was one of these exempt areas. The study showed that the center of population was going to be in the eastern part of the county. Now it is in the western part, but demographics indicated that by the 1980s, it was going to be in the Shrewsbury area. So we wanted a library built there first. I remember Joe calling me in. He told me that there was a position on the Board of the Monmouth County Library. This is a Freeholder appointment for five years. As I had been  so active with the Friends that he invited me to consider this appointment. There was an editorial in the Register that said I should get that position. I had no campaign, no political base or anything like that, but I was very active, and I was responsible for having the decision made by the Board of Chosen Freeholders to build two libraries. I was President of the Friends, and I was their driving force to become a public force and to go out and seek funds to support and bolster this library system. I had young children, and I was very interested in education, and very driven to make sure that my children would have the best that life could offer. If they were going to go through a public system, I wanted to see if we could get it enhanced. I then went to see the Director of the Board of Freeholders, and he told me they were going to make the decision about  two libraries. Then someone resigned from the Monmouth County Library Commission, which is the advisory body for the Monmouth County Library.  It had five members, although currently  it has seven members. When the position came available, there was a great swell of public support and an even an editorial in the paper that said I should get this position because I had done so much to advance the interest of the library. And I did. I was appointed to this unexpired term in 1968.      Monmouth County Library Commission, 2001. Seated from left: Secretary Frank Gibson, Chairwoman Renee Swartz, Treasurer Frank Walsh. Standing from left: director Kenneth Sheinbaum, library commissioners Barbara Silkworth and Grace Abromov, and assistant library director Margaret Field.  Ms. Lenox: Were there any other women on the Library Commission?    Mrs. Swartz: No. In 1968, it was a whole different thing for women to serve in this way.    Ms. Lenox: So the first woman on the board was you.    Mrs. Swartz: Right, and for many years I was the only one. Then it became not fashionable for there to be only one only woman, and another woman was appointed. But it has been a mostly  male-oriented board, as most boards are. I have been on the board since1968 and I have been chairman since 1976. Since that time, we have built the twelve branches. Many bookmobile stops became branches. So we have had a tremendous surge of  building.    Ms. Lenox: Which were the first two?    Renee Swartz, president of the Association of New Jersey Library Commissioners at Eastern Branch, 1973  Renee Swartz, president of the Association of New Jersey Library Commissioners at Eastern Branch, 1973  Mrs. Swartz: The first library to be built was the Eastern Branch on Route 35 in Shrewsbury.  This is the largest of all of our branches. That is almost like the jewel in our crown. It's one of the finest reference libraries in the state. There is nothing to compare to it. The other libraries, the members, are like town municipal libraries. We have Headquarters and eleven branches, which used to be bookmobile stops. In all we have seventeen member libraries and forty member municipalities in the entire system. The thirteen exempts that didn't want to be part of the system are still that way. When you are a resident of a member community, you pay a County tax which enables you to use all the libraries in Monmouth County Library System for free. If you live in any of the exempt towns, you have to pay fifty dollars to get a library card to borrow from the library. If you just use the facilities in the system, it's all free. So it went from the study of AAUW, to getting involved, to forming the Friends, to getting on the Board of the Monmouth County Library, and then from there we formed the first branch system in the state. Our system was so excellent, and we were so innovative, and we did so many things. The branch system became the model. Then we had free concerts, and they became a model. We also have materials in Spanish, Russian, Chinese, and other languages.    Ms. Lenox: And you have established that? You sat around and thought you needed to do this now, and then something else after that?    Mrs. Swartz: It kind of evolves. You have a director who is responsible for running the library and the personnel/staff and most of the programming. But every once in awhile, we get an idea, and we say we would like to try this or that. And through the years, this is how it has happened. Sometimes the director brings us an idea and we decide to go with it. Other times we are sitting around and someone has read about something that was done somewhere else, and we decide we would like to try it here. And then we will do a pilot project. For years we had History Week and Jazz Week, which we still have. We now are very interested in poetry, and we are interested in art. So it goes through different stages, and we continually try to make it more vibrant. But it also happens that we have staff people that we hope have ideas and are creative. We have the director and the senior administration, and we have things going on around the country. And we know we are the best library in the State of New Jersey. We hear this all the time. All this has propelled me on to national committees, and I was asked if I wanted to serve on the State Board which is a five-year appointment by the Governor. I think it was in the early 1980s that I was appointed to my first term. Now I have served through four governors, and I have been on the board since the 1980. I have been Chairman of the State Board since 1986. And I have tremendous interest on a state level, because that board is over all the libraries in the state. I have gotten involved with the School Media Association, the New Jersey Library Association. If I have an idea, I bring it up, and it somehow gets going. I go to different committees and I bring in ideas. You know, if you speak up and sound halfway intelligent, they ask you to do a job. And if you do that job well and bring some spirit and enthusiasm to it, the next thing you know you are in charge.  I have also been involved at Rutgers.    Ms. Lenox: That is where I went to school.    Mrs. Swartz: I like being involved there. I have been Chairman of the Board of Rutgers Library School probably for twenty years. All through the interim, I maintain my interest at Barnard. I was asked to be on different committees there, and I became President of the Barnard Club in Monmouth County. Then I was asked to come to the school because we ran very interesting functions and began to have different events with other college clubs. Then I became involved at Barnard College and for years served on different committees, and then I became the President of the Alumni Association at Barnard College. It is worldwide with maybe 30,000 alumnae. I traveled and had very interesting times all through the country.    Ms. Lenox: And all the while doing all the stuff at the library.    Mrs. Swartz: Right, at the same time. It was kind of like different stages and phases. Then they had a Library White House Conference in 1979. There never had been one on libraries before. The library profession wanted to discuss libraries, their impact, and their partnership with education. We give money to education, but not much to libraries. So how does that work out? So I became involved. I was elected to chair the delegation from New Jersey to Washington. There were sixteen people that went in 1979. It was by  formula  how many state senators and congressmen you had, so each state had the same representation at this national conference as you did in the government. They went through every group…ethnic, religious, social, and even the gray panthers. It was a formula where you had to have someone nominated. Out of all these nominations, there was a Governor's Conference, and it came down to sixteen people in the state. Those people represented the state, and they had been filtered through many different screenings to make sure you had all the people represented like the handicapped, the disadvantaged, the inner city, the well-to-do, etc. So I chaired that delegation in 1979, and then there was another White House Conference in 1991. And I was the only person in the country who came back to the 1991 White House Conference. I was a chairman of the delegation, and it was entirely different people with an entirely different perspective. So I have been in it a long time. And I have loved it. And it has all come together, though there was no conscious design. It was just an interest of mine, and I was vocal and visible. I got invited to different places to participate, and because I did, I have been involved in many interesting things with faculty such as designing curriculum at Rutgers, etc. I represent the lay public. I am not a librarian, I am not a professionally library-trained person, but I bring in the perspective of you and me as citizens. And from that point of view, I think of what would be the best thing to happen given our funding. I really epitomize the volunteer sector.    Ms. Lenox: And this is all volunteer, is that correct?    Mrs. Swartz: Absolutely! I have never been paid for anything. When I do attend a conference, I am reimbursed by the county or state, as any employee would be who was sent to a conference. But other than that, I do not get any compensation. I go the State Board meetings and I get travel expenses. I get nine dollars when I travel to a State Board meeting in Trenton. (Laughter) And that's not going to feed you very much. I have had much criticism all my life because all my work has been done on a volunteer basis. This criticism occurs especially as women have come into the mainstream and have had important positions. Obviously my work is all administration and planning and a process of visioning where you would like to see things happen and develop. But people are always saying I could have gotten paid so much money or been this or that, etc.  Other women would say I was just wasting my time and should be working out there and setting an example for others. I would feel bad when I got home, and I would think about all these women retiring and getting their teeth, their glasses, and their healthcare all paid for. And it would have been nice to have thought about that, but those things never entered my mind.    Ms. Lenox: It is interesting that someone said you should have set a great example, but you did set an incredible example for volunteerism! And it shows what you can accomplish by just being somebody who is interested. It's amazing!    Mrs. Swartz: It comes around now, when you look at society. You see how little time and energy there is, and what is left for people to do like what I have done.  In my traveling around the country and the state, it has been recognized that I kind of have a vision for what is the correct thing to do. And I am very pleased about that.    Ms. Lenox: And you have received accolades. You just got one last week when you went to Chicago.    Mrs. Swartz: And through the years I have been rewarded. I got the Columbia Medal for being an outstanding alumna. I am the only person in the state who received the Trustee of the Year award twice from the New Jersey Library Association. I received it in 1999, and I had received it in 1980.     Ms. Lenox: Yours has been and continues to be an extremely productive life, and I'd like to thank you again for sharing it with us.    
MonmouthCounty;Rainette Holimon;1926;2000;Rainette Holimon, 1926, 2000        Remembering The 20th Century: An Oral History of Monmouth County      Rainette Holimon  Date of Interview: May 17, 2000  Name of Interviewer: June West  Premises of Interview: Ms. Holimon's home, Neptune Township, NJ  Birthdate of Subject: April 3, 1926    Ms. Holimon: I was born in Asbury Park, New Jersey on April 3, 1926. I was born at home, 3 Charles Street, which is now in the area known as the Asbury Park Village. I am the youngest of six children. I was delivered without medical help. My mother delivered me herself. There were six children  three are still living - my oldest sister, Ruth Bannister Sampson, another sister Estelle Bannister Smallwood, and myself. There was one boy, John Bannister. He and my sister Dora and my sister Elizabeth are all deceased. I attended the local elementary school which at that time was Bangs Avenue South, a segregated school with the Black students attending the south side of the building. The White students attended the north side of the building. However, we did share the same toilet facilities. Use of these facilities was scheduled. In other words, the Blacks used it at one specified time, and the Whites used it at another specified time. All of our teachers of Bangs Avenue South were well educated Black teachers from all parts of the country. The education at that time was very, very good. The teachers were excellent. I believe they had a very strong influence on me because we were well taught. After graduating from elementary school, I attended the Asbury Park High School, which at that time was predominantly White. All of the teachers were White. It was quite a traumatic experience leaving the Bangs Avenue South School and being immediately thrown into the predominantly White environment of the Asbury Park High School. Quite a few of the students who graduated from Bangs Avenue South did not do well in this new environment, and many of them dropped out after maybe the first year. I remained at Asbury High and graduated from there in 1943. As a student in the grammar school, my grades were excellent. Going into the new environment, I think, affected me as it did other students, and my grades were just average with the exception of the business courses of typing and shorthand. World War II started in 1941, which was my year to graduate, and the government requested secretaries and typists to work at the local federal agency at Fort Monmouth. Eleven of us were tested in April and we were permitted to come out of school in April  we did not have to wait for the June graduation because seemingly they had an urgent need for clerical support. So we were tested, and out of eleven students I made the highest grades in the shorthand examination and the average grade in the typing exam. We were all released from school and hired at Fort Monmouth. I was hired as a secretary, but unfortunately, due to the noticeable racism at that time, I was never given this opportunity to perform as a secretary. I was given a typist position and over the years various clerical positions at Fort Monmouth. I never really utilized my skills to the highest mainly because they were not accepting me as a secretary at that time. Over the years I did move up to a couple of administrative positions, but nothing that was comparable to my skills and to my education. I remained employed at Fort Monmouth in various positions for twenty years, and in 1960, I decided to resign, and I enrolled in college, which at that time was Monmouth College.    Ms. West: Where was Fort Monmouth located?    Ms. Holimon: Well, it's right outside of Eatontown, but the mailing address is Fort Monmouth, New Jersey. It's one of the largest federal agencies in Monmouth County. I attended Monmouth College for one year full-time and then the following year I decided to go back to work.    Ms. West: What year was that?    Ms. Holimon: 1964. And while attending Monmouth College, I entered into a conversation with a young man who was in class with me by the name of Wilbert Russell  he is now the city manager in Asbury Park. At that time Mr. Russell was very active in the NAACP, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. At that time, this organization was very active in trying to get companies and organizations to employ more Blacks, more minorities. Mr. Russell told me that there was a company by the name of Bell Laboratories located in Holmdel, New Jersey, and he suggested that I go out there and file for employment as a secretary. At the time I scoffed at the idea, telling him that I didn't think that they would hire any Black people, but he told me to go, so I went. I went out and was tested, and within a few weeks was hired as a secretary. At the time I started working there, out of an employment force of over a thousand people, there might have been maybe six to ten Blacks. There was one Black secretary at the time. And when I came on board I was the second. But I was well received, and spent another twenty years with the Bell system.    Ms. West: What year did you start there?    Ms. Holimon: I started in 1964. After ten years with Bell Laboratories I got the urge to join the United States Peace Corps. I just felt that I wanted to do something more meaningful, even though I had a very good job at the time. In fact, by 1974, I was training secretaries and typists at Bell Laboratories. I asked the company to give me a leave of absence, an educational leave of absence, to join the Peace Corps, and this they did. And in August of 1974, I joined the United States Peace Corps.    Ms. West: You mentioned that you were working for Bell Labs, where is Bell Labs located?    Ms. Holimon: Bell Laboratories is located in Holmdel, New Jersey, I guess it's about fourteen miles from Asbury Park. I joined the Peace Corps in 1974 and was sent to Nairobi, Kenya, East Africa. My assignment at that time was to take over a project involving the setting up of a secretarial school for Kenyan woman. I was assigned principal of the school and also performed teaching duties. I was accompanied by a staff of four Americans, all of whom were White. The school was organized by the Kenya government. The Kenya government has an organization call the National Youth Service. This National Youth Service was established soon after Kenya received its independence. I believe it was established in 1963. The purpose of the Youth Service was to teach male and female young people, how to work in an environment where they were not under the jurisdiction of the colonialists, which they had been prior to their independence. It was to teach them all kinds of skills:  driving, agriculture, sewing and road building. The age range was from about sixteen to maybe twenty-three.    Ms. West: Was your life experience growing up here in Monmouth County one of the reasons you chose to join the Peace Corps, to go into that particular part of the world?    Ms. Holimon: Well, my life experiences did not push me towards Africa. When I applied, I asked for an African country. You don't necessarily get what you ask for. I did not ask for Nairobi, Kenya, I was just assigned to that particular country. I did have a memorable conversation with my mother, oh, many years prior to going into the Peace Corps, when she told me that her family, her father's people, had come from a country which is now Madagascar. At that time she said, "Papa's people came from Malagasy (now Madagascar)." But I didn't pay any attention to this remark. We weren't into searching for our roots at the time she told me this. But it just stayed in my mind, I guess, maybe in the back of my mind that we did have a direct connection with Africa. However, this was really not the force that drove me into the Peace Corps. I think working in the corporate world for so long I had just become a little bit -- I'm not sure of the word I want, I just felt like I could be doing a little bit more. And I had been teaching at Bell Laboratories, I was involved in what they called an Upward Mobility program, which involved mostly minorities, helping them to progress in the corporate world. What the strong force was that drove me to Africa, I can't really give a definite answer. I did stress though, when I went into the Peace Corps, I said I would like an African country, and it didn't matter where.    Ms. West: You mentioned that some of the teachers in the school motivated you and might have had an influence upon you. Did this have any connection with this area that you went to? Did these teachers help you decide that this is where you wanted to go?    Ms. Holimon: No, these were the teachers in elementary school. No, it's just that I was so impressed with the teaching, and in fact, I didn't realize how good these teachers were until I went to the Asbury Park High School. The elementary school teachers were all Black teachers and to me they surpassed the teachers that we had in high school. Of course, another fact or could have been that I felt that the teachers at the high school did not welcome us. The teachers really didn't go out of their way to teach the minority students. I don't think this was just my concept, I think a lot of us felt this way. But I guess I'm comparing the teachers at that time to some of the teachers that we have today. The teachers were more dedicated then. But at that time, you must remember that most of the female teachers were not married. Most of them never married, and maybe this was the reason why they put so much effort into teaching us. But I don't think that really had a bearing on my decision to go into the Peace Corps. I think I just felt that everything was just so materialistic, and I wanted to sort of get away from that for a while.    Ms. West: If you were to see some of these teachers who did influence you and apparently had a great interest in their students and a desire to teach, is there anything that you would like to say to them if you could?    Ms. Holimon: Oh, I wish I could just thank them for their dedication and their great teaching skills. Even today some of my peers and I often talk about how great these teachers were.    Ms. West: Was there any particular location in Monmouth County that has any special significance to you?    Ms. Holimon: I guess where I was born, Asbury Park. We were from a very poor family, and my mother and father separated when I was about two or three years old, so most of my memories are of my mother doing domestic work to take care of her six children. And even though we were on friendly terms with our father because he still lived in the community, most of my memories are of my mother and her hard work.    Ms. West: You mention your education and all here in Monmouth County. What kind of childhood did you have here in the County? What are your fondest memories ?    Ms. Holimon: I think I had a good childhood even though we were poor. My mother came from Pennsylvania originally and moved into this area. The area where she grew up, West Chester, Pennsylvania, was, I guess you would say, very high on education. And even though she did not finish high school, I was impressed that she seemed to be well educated. She read books when she was ten and twelve years old. She mentioned she had read Les Miserables, and other books of this caliber at an early age. The fact that she was educated I guess helped us, even though she didn't go very far in school.    Ms. West: Speaking of your mother reading books, did you have a favorite author as a youngster, or today?    Ms. Holimon: I think I tried to read some of the books that she told me that she had read, but I wondered, how did she ever read these books? I think when I was coming up, I was reading mostly mystery novels, and I wasn't really into high literature at that time. It wasn't until I went back to college that I really started reading some of the books that my mother had read as a child. I guess I forgot to mention that when I got the job at Bell Laboratories, I continued to go to college, but I went at night. So it took me six years to get my degree in psychology because I was going part-time, and I was thirty-five years old when I finally got my degree.    Ms. West: How has the county changed over the years? Was there an area where you grew up, just the county within itself, assuming you've traveled around in the county?    Ms. Holimon: Well, I didn't really do too much traveling before the Asbury Park Village was built. We moved there in 1941.     Ms. West: What is the Asbury Park Village?    Ms. Holimon: It's a housing project located right off of West Lake Avenue, right behind West Lake Avenue. It was one of the first housing projects that was built in the county. Prior to that, we lived one year in one little bungalow, and the next year we might be living in another bungalow. We went from place to place and I can always remember the rent was always due and we really didn't have balanced meals. We really were poor. We didn't have electricity until we moved into the housing project. So I was fifteen years old before we moved into what we thought was just great living. And as far as traveling around in Monmouth County, we really didn't do much traveling. At that time we didn't have a car in the family, we and most of my peers at that time were all just about on the same level. There were only just a few classmates who, as you'd say, lived comfortably. We accepted it as our lifestyle. I can recall going to work in the summertime. At that time you could work at an early age, and at thirteen a girlfriend and I both started working in Ocean Grove. At that time Ocean Grove was an area that catered to the people coming from the city. It was like a resort. They had many hotels and lots of employment for minorities. Your waiters, your waitresses, your busboys, in fact, most of the employees in Ocean Grove were Black. We couldn't live in Ocean Grove, but we could work there. And this was a means of my getting money for my school clothes. And my girlfriend and I would go to Ocean Grove every summer.    Ms. West: Where is Ocean Grove located?    Ms. Holimon: Ocean Grove is considered a part of Neptune, New Jersey.     Ms. West: What type of resort was it?    Ms. Holimon: Really, a very religious area. There was a beachfront, and it was a religious area. In fact, at the time when we worked there, Ocean Grove did not allow cars to come into the community on Sundays  Saturday night the people had to bring their cars out. Of course there were no taverns or places like that in that community. There is a very strong Methodist affiliation there. And it has remained that way. But it was a means of providing employment. Many college students from the south would come up for the summer just to work in Ocean Grove. We worked from say early morning until maybe six o'clock in the evening. By six or seven o'clock we had to be out of Ocean Grove and we would come across the tracks to Asbury Park. That was, at the time, Springwood Avenue, which now has been changed to West Lake Avenue. But when we finished our work we would come across the bridge. There was a small bridge from Ocean Grove to Asbury, and we would cross that bridge and make it on the other side of town. Even though we were returning to our neighborhood, which in most cases was quite poor, we were just so happy to cross that track and get back on Springwood Avenue. Ocean Grove was really a means of survival. In fact, we had employment in Ocean Grove when we couldn't even get employment in Asbury Park. Some of the hotels would not hire us unless they hired some of us as chambermaids. They didn't hire minority waitresses or waiters in Asbury Park at that time.    Ms. West: Did you have a favorite radio program that you liked to listen to when you were coming up?    Ms. Holimon: We didn't have a radio until we went to the Village. Before we moved in the Village, our last residence, I can remember, was 1148 Madison Avenue in Asbury Park. Next door to us was a store owned by Italians, and I can remember listening to the Joe Louis fights. There was a little walkway between the store and our house, and when Joe Louis would fight, we would go put our ear up against the wall and listen to his fights. Other than that, I don't have any memories of any radio shows until after I was fifteen years old!    Ms. West: But you were happy!    Ms. Holimon: Oh, yes, yes, yes! Happy and didn't realize how happy we were.    Ms. West: Did you have any heroes or heroines when you were coming up?    Ms. Holimon: Only later on when, in 1947, Jackie Robinson came into baseball. Joe Louis was our first hero, and I guess the next hero was Jackie Robinson, who, to me, was just a wonderful, wonderful person. I guess most of our heroes were in sports. There was nothing really at that time in the movies, or in the theater that attracted me. We would go to the movies on Saturdays, but I was never a movie buff. At that time there was one theater called the Realto, and another called the Savoy. We, as Blacks, had to sit upstairs. We were not allowed to sit downstairs in the theatres. Downstairs was for Whites only.    Ms. West: Do you remember the first movie that you ever saw?    Ms. Holimon: I can't recall. I think it might have been a Jean Harlow movie, but I'm not sure. Every Saturday, most of my peers went to the theater and most of the movies were westerns, cowboys and Indians, and I was never impressed with that. My sister liked Shirley Temple, and she would go to the Shirley Temple movies. Even to this day, I'm just not a movie person. I guess I felt it was just too much make believe, and I was never really impressed with the movies.    Ms. West: Is there any newspaper headline that stands out in your mind over the years?    Ms. Holimon: Oh, I can remember the Lindbergh kidnapping. Also, the Hindenburg crash, which was, I think, just before we moved into the projects. I can recall seeing the Hindenburg go over by our home and, of course, the headlines the next day about the crash.    Ms. West: What was the Hindenburg?    Ms. Holimon: That was the German zeppelin aircraft that was making its first visit to the United States, and it crashed right here in Lakehurst, New Jersey. Later on, much, much later (I was married then), I can remember when Malcolm X was assassinated and seeing this horrible picture on the front page of the Daily News. I don't remember exactly what the headline was, but the White people were rejoicing that this man was dead. It showed him lying there, and the headlines were written in such a way that it was like it was a good thing that the White media was glad this had happened.     Ms. West: Who was Malcolm X?    Ms. Holimon: Malcolm X was a Black activist who preached about the inequality between the Blacks and the Whites. At one time he even preached almost a hate of the White race, but as he matured and moved on in the world, he had changed in his views about his hatred considerably. To me he's a hero to the Black community.    Ms. West: Where was he killed?    Ms. Holimon: He was killed in New York, in Harlem. They were having a rally at the time in one of the local buildings.    Ms. West: When did you get a television?    Ms. Holimon: When did we get television? You know, I'm not even sure now when we got television. I don't remember, but I remember when the first television came into the Black neighborhood. It was at the home of Dr. Carter, a Black medical doctor, who was very popular, and was very friendly. He had a huge basement, and whenever one of the Joe Louis fights occurred, he opened his doors to the people in the community. We just flocked to his house, those who could get in, just to see this television. Then, later on, we got a Black and White television at my home in the projects.    Ms. West: Speaking of Dr. Carter makes me think of medicine. How were medical facilities and things here in the area?    Ms. Holimon: The doctors made house calls at that time. Dr. Carter, Dr. Robinson, and Dr. Harris were the Black doctors in the community, but at least fifty percent of the Black people used the services of a Dr. Sebastian Vaccaro, who was an Italian. He would come to your house no matter what time it was. It could be two, three, four o'clock in the morning, and he would come from the East side of town to take care of the people in the Black community. At that time, when he would come, he was friendly, but also sort of like a braggart. He knew he was good. Sometimes the Whites think they are saying the right thing. It's like, "I'm good to you Black people." At that time it didn't please us much as being said in a negative way. When he came to town he always had a great big bankroll of money. He'd maybe charge two or three dollars, whatever, but he became a millionaire. But what was so impressive was, at that time, he could come to any part of the west side with this bankroll, and it would never occur to anyone to try and rob him. I guess he was never afraid. His wife was a nurse, and she came with him. He was just really dedicated. In fact, he was assigned to Jersey Shore Hospital, which, at that time, was Fitkin Hospital, and also to the Long Branch Hospital. He would perform so much at Fitkin Hospital, protesting the way that the Blacks were treated. Finally, he was barred from the hospital because of this. They took him off of the staff there. He really did fight for us. He is well remembered, and some people have named their children after him. Sebastian Villa, a senior housing facility here in Neptune, is named after Dr. Vaccaro. He would come anytime. I can recall my mother getting sick one time, and I couldn't reach him, so I had to call another White doctor. When Dr. Vaccaro came to the house around two o'clock in the morning, he was so angry with me. "Why did you call him?" I said, "I couldn't get you." He was just furious. You were only supposed to call him, you know. He died very young. He was, I think, fifty-one years old. He had a heart attack while sleeping. My mother was very sick during her later years, but I can remember Dr. Vaccaro coming two, three, four o'clock in the morning with his wife. The medical facilities at Fitkin Hospital were pretty rough. The emergency room was always crowded with minorities who had no money. At that time we didn't have hospitalization benefits like we have today, and we just had to wait, and wait, and wait. Sometimes we were treated well at Fitkin Hospital  sometimes we were not. Even today, some things have not changed that much at the Jersey Shore Hospital in the treatment of minority patients.     Ms. West: When you were growing up, what were the fads in your day?     Ms. Holimon: We danced a lot. We had our little dance hall on Springwood Avenue, and on the weekends we would go. They had little local bands. The young fellows in the community had their bands. We had quite a bit of talent between Asbury and Neptune. I guess that was it. Of course they had basketball, which was very popular. They had basketball clubs at that time - they don't seem to have them anymore. There were at least three or four teams in the Asbury/Neptune area, and then in Long Branch/Red Bank area, and they would compete. On Friday nights there were the basketball games at the Bangs Avenue School.    Ms. West: Did you have a favorite singer, or singers?    Ms. Holimon: Well, locally we had a lot of talent. As far as when we were coming up, I guess I was in the Ella Fitzgerald, Lionel Hampton era, and these people used to come to Asbury Park. But of course I wasn't old enough to go to these dances. My older sisters attended. We had a ballroom on Springwood Avenue, and Ella Fitzgerald, Lionel Hampton, Count Basie, Chick Webb, and others came and performed in Asbury Park.    Ms. West: Did you have any hobbies then?    Ms. Holimon: I guess I read a lot. I did mostly reading. And I say I did like to dance.    Ms. West: What would you say is your greatest achievement?    Ms. Holimon: I guess the work I did in Africa more than anything else. I consider that my greatest achievement was setting up the school and teaching there. But prior to that, when I worked at Bell Laboratories, I did instruct and guide many minority employees. I consider that quite significant also because some of them have done very well.    Ms. West: Since your tour with the Peace Corps have you been back to Africa?    Ms. Holimon: Yes, I came out of the Peace Corps in 1977. I retired from the Bell system in 1988. In 1990 I went back in the Peace Corps to Sierra Leone, West Africa. I was scheduled to serve two years, but Civil War broke out in 1991, and I was evacuated from that country and returned home. But I have continued to have ties with the people of Kenya and the people of Sierra Leone. I have been to Kenya seven times. I just recently returned from a trip to Kenya. That was my seventh trip.    Ms. West: And when was that?    Ms. Holimon: In February this year, 2000. I had the honor of seeing some of my students whom I had taught twenty-five years ago. We had sort of a reunion. Many of them are married with children, some have very good jobs in business. I recalled that at the time when I first met some of these young ladies they didn't even know what a typewriter looked like. It was good to see them. Some of them are even teaching now. So to me this was just a great accomplishment.    Ms. West: If you can describe your life as a road map, how would it be - uphill, downhill, sort of steady, rocky, whatever?    Ms. Holimon: When you come up in the poverty and struggle we did, and you see your mother struggling, at that time, things seemed to be rough. Then as you go along and become more educated, you see yourself accomplishing many things. When you look back you forget how rough it was. I guess now I can laugh at some of the things. However to a lot of people some of these things were tragic, or even insurmountable. I guess it was uphill, but, to me, the hill wasn't as high as I thought it was. I think one of the things that helped me adjust in Africa was the fact that I grew up with no electricity, no radio, and sometimes even no food, except for some bread and tea, which I often had three times a day. I think when I went to Africa, especially when I went in 1990 and lived in the bush area, where the conditions were very difficult, it didn't bother me that much, because I knew what it was like not have much food and some of the conveniences that we have here in our country.    Ms. West: What would you say is the most unusual thing about yourself?    Ms. Holimon: Maybe visiting Africa! I keep going back! I guess it's kind of unusual visiting so often, but I have formed a relationship with the people. Even though I know I'm not completely African, I know that Africa is part of my culture. It is where my roots began.    Ms. West: How different are things today then you thought they might have been when you were a child? When you were a youngster, would you say, " I would want to be this, that, I want to see this or that." How different are things?    Ms. Holimon: Well, I'm originally from Asbury Park. When I walk down Springwood Avenue, which I do very often, and when I ride around and look at some of the homes and the conditions, I see that things aren't much better than they were years ago. In fact, in many cases, things are worse because we have the problem with the young people now that we didn't have when I was coming up. We weren't involved in drugs, we didn't go in the bars. We didn't have to worry about excessive crime. The crime rate was not like it is now. You could walk down Springwood Avenue unafraid. I call it Springwood Avenue, but now it is called West Lake Avenue. The riots in 1970 took the life away from Springwood Avenue, but I still walk there. I think I do it mainly to remind myself, you know, how far I have come and just how great the street was. People often see me walking down the street and say, "You're crazy. You're walking down the avenue. You could get mugged." I reply, "I'm not afraid. This is where I came from."    Ms. West: Is there anything  that you think you would still like to accomplish, or do?    Ms. Holimon: Well, I'm trying to get a book published, and if I could get that done, I will be very happy.    Ms. West: Is it a book about Monmouth County?    Ms. Holimon: No, no. It's a book mostly about my experiences in Africa, and a short span in Iran, but it's mainly about my African experience.    Ms. West: So what would you consider the milestones in your life?    Ms. Holimon: Well, I guess the first one was getting that job at Fort Monmouth when I was seventeen. It was my entrance into the corporate world. I guess that was the first milestone. The second one, I guess, was graduating from Monmouth College at the age of thirty-five. And then I guess my marriage. Isn't marriage considered a milestone?! I haven't mentioned my marriage. I married Theodore Holimon, a local policeman, in 1948, and remain married. Although we separated in 1970, we remained friends. My husband visited me in Africa in 1976. We had reunited shortly before his death in 1987.    Ms. West: Do you have any children?    Ms. Holimon: No, we never had any children. When my husband died, he was a retired captain of the police force in Asbury Park. And one of the second highest ranking officers. He and Assemblyman Thomas Smith came along together at the same time. They both had a very rough time getting promotions because of racial discrimination, but they did overcome this. In fact, Assemblyman Smith became the Chief of Police and also the Mayor of Asbury Park. My husband did get as far as captain. However, he had to engage a lawyer before he was first hired as a patrolman. All because of the racial discrimination in the City of Asbury Park. Assemblyman Smith and my husband always made the highest grades on the police exams. But of course, you know there's a level of choosing, and they can pick one out of three. It wasn't until after they couldn't ignore them anymore, that they were finally promoted to various ranks.    Ms. West: What important legacy do you think you will leave to your friends and family?    Ms. Holimon: I guess my stressing education. Even today I try to impress upon the young people the importance of education. So many of them have dropped out of school, or even when they finished high school, or some even college, they just never went any further. I try to impress upon them how important it is to continue their education. In Africa, the children have to pay to go to school from the time they are maybe five or six years of age. Some of them don't even start until they are ten years old because they have to pay school fees. The children and young people here don't seem to understand that. I don't know whether they don't believe me when I tell them that in Africa they have to pay to send a child to school. They have to pay the entire time from the very beginning, and also pay for uniforms. They wear uniforms to school in just about all African countries. The average family is about eight children  that's standard - eight or more. Some of those children never get to school because of the school fees. Here you start school at five or six and it's free. To me education is just so important. I don't understand really why, in the year 2000, our education efforts seem to have gone down the drain.    Ms. West: Maybe children take too much for granted.    Ms. Holimon: I think so. Very often the parents of these children have good jobs. They give their children so much.  The children can't imagine not ever having a radio or television! Now they even have cell phones.    Ms. West: It's just a way of life. They just take it for granted. If you could relive your life, would there be any part of your life that you would like to live over?    Ms. Holimon: It's hard to say, I don't know. You say you never want to be poor, but then if I had come up with something, maybe I wouldn't have done as well as I have.     Ms. West: You didn't know you were poor!    Ms. Holimon: Oh, we knew we were poor. Maybe when we were five or six years old. I think I knew I was poor around six or seven. I'm sure I knew. We knew we were poor when we would wait for my mother to come home from her domestic job. We were waiting for her to bring us some food. The leftovers from the White people's kitchen. We knew we were poor!!    Ms. West: What major changes have you seen in your lifetime in this country?    Ms. Holimon: Well, I can see a lot of accomplishments over all by Blacks. They have positions that we never thought we would get. Within the communities of Asbury and Neptune, I don't like the idea that our public schools are now predominantly Black. The "White Flight" has been allowed in the communities. I think this has adversely affected education. When I went to Asbury Park High School, there were a handful of Blacks. The Ridge Avenue school in Neptune was always predominantly Black, but I believe Neptune High School was predominantly White. I don't think these changes in the public schools have helped the education of our surrounding communities. And this seems to be all over in Monmouth County: the Whites have been allowed to flee and go into other schools. At one time I think there was a written order that if you lived in a certain area, you went to that school. You were not allowed to go to another school, but now this has changed, and of course you have your private schools. Even the school in our Catholic Church now is mixed. I was amazed one day when I rode by and saw all these Black children at the Catholic school on Asbury Avenue. I was so surprised because at one time this was not permitted, or it just didn't happen. I think this has affected our education system. In Neptune the teachers are predominantly White, and I feel that they're not that interested in teaching the children, that it's just a job. I feel that they're just not that dedicated. When you listen to the students talking coming down the street, you'd think they weren't even going to school. The English that they use is horrific! So there's something wrong with the system. Most of the teachers in both the Asbury Park and Neptune Schools are not as skillful, dedicated, and proficient as the teachers we had many years ago.    Ms. West: What are your deepest values?    Ms. Holimon: I don't know if I know what you mean.    Ms. West: What are your values?    Ms. Holimon: I guess I would say respect for one another, not just my peers, but the young people, the older people.    Ms. West: What are your personal strengths?    Ms. Holimon: Hard work. Working hard is in all aspects, I guess. Not being afraid to take a challenge. I remember when my husband and I got our first home, we built it ourselves. We had a contractor who did the professional masonry work, but we literally built it ourselves. I can remember going out there and helping to dig the foundation on the corner of Bangs and Ridge Avenue. It took us four years, and we really only decided to build because we couldn't get a loan. My husband was a policeman at that time, and I was working at Fort Monmouth, but we still could not get a loan, or decent provisions because we were Black. So we decided, the heck with it, we'll build our own house. Of course, once we got started, we thought, how did we ever think to do such a stupid thing! But we did it, and when we finished four years later, it was our home. That was one of the hardest challenges, I guess, in my life.    Ms. West: What advice would you give to the present generation?    Ms. Holimon: Learn, learn, learn. That's my biggest hang-up. Get your education. Get your education first. Go through college. Even though you might have to work for it, get to that college. Don't come out of high school and say, "Oh, I'm going to work and I'll go to college later on." Because in most cases you don't. Get the education. Once you get the education you know what's going on, or you have an idea anyway. When I went to Monmouth College as an adult, I really felt uncomfortable because I was so much older than the other students, even though a lot of my classes were at night. But it made me angry also, because I didn't even know what they were talking about in a lot of subjects. This was because they (the White students) had been exposed to the arts and to books and all these different things that we as Blacks had no idea of. These subjects had not been given to us. And of course so many of us didn't get to college. Even today they say the admission scores are so unfair because we as minorities cannot relate to a lot of these questions. I found this was true. To this day I don't know how I passed that admission test at Monmouth, because some of the areas I had never been exposed to and I had no idea what they were talking about. I guess I just did some good guessing and passed.    Ms. West: Now that we're into the twenty-first century, how would you like to see things in the future? What would you like to share? What would you like to see accomplished that seems to have been bypassed in the twentieth century?    Ms. Holimon: I would like to see more integration of the schools. The students and the faculty. I think that's the only way things are going to change. I think now our schools have become Black, our public schools are predominantly minority, but it's only with a small percentage of minority teachers, and I don't think things are going to work as long as it stays this way. There's another side of that, because I've been led to believe that the Black colleges help the minority more so than the White colleges as far as their social environment is concerned. I guess there are pros and cons to this. We have public schools that are supposed to be integrated, but they are not. I don't see how it's going to work if you're going to have a huge concentration of Blacks in a predominantly White environment because Asbury Park and Neptune are still a predominantly White environment. And I can't see it working if you're going to have your schools like this. In your Black colleges, which are predominantly in the south, of course your Black population is higher, and maybe a stronger force, so maybe it's why a lot of our students attend the Black colleges. They do well because socially they are together.    Ms. West: Thank you for sharing your experiences with us. Is there anything more that you'd like to tell us?    Ms. Holimon: I think I've said enough.    Ms. West: Well, there never is enough, remember you said education, and this is education.    Ms. Holimon: I said I'd just like to be able to reach out more to the young people in the areas and stress the importance of the education. I try to do things in some of my presentations, but I can't seem to even get that audience anymore that I used to be able to get with the young people. I will just keep on trying.    Ms. West: I guess all we can do is try. We've come to the end, and once again, I thank you.     
MonmouthCounty;Pomphrey and Treiber;xxxx;2000;Pomphrey and Treiber, xxxx, 2000        Remembering the 20th Century: An Oral History of Monmouth County      Mina Pomphrey  Date of Interview: February 23, 2000    Subjects of the Interview: Russell Treiber and Mina Treiber Pomphrey   Name of Interviewer: Flora Higgins  Premises of the Interview: Monmouth County Library Headquarters, Manalapan, NJ  Birthdates of subjects: N/A  Deceased: Mina: April 16, 2002  Russell: August 7, 2002    Ms. Higgins: Well, welcome! We are most pleased that you came today to be a part of this oral history, Mina and Russ.    Ms. Pomphrey: Thank you.      Russell Treiber  Mr. Treiber: Thank you.    Ms. Higgins: New Bedford, a part of Wall Township, is where you spent most of your childhood. What early memories do you have about  going to school, for example?    Mr. Treiber: New Bedford was one of six school districts in Wall Township, as I recall. It was a two-room school, with I think perhaps a maximum of forty students. We had first through the sixth grade, and then the other two grades were in the second room.    Ms. Higgins: And who organized all this?    Mr. Treiber: We had two teachers. We had a principal and a teacher. The principal taught the higher grades.    Ms. Higgins: How high did the school go?    Mr. Treiber: Through the eighth grade. But there wasn't a kindergarten, just first through eighth grade.    Ms. Higgins: All in two rooms?    Mr. Treiber: Yes. I don't recall any kindergarten at our school at all.    Ms. Higgins: Actually kindergartens came and went in New Jersey, as I recall.    Mr. Treiber: It could be.    Ms. Pomphrey: We didn't have kindergarten in those days. You went right into first grade.    Ms. Higgins: Was there preschool?    Ms. Pomphrey: No.    Mr. Treiber: I was six years old before we entered the first grade. And there was no kindergarten  I know there wasn't.    Ms. Pomphrey: And there was no preschool.    Mr. Treiber: Our teacher, the one I recall, was Miss Osborne. She was a very beautiful lady, and all the boys were in love with her. When her boyfriend came to pick her up when school was over, we used to hiss at him and holler at him. And she was so embarrassed! (Laughter)    Ms. Higgins: Was that a local person, Miss Osborne?    Mr. Treiber: I don't recall where she lived. She came in a car and left in a car, which incidentally was very scarce in those days.    Ms. Higgins: Yes, if you were six that was in the 30s.    Mr. Treiber: Yes, it was back in like 1929 or 1930. But she was a great teacher, and I still recall her name. I guess that has some bearing on it.    Ms. Higgins: What kind of subjects did you have?    Mr. Treiber: Just the Three Rs, as I recall.    Ms. Pomphrey: They called it Arithmetic in those days, not Math.    Mr. Treiber: Reading, Writing and Arithmetic. That's all they had.    Ms. Pomphrey: Right! Reading, Writing and Arithmetic.    Ms. Higgins: So you went to the school, too, right behind Russell?    Ms. Pomphrey: Yes.    Mr. Treiber: Yes, she was two years behind me.    Ms. Pomphrey: Yes, we all did. There were five of us in the family.    Ms. Higgins: Were your people farmers? How did your people get to Wall Township?    Mr. Treiber: My father's family moved to Belmar, and opened a double house with a double bungalow in the back. They rented that out in the summer time. That was their income. My father met my mother there, and they moved up to New Bedford, and built a home in an old gravel pit there. It was a little one-room bungalow, actually.    Ms. Higgins: I am surprised there were so many school districts. Wall Township must have been very large, even then.    Mr. Treiber: I am not sure they were districts rather than neighborhoods, do you know what I mean? I don't know what the terminology was. We had one school superintendent, and he used to ride a bicycle.    Ms. Pomphrey: Well, it was quite a large place, a large township.    Ms. Higgins: Do you remember the superintendent's name?    Mr. Treiber: Yes, it was George Vanoot. The first week of school he would come on his bicycle with a basket, and he would have a soccer ball and something else in it. And that was the limit of our athletic equipment for recess. I always remembered him because he rode from school to school on his bicycle.    Ms. Higgins: With his ball.    Mr. Treiber: Well, he had one ball for each school, but he would come to the New Bedford school with a soccer ball.    Ms. Pomphrey: And then he would leave and go to another school, and teach what they call Physical Education today.    Ms. Higgins: Were the girls and boys together?    Ms. Pomphrey: Oh, yes.    Mr. Treiber: We had recess twice a day, once in the morning and once in the afternoon. And, like I said, they would grab the soccer ball and throw it out, and whatever you did with it was up to you. They didn't come out there with you.    Ms. Pomphrey: There was no teaching.    Mr. Treiber: No, there was no supervision of recess, other than to make sure no one punched someone else, or something like that.    Ms. Pomphrey: There was supervision just on the playground.    Mr. Treiber: The one thing I have to mention is that when recess was on, the first thing that happened was the long line that formed for the bathroom, which was in the back yard. The boys and girls would use the outhouses.    Ms. Higgins: Oh, was that on your recess time?    Mr. Treiber: Yes, we had to go during our recess time. It was very embarrassing! You had the finger method, you know. You held up one finger for one type of deed, and two fingers for another type of deed. And the teacher would either nod her head or shake her head. But anyhow, it was interesting. But that was the first part of recess: the first fifteen minutes was spent lined up at the outhouse in the back yard.    Ms. Higgins: Because I was thinking that two recesses, that was pretty nice. But I didn't realize the bathroom break was built into that as well.    Mr. Treiber: Well they were like thirty-minute recesses  they weren't very long.    Ms. Higgins: What was the school day?    Mr. Treiber: Probably 9:00 a.m. to 2:30 or 3:00 p.m. I don't know for sure.    Ms. Higgins: And did you go about the same as we do now, Labor Day to the late spring?    Mr. Treiber: Yes, we had the same seasons.    Ms. Pomphrey: I think it was 180 days. I think it has always been that, and it still is.    Mr. Treiber: That is a requirement by law, isn't it?    Ms. Pomphrey: Yes.    Mr. Treiber:  We never had a backstop for baseball, and there was never any field marked out. As a matter of fact, the field we used was owned by the fellow that owned the LeDeauville Inn, in Wall Township.    Ms. Higgins: What Inn?    Mr. Treiber: The LeDeauville Inn, it was called. It is where the high school is now. Mr. Duvak owned that, and he used to lend us one of his fields for the athletic field.    Mr. Treiber: Did all you children get along pretty well?    Ms. Pomphrey: Oh, yes.    Mr. Treiber: Yes.    Ms. Higgins: Well, you had to organize your own play.    Ms. Pomphrey: We're still friendly with whoever is left there. We'll go down and see them, and Russell attends church with Shirley Spade. Yes, we were very friendly with them. And we still have good friends from that time.    Mr. Treiber: An interesting part is that all of us boys from six to fifteen years old, and as a matter of fact, we had a couple of them that were nineteen years old in the eighth grade, we all had trap lines. We set traps for fur bearing animals, and that was one of the big things. We would come to school with a burlap bag with maybe a skunk in it, and we would throw it out by the steps. And when school was over, we'd pick up the bag and go home to skin the skunk. But everybody had a bag with a muskrat, skunk or a rabbit or something in it! (Laughter)    Ms. Higgins: What did you do with the skins, Russ?    Mr. Treiber: We skinned the animals out, and stretched and dried them. Then we had to walk two and a half  miles up the road to Bailey's Corner and sell them to Mr. Matthews, who had a fur business up there. He would buy it, and we used to get a quarter for a muskrat! Isn't that something?    Ms. Higgins: Yes. That was a lot of money then, wasn't it?    Ms. Pomphrey: Yes, it was.    Mr. Treiber: Skunks were worth fifteen cents.    Ms. Higgins: Weren't the skunks a little problematical?    Mr. Treiber: Well, we knew how to handle them. The only problem we had was when we got them in the trap, we had to kill them without getting wet. (laughter) And that was a problem.    Ms. Higgins: Because you were on your way to school.    Ms. Pomphrey: Yes, right.    Mr. Treiber: I just want to relate that the person who has fed the rumor that if you get the skunk's feet off the ground in the back he can't wet on you, was wrong. So we all occasionally smelled like skunks, but we didn't mind. Everybody else did, too.    Ms. Higgins: I have a vision that this activity of skinning small animals for their hides was a very Western thing, but apparently it was in New Jersey, too.    Mr. Treiber: It was local, sure. Almost every boy did it. That was your Christmas present. I remember when I got six muskrat traps for Christmas, and that was a big deal to us. We went and had them set in all the local brooks and streams, and we were pretty much experts, you know, on where a muskrat was and where he wasn't.    Ms. Higgins: What did they do with them...make hats and boots?    Mr. Treiber: Whatever! Coats or hats, they were shipped somewhere. Probably to New York. We didn't get into the high economics, we just went for our quarter.    Ms. Higgins: What did you do with the insides of the animal? Did you eat them?    Mr. Treiber: Just buried them. We had a black man that lived next to us, and he would eat muskrat. And we would eat it if he cooked it, but my mother wouldn't cook it.      Jesse Johnson  Ms. Higgins: What was his name?    Mr. Treiber: Jesse Johnson. At that time, he was known as a colored man.    Ms. Pomphrey: He was a very, very nice person.    Mr. Treiber: He was the greatest guy I ever met.    Ms. Higgins: Did he have kids?    Mr. Treiber: No, he was single when he first moved in. Then he brought a bride up from Virginia. And that was her name, Virginia, as a matter of fact.    Ms. Higgins: Were they farmers?    Mr. Treiber: He worked for the Justice of Peace, who lived right behind us in Wall Township. The Justice of Peace's name was Neil Auger, which is a famous name around here.    Ms. Pomphrey: It is still a well-respected name in Wall Township.    Ms. Higgins: Bailey's Corner, is that where the Municipal Building is now?    Mr. Treiber: Yeah, it is on that road. Right. That road used to run all the way across from Dundola to Village Corner.    Ms. Higgins: So you made all these quarters. What did you do with the quarters?    Mr. Treiber: We ran as fast as we could to the candy store. (Laughter)    Ms. Pomphrey: We had one right on the corner by us.    Mr. Treiber: You know for a nickel you could come out of there with a whole bag full of green leaves, or root beer barrels, and I'm not going to tell you the name of the other little licorice candy we got. I don't want to get sued! But anyhow, that was the reason for the money raising. Nobody ever told us to give Mom fifteen cents or anything like that.    Ms. Higgins: Was that primarily how you made money as a child, with the trapping?    Mr. Treiber: There was no allowance that I recall in those days.    Ms. Higgins: What did you do for money, Mina?    Ms. Pomphrey: I don't know. My brothers shared with me when they bought candy, but I don't have the memory my brother does of all this.    Mr. Treiber: Is it selective?    Ms. Pomphrey: I do remember the Monmouth County Library truck coming, and we could go in there. It was like a small bus.    Ms. Higgins: I can show you pictures of that! It was our bookmobile!    Ms. Pomphrey: Right.    Mr. Treiber: That's right.    Ms. Pomphrey: Was it maybe twice a month or twice a year?    Mr. Treiber: Oh, it was a couple times a year.    Ms. Pomphrey: Yes, it would arrive and we were enthralled to have access to that many books at once because they didn't have any books in our school, like you can go to the school library now and pick out a book. You couldn't do that in those days.    Ms. Higgins: I can't imagine a time when you just didn't have access to all the books you ever wanted, although I must have lived through that time as well. Mina, do you remember what you would like to read?    Ms. Pomphrey: Just child books. I wasn't ever too into science. Russ probably would have liked the science books, and my other brother would have, also. And I read all the little girl books, and I am trying to think of their names.    Mr. Treiber: There was a series of books called The Big Little Books. The appearance was a little square, but they were really thick. They were the popular ones.    Ms. Pomphrey: There is a name for the books that I liked, and I forget what it was.    Ms. Higgins: Was it Little House in the Prairie?    Ms. Pomphrey: One of those, yes. And there was another series of books.    Mr. Treiber: Dick and Jane!    Ms. Pomphrey: Well, that was in first grade, Russ.    Ms. Higgins: Oh, did you read Little Women?    Ms. Pomphrey: That's what I am trying to think of, Little Women. They were interesting. But then I left there when I was eleven years old. One of my memories is not about school. Up past our house was this huge mansion, and wealthy people lived there. And their name was Buxbomb. But it now has become a convent, right Russ?    Mr. Treiber: Yes.    Ms. Pomphrey: It is used as a convent by the nuns. But they used to have an orchard, and we would go up there. I have never found it yet, but they had an apple that if you picked it, it would taste like bananas. It was delicious. But it would taste like a banana.    Mr. Treiber: They were called banana apples, right?    Ms. Pomphrey: Yes. We used to go up there, and the people were very generous in letting us pick. I guess they knew we were there, I don't know.    Mr. Treiber: They had apple trees in their front yard.    Ms. Pomphrey: As long as you didn't go over on their main property.    Ms. Higgins: Apple farming is big business in Monmouth County. Potatoes and apples.    Ms. Pomphrey: Right. We used to walk up there and get up in a tree, and we would drop down in the creek to go swimming.    Ms. Higgins: May I ask you what you wore?    Ms. Pomphrey: A wool suit! Until I got it wet, I couldn't stand it. But that's what we wore.    Mr. Treiber: And it used to be that you covered your knees, too.    Ms. Pomphrey: Oh, yes, it was way down by your knees. And it was just plain wool.    Ms. Higgins: What creek would that be?    Mr. Treiber: That was Cherel Brook, the one that we used to swim in up there. Wall Wash Sand & Gravel Company was just starting up when we were little children.    Ms. Higgins: Oh, ok. And did that company bring in a lot of people?    Mr. Treiber: That was probably the biggest industry we had in that area. And then Mr. Dubak, who was an immigrant from Switzerland, came in and he bought what used to be the New Bedford Hotel. That was a stage stop, incidentally, that hotel. And he bought that, and he turned it into a really, really high-class restaurant. I am talking about limousines and Rolls-Royces, and all the big boys were there on weekends, with chauffeurs.    Ms. Pomphrey: We used to go down and peek at them, when they came in their limousines. You know in those days, to see a big car roll up like that was a real luxury.    Ms. Higgins: Do you remember that name of the restaurant?    Mr. Treiber: LeDeauville.    Ms. Higgins: Oh yes, I have seen that name around.    Mr. Treiber: The place burned down, and then he moved to a mansion up in another part of Wall Township. You probably remember the one on Rumson Mill Road, up in the northwestern part of Wall Township.    Ms. Higgins: Yes.    Mr. Treiber: But this one was at Eighteen and New Bedford Road. That's where the high school is.    Ms. Higgins: Were your parents born in New Jersey or Monmouth County?    Mr. Treiber: Our parents were from Newark. Well, our father was born in Newark.    Ms. Pomphrey:  I am trying to think of the street where it was all Germans.    Mr. Treiber: There was Hamburg Place, until World War I. Then they may have changed it to Clinton Avenue! (Laughter) Yeah, they didn't like the Germans!    Ms. Pomphrey: You could do things in those days, couldn't you? You could change the name of the street because you didn't like something.      Grandma Mount  Mr. Treiber: Our mother is from Manasquan, and her family goes right back to the Indians on the Manasquan River. Actually I just got a picture of my grandmother from Manasquan, whom I have never seen.  I got it through the Internet. I found a long-lost cousin on the Internet, and this is amazing, I am telling you. It was the first time I saw her.  But it brought tears to me eyes, you know, because I had never seen her. Evidently she died before I was born.  But there is more about that mansion that was built by Mr. Buxbomb. He was a Wall Street financier. He used to commute daily on the train to New York. They were very generous people. On Halloween, we would have to run real fast to make fourteen stops. So we would go up there. He had two large, great big Great Danes. He would put them in and tie them, because he knew we would come. And they would open the door, and we would go in. They would have cider and doughnuts, always.    Ms. Pomphrey: I remember that.    Mr. Treiber: Also Mr. Dubak, the man who owned the LeDeauville Inn, he would open that up and give us ice cream, cake, and a quarter. Do you remember he always gave you a quarter?    Ms. Pomphrey: Yes.    Mr. Treiber: And they were big thrills to us, you know. It was a big time. And Mr. Buxbomb would hold an annual horse show up there. He had stands to sit in, you know.    Ms. Pomphrey: Yes, I remember those.    Mr. Treiber: We children would go up and sit in the top row, and all these high, fancy rich people would come and say, "Get out of here, you little brats!" And Mr. Buxbomb would say, "That's their seat. Leave them alone!" And I'm getting emotional.    Ms. Higgins: That's very nice. What kind of horse show? Was it like we have today?    Mr. Treiber: Yes, the jumpers, and they would trot and pace. It was a New Jersey sponsored horse show. But he always was generous.    Ms. Pomphrey: That was a big thing, a big outing for us.    Ms. Higgins: What became of Mr. Buxbomb?    Mr. Treiber: His family still lives in Spring Lake. Bobby is still around, and Bobby was his son. Of course he didn't go to our school, he went to a private school. But he was always friendly with those of us who were around. And they were very generous. Now one other thing is that at that period: Prohibition was a big boost for our Township.    Ms. Higgins: I was going to ask you about Prohibition.    Mr. Treiber: Everybody was in the speakeasy business or making beer. As a matter of fact, my uncle was a booze runner.    Ms. Pomphrey: News to me. (Laughter) I'm learning a lot today!    Mr. Treiber: Now I lived on 18th Avenue, which runs east and west. My brother and I were in the front yard one day, and we saw these three cars come by. And these guys were hanging out the windows with rifles and shotguns, and going real fast. So we thought there was something going on. So we got on our bikes, and we both tried to go and see. We went a little ways, and we heard a huge explosion. And we found out later that these were "G-Men" who had gone to raid a still on a dairy farm just up the street from us. That was Hall's Farm, and I don't know whether or not you want to use his name.    Ms. Higgins: Yes, we do.    Mr. Treiber: But the still blew out the whole side of the hill there, and one or two people were killed. That's why these men were there  the agents had come to raid that still. I can remember we went home and hid under our bed. We didn't want any part of that stuff. But that was an interesting period. And the Ku Klux Klan was very, very active in that area.    Ms. Higgins: I have heard that. Tell us about it.    Mr. Treiber: Well, there is a big hotel  at Camp Edwards. That was relatively new when we were children. Well, the Ku Klux Klan used to meet there every summer. They had some kind of pow-wows, or whatever they called them. They would have fires out on the front there, and everybody was in that stupid little hood. And they were very active. As I told you previously, this Black man lived next door to us. And the Klan came one time to harass him, and my father went to his defense. And then I think it was a week or two later, we found my father all beat up down in the field.    Ms. Higgins: No!    Mr. Treiber: But we could never prove anything, you know. I'm not going to name the names of the Klan members, but they were local boys.    Ms. Pomphrey: The hoboes is one of memories of years ago living up there. They would have a stick and a little thing, and they would come around just for anything to eat. But I heard this story from my little friend, who is 100 years old. She said that around Trenton at that time they would leave a little mark on your fence somewhere to tell the other hoboes to stop there, that those people would give you something to eat.     Mr. Treiber: They didn't get much at our place, did they?      Charles Treiber  Ms. Pomphrey: No, because our parents had five children. But that has always been so interesting to me. If we were to tell our grandchildren that, they wouldn't believe it. They had a little stick and a little package of clothes, I guess. They really did come around in those days a lot.    Ms. Higgins: Did they ever work for the money?    Mr. Treiber: They would offer to, but not seriously. There wasn't any work!    Ms. Pomphrey: I don't remember the Depression, but evidently that was part of it. I know Mama sent us to the store to get a loaf of bread, and we would want to go to the store because the one that went could have the heel or crust of the bread. And that was a big treat to get fresh bread, and you could have the heel if you went to the store! It was five cents a loaf.    Ms. Higgins: How long did it take you to walk to the store?    Ms. Pomphrey: That store was right on the corner. I would say it was about a block, wouldn't you, Russell?    Mr. Treiber: Yes. It is still there, but it's a pizza place now.    Ms. Pomphrey: It's still there, in fact. But I have walked to Belmar, to 13th Avenue where my grandmother had her home, and I would say that is a mile. Would you say that is about right, Russ?    Mr. Treiber: Oh, are you kidding? It was about four miles.    Ms. Pomphrey: I would go down for an onion if my mother needed it. I'd have to walk down that far, across the highway, to get an onion.    Mr. Treiber: Kind of scary, wasn't it?    Ms. Pomphrey: But there weren't a lot of cars then. We walked to church to Sunday School, and how far was that? I would say a mile, right Russ? I think about a mile. But we would walk to  every Sunday School every Sunday     Mr. Treiber: The church was full of children.    Ms. Higgins: What church was it?    Mr. Treiber: That little Wall United Methodist.    Ms. Pomphrey: Russell is still a member.    Mr. Treiber: I have been a member there since 1929.    Ms. Higgins: Was it a new church when you started going?    Mr. Treiber: No, it was built in 1854.    Ms. Pomphrey: It has since then burnt down and been rebuilt. I don't know what year, though.    Mr. Treiber: It was started as a Methodist Meeting in 1838. And in 1854 they built the church, which is on a hill, and the fishing boats could see the light. You know they used to have a night light on top of the church as a guide to the boats out there in the ocean. Believe it or not, you could see that light from the ocean. Now you can't.    Ms. Higgins: Did that church have any connection with Ocean Grove? Wasn't that a Methodist Campground?    Mr. Treiber: All Methodist churches were individuals. The Methodist Episcopal churches were all individual, self-supporting at that time. Then they conferenced up in 1944, or something like that.    Ms. Higgins: When you went to Belmar, did you ever go bathing in the ocean?    Mr. Treiber: Oh, please, again with the wool bathing suit!    Ms. Pomphrey: You too, occasionally. Everyone did. They didn't have anything else.    Mr. Treiber: I was so embarrassed to go down to that beach with my grandmother and my aunt, with their long stockings and woolen suits, and that bathing hat. And never once did they ever go in the water! I never saw them go in the water.    Ms. Higgins: This was your mother's mother?    Mr. Treiber: No, this was my father's mother. My mother's mother, I never met. My mother had eight brothers and one sister. And I am just now locating or finding out what happened to everyone. They are all gone except one aunt.      Grandma Treiber  Ms. Pomphrey: Mother was a triplet, and she was the only survivor.    Mr. Treiber: She was born at home, if you believe it or not.    Ms. Pomphrey: I think I have said this before, but she knew sign language. And it's really coming back to us now, because my granddaughter Kelly is a sign language interpreter. So you wonder how that all comes back around. My dad was a carpenter, and now my son is in the home improvement business. So you just wonder if it does all come back again, you know.    Mr. Treiber: Remember I told you we had a Justice of the Peace that lived behind us?    Ms. Higgins: Yes.    Mr. Treiber: The State Police used to police Wall Township then. There wasn't any local police force or anything. We had one constable: do you remember his name?    Ms. Pomphrey: No I don't, Russ. My memory is not like it used to be.    Mr. Treiber: But anyhow on a Saturday or Sunday, the constable or a State Trooper would bring a person that they caught violating the law to the Justice of the Peace's office. And that guy would have to pay right there. Three dollars went to the Justice of the Peace, one dollar went to the Township, and one dollar to the police officer. We used to stand there and watch that, you know. They think kids are dumb, but we knew what was going on.    Ms. Higgins: I thought those kinds of things happened in other states.    Mr. Treiber: The constable would hire my brother and me to pull weeds in his farm or garden, and he would give us ten cents an hour. He would look at the end of the day and if he found any weeds, he wouldn't pay us. He'd say we didn't do it properly. He was the nastiest guy!    Ms. Pomphrey: One of my memories was of Daddy's garden. One of my chores was to go out with a can of kerosene and pick the bugs off the potatoes, and then I'd throw them in the kerosene. That was my job.    Mr. Treiber: Yes, the potato bugs.    Ms. Pomphrey: I probably missed many of the bugs.    Ms. Higgins: It must have been some dinner hour with you reeking of kerosene and Russ of skunks! (Laughter)    Ms. Pomphrey: But in those days, we made root beer.    Ms. Higgins: How do you make root beer?    Ms. Pomphrey: I don't remember, but we used to do it.    Mr. Treiber: She used water, and they had a root beer syrup that you would buy in the store in a funny-shaped bottle.    Ms. Pomphrey: And we used to put it under the house, I know, to keep it cold.    Mr. Treiber: Yes, it ages. Aging is what gives it the flavor.    Ms. Pomphrey: Right. And we used to have a taffy pull. Somehow, you know, you would pull the taffies. And then what they call "S'mores" now with the graham crackers. Mother's wasn't that fancy, but we did that. In those days you didn't go out and buy all that, you did it with your children. And they are our greatest memories, you know, of things we did. She took us swimming, and we had fun together. We played kick-the-can.    Mr. Treiber: We made our own games.    Ms. Pomphrey: Yes, we just had a lot of fun. And you played with your brothers and sisters, and of course we had a lot of children around there. There were families that were very close to us, so it was nice. So you didn't feel like you had to be taken somewhere. As I say, we walked to Sunday School. You weren't driven like you are today. If your child today wants to go a block away, they are taken there. Not us. But I think it made better people out of us.    Mr. Treiber: This Sand and Gravel Company moved in there when we were very small. They brought a dredge in, and within months, this huge lake was forming. They were pumping the sand and washing the gravel, and separating the sand and gravel. It became a huge lake, and that's where we swam when we were children.    Ms. Pomphrey: Yes.      Alice Mount Treiber  Mr. Treiber: My mom was a Gertrude Ederly and Florence Chadwick fan, you know. This was the age for the channel swim by the women. And my mom would go in the Shark River, wade in where Belmar is, and then swim out the channel and come back again. You see that was the big sports thing for women in her age group.    Ms. Pomphrey: She was a great swimmer.    Ms. Higgins: How about skating: did you skate on that lake?    Mr. Treiber: Oh, we went skating on Dubak's pond, didn't we? We had a bonfire.    Ms. Pomphrey: Yes, that was right across from the big restaurant. He would let you go on his property...he knew us.    Mr. Treiber: Mr. Dubak was such a kind man. He was the owner of the LeDeauville Inn.    Ms. Pomphrey: Children weren't as destructive then. But you respected property, and people respected you in return for that. And we were allowed to go up to that big mansion and get some apples, or we were allowed to go on his property and skate.    Mr. Treiber: But we didn't bother anything when we were children.    Ms. Pomphrey: As long as we behaved, we were allowed to go anywhere in the neighborhood.    Mr. Treiber: You know what they would do in Mr. Dubak's pond? He used to get the train every morning to go to New York. If it snowed, the County didn't have the equipment to plow snow, so he would hire a group of men to come up there with a horse and wooden plow to dig him out so he could get down to the train station. They would come by our house with snow flying all over the place. And he always made it. But he paid for that himself  the township didn't pay for it. That's a lot of memories. But this Wall Wash was our favorite.    Ms. Pomphrey: Oh, yes.    Ms. Higgins: The what?    Mr. Treiber: We called The Wall Wash Sand & Gravel Company  the  Wall Wash. That was our swimming place.    Ms. Higgins: Oh, ok.    Ms. Pomphrey: That was our swimming place, our private pool. Actually many families went there, it wasn't just us. We had one or two horses that fell in there and drowned. They would back up and dump the sand, and then the wagon would pull the horses in. That happened a couple of times. That's how deep it was. So you had to be careful. You had to have someone like your mother with you.    Mr. Treiber: There was a lot of quicksand then.    Ms. Pomphrey: Yes. And to this day I am afraid to go under water because my older brother had a girlfriend, and I must have said something she didn't like. And she held my head under the water. Every time I would come up, she would sit on my head! So I am scared to go under water to this day.      Ms. Higgins: Was that your girlfriend, Russ?    Ms. Pomphrey: No, it was my older brother Hank's girlfriend.    Mr. Treiber: Hank was a teenager then.    Ms. Higgins: Do you remember when you stopped being so admiring of your teacher and fell in love with one of your classmates?    Mr. Treiber: That was a long time later. You always had little crushes in school. If we were bad, Miss Osborne's punishment for a boy was to make him sit with a girl. (Laughter) And she invariably put me with Isabelle Kemper, whom I loved. So I would be bad just so she would sit me next to Isabelle! (Laughter) And oh, I thought she was the greatest. But you know, we were seven or eight years old. But there were romances in the school with the older kids.    Ms. Pomphrey: I remember at school we had a little Christmas party, and I am sure it was Hank that got stuck in the chimney. He was Santa Claus.    Mr. Treiber: Yes, he got knocked out.    Ms. Pomphrey: He got stuck in the chimney. And you know, I am a giggler anyway, so I was half giggling and half crying while he was stuck in there!    Mr. Treiber: I'll explain how that happened. Between the two rooms was a door. And they put the fireplace at the door so he could come in from the other room out of the fireplace. He had a pack on his back, you know, for the little kids. We had these two big, heavy candlesticks that somebody had brought in to use. And he hit this cardboard fireplace, and one of them came down and hit him on the head. And he was out cold on the floor. And all the kids were hollering and screaming. (Laughter)    Ms. Pomphrey: This was a two-room schoolhouse, and we were trying to have a Christmas party.    Mr. Treiber: Oh, I remember that. I remember I played Tiny Tim in the school play. They used to do that once a year.    Ms. Pomphrey: Whenever I played any part, I was always the Ghost of the Past in black.    Mr. Treiber: The Christmas Carol was the only one they ever did.    Ms. Pomphrey: I did that probably there, and then I did it in high school. And I also did it in our church. I always dressed in black.    Mr. Treiber: I remember Mr. Vanoot, at the beginning of the school year, he brought in a thing you put slides in that I think they called a stereoscope or something. Is that what they call it?    Ms. Higgins: And it's dimensional?    Mr. Treiber: Yes, we were so thrilled. We had to put our names down on a piece of paper, and they held extra hours after school for kids to look through that.    Ms. Higgins: They are still fascinating to me.    Ms. Pomphrey: They are.    Ms. Higgins: It's amazing the way they can do that.    Ms. Pomphrey: Really the children are missing so much. I don't like to keep going back to that, but they are.    Mr. Treiber: I think they are missing the old method of teaching in individual and neighborhood schools. It is far superior to what they have now, I think.    Ms. Pomphrey: Yes, not only that, but just the comradeship and fellowship you built through the years with people.    Mr. Treiber: Because you weren't dealing with 500 or 1,000 students. We had probably forty. Alice Spade was one of three who graduated from the eighth grade in New Bedford one year. After the War started, there were only three kids that graduated.    Ms. Higgins: Why, where were the others?    Mr. Treiber: Oh, in the service or gone. You know kids quit when they were sixteen and they could go to work. We had several students who were eighteen or nineteen years old in there that they just couldn't move. One kid said he stayed in the seventh grade for years. When I asked him why, he said because his father was in the eighth grade! (Laughter)    Ms. Pomphrey: What is that building now, Russ? Is it like the Municipal Building?    Mr. Treiber: It's their Board of Education building. Have you ever been through there?    Mr. Treiber: Then behind that was the old school before this one was used.    Ms. Pomphrey: And one of our very good friends next door, who owned a home and a printing business, had life rights to that house. She passed away last year, so now the township took over all that property.    Mr. Treiber: He was a janitor, and he lived right next door. I don't know whether I mentioned this, but all of us young boys got our sex education out of National Geographic. Looking at the African pictures, you know! You've probably heard that before, but it is true. Somebody would whisper, "Look at that..." It was so funny! Miss Osborne was very considerate of the children and protective of our innocence in the first through the sixth grade. One day we looked in the yard next door to the school, and there were a couple of dogs that had been enjoying one another. And they were stuck together. So she went around and pulled the shades down so we couldn't see it, but we had already noticed it. We were used to that, you know, because we were farm kids. But she was protecting our innocence. She was a very young woman, and I think it was called Normal School that she graduated from. It was a teacher's school, but I think they called it Normal School. But anyhow, she was a great teacher. I don't think you needed a Masters Degree or anything like that in those days. They were always women, but the principal was always a man! Mr. Trowbridge was my mentor, I guess. He was a short, stocky, little football player.    Ms. Pomphrey: I remember the name, yes.    Ms. Higgins: And he was the Superintendent or the Principal?    Mr. Treiber: He was the Principal of the school.    Ms. Higgins: Did you ever get sent to him?    Mr. Treiber: Only when I got out of the sixth grade and went into the seventh. He was a very, very mild man. I met Mr. Miller, the principal, one year. And I'll tell you how I met him. They planted a row of little cedar trees along the side of the school driveway, and they were great for vaulting over. You would just run and hop over. But one day I landed in the middle of one. And he came out and beat me with a geography book, and he had me by the hair. (Laughter) Evidently he had paid for putting the trees in.    Ms. Higgins: Oh, and you broke one!    Mr. Treiber: But he beat me, you know! I didn't dare tell my father though, because I know what I would have gotten. I would have gotten another one.    Ms. Pomphrey: Yes, Daddy wouldn't have gone to him and told him he shouldn't have done that.    Mr. Treiber: And you know what I remember very clearly? It was a gray geography book with a picture of Columbus on the front of it. I bet they have still have those books in the library.    Ms. Higgins: Did you go on to high school?    Mr. Treiber: We were moved. Mina and I were moved out of there to Marlboro, and we went into a foster home. And I went to Freehold High School and then Leonardo.    Ms. Higgins: Did you know a John O'Brien in Leonardo High School? He was about your age, and he went there.    Mr. Treiber: No, not unless he played football. I remember Truex, who was the greatest coach that ever lived.    Ms. Higgins: What did he coach?    Mr. Treiber: Everything. He coached everything. If you went out to play football with Ernie Truex, you played football whether you were good or bad. He put you in that game even if you didn't remember which way to run. He thought if you came out to play, you were going to play.    Ms. Pomphrey: That's great.    Mr. Treiber: That's what they are supposed to do.    Ms. Pomphrey: That's right.    Mr. Treiber: You can't just have stars, you know. I remember the first play of the first game with Atlantic Highlands. I was playing right tackle, and we did a play and I got flattened right out. The cheerleaders all ran out on the field, picked me up, dragged me in, and put me on their lap. (Laughter) And I didn't want to get better.    Ms. Higgins: Boy, your brother got knocked out as Santa Claus, and you got knocked out playing football.    Mr. Treiber: Going back to the schools, there was great animosity between the schools. They were all different little schools in the township. If some kid from Glendola walked into the New Bedford territory, it was trouble. We had little scrimmages in baseball, like four people on a team. We never could get a full team. The farthest I ever went when I played soccer for New Bedford was over at Oakhurst, and we thought we would never get there and back.    Ms. Higgins: How did you go?    Mr. Treiber: A couple of parents took their cars and took us over. There were no vehicles available from the School Board, of course. We went over there, and we won. We beat Oakhurst. We all had these farm boots on and a pair of overalls, no uniform! (Laughter) As a matter of fact, I don't know if we even had a soccer ball.    Ms. Higgins: While Mina was picking potato bugs, what were your chores?    Mr. Treiber: We had all kinds of chores. I think I told you that my father built a house in an abandoned gravel pit. When my brother and I were bad, our job was to cart topsoil in a wagon from the field, which was a couple hundred feet down the road, up to the front of the house so we could make a lawn. Well it didn't take much for Pop to decide when we needed to haul twenty wheelbarrows of dirt! And when you are seven or eight years old, that wagon is heavy.    Ms. Pomphrey: Dad was a disciplinarian.    Mr. Treiber: We had chickens, and a pig, and we had chores we had to do. We had to clean out the chicken house, feed the chickens, make sure they had water, and kick the pig so he wouldn't bother us. Another thing that Hank and I had to do was to cart water from the neighbor's because we had no well. We had to take two buckets and go get the water.    Ms. Higgins: Every day?    Mr. Treiber: Yes, whenever you wanted water.    Ms. Higgins: Every day for every water need?    Mr. Treiber: For all the water needs we had. Of course there weren't any inside toilets. And my poor mom, since she did the wash, we had to light a fire in the back yard with a double boiler. We'd have to carry water from the brook to dump in that double boiler so she could wash. She would punch the clothes down in the water and sit there and shave a shell of soap to make soap.      Charles Treiber, father to Mina and Russell, at age 3  Ms. Higgins: You didn't have to read Little House on the Prairie, it sounds like you were living it!    Mr. Treiber: It wasn't unique to our family.    Ms. Higgins: You aren't that old!    Mr. Treiber: No, we were little guys, then.    Ms. Higgins: There were a lot of changes after the War, I guess.    Mr. Treiber: But you know the unique thing is, across the field from us was a family named Spade. They had a cow, and they gave us milk. They shared their milk with us. As a matter of fact, I had to jump a brook to go over there. And they used to give me milk in a milking bucket. One time I just didn't make it across the brook, and it spilled everywhere. You know that was the biggest loss in that area, a bucket of milk!    Ms. Pomphrey: We used to walk to Cherel's for milk, too. We would buy it from him, but the Spade's would just give it to us.    Mr. Treiber: Hank and I used to kill the chickens and pick them. Only on Sunday did you have those. And I always remember that Mom never bought two or three pounds of chop meat at once. We went down and got a quarter pound of chop meat and made sure we got a piece of suet with it. And they mixed that in with macaroni or noodles, and you didn't eat the meat solely as a meat item. You ate it in and amongst something else. We ate a lot of tomatoes, potatoes, and whatever we had in our half-acre garden.    Ms. Higgins: Did you have chicken eggs?    Mr. Treiber: We had a lot of eggs. That's probably where I got my cholesterol count.    Ms. Higgins: Did you have a refrigerator?    Mr. Treiber: No, we had a window box with a piece of ice in it. You hung a sign in your window. I don't know if you are familiar with that. They had signs in different colors, and that meant the size of the piece of ice you needed. The iceman could look from the street.    Ms. Higgins: Really?    Mr. Treiber: A ten-cent piece was a yellow card, a quarter piece was a red card, etc. It was a color coded thing for the iceman.    Ms. Pomphrey: You really didn't have to go to the store a lot in those days. You had a bakery truck come around, and then the iceman. Especially in Belmar, where Grandma lived. They would come around almost every day. Your milk was delivered to your front door, and the vegetable truck would come around. The man would come ringing his bells, and you would go out and get what you needed. Every day you would get fresh things, you didn't have to go to the store as much and freeze things. I don't think they ever thought of freezing anything.    Mr. Treiber: I don't even remember eating a hot dog when I was a kid.    Ms. Pomphrey: No, we never had what they now consider "junk food." You just didn't have it. We had homemade jam and things like that.    Ms. Higgins: Did you go to Long Branch pier? Was that around then, or maybe Asbury Park?    Ms. Pomphrey: No. Those things weren't around then.    Mr. Treiber: We went to Asbury at Christmas time, Mina, but you might have been too young to remember this. We used to get on a trolley at Belmar and go to Asbury. It cost you like a nickel or so.    Ms. Higgins: I hear more and more about this trolley. They never should have let that trolley go!    Mr. Treiber: It used to run all the way to Sea Girt!    Ms. Higgins: And up to Campbell's Junction?    Mr. Treiber: No, that was a different one.    Ms. Higgins: Yes, but you could all connect.    Mr. Treiber: Yes, because it went to Allenhurst, where the Jersey Central is now. That was the turnaround for that run. But anyhow, that was a big thrill at Christmas to go there because Newberry's and Woolworth's,  the five-and-ten stores, were both in Asbury,    Ms. Pomphrey: Dilwick?    Mr. Treiber: No, the one between Asbury and Ocean Grove. Fletcher Lake, isn't it?    Ms. Pomphrey: Yes, I think it is Fletcher Lake. After Daddy got a car, on Sunday we would go down and pick Grandma up. And we would go for a ride. I'm sure it wasn't far, but there would be people along the street selling hot peanuts. And that was big treat! Grandma would stop and get us a bag or peanuts. Were they peanuts, Russ, or chestnuts?    Mr. Treiber: Chestnuts.    Ms. Pomphrey: But they were hot, and it was a big treat to go for that little ride. He would find a hill.    Mr. Treiber: He used to say, "We got an extra fifty cents this week, so we'll go for a ride this Sunday."    Ms. Pomphrey: Right. And he'd find a hill to go down, and he would step on it real fast when we went over it. And that was a big thrill to us! (Laughter) We didn't have fast wheels and things. But we have great memories.    Mr. Treiber: I thought of another big chore that my brother Hank and I had. We would bring down the wood. We didn't have any coal or anything else, just wood. And that was our job, to get wood.    Ms. Higgins: This was your only source for heating and for cooking?    Ms. Pomphrey: And for hot water, if you wanted it.    Mr. Treiber: Yes, it was for everything. We had one stove...the kitchen stove is all we had. But the hardest chore, as I said, was getting the water. We had to go across the street, up the hill, pump the water out there, and then carry it home. And it would be slopping all over your legs in the cold weather.    Ms. Higgins: Whose  well was it?      Skippy and Buddy Treiber  Mr. Treiber: Our neighbor, Herman.    Ms. Higgins: And there was no water problem, he just let you do that?    Mr. Treiber: They shared with us.    Ms. Pomphrey: We finally did get our own well.    Mr. Treiber: But not in our time. Skippy and Buddy had one.    Ms. Pomphrey: Yes, we had one by the time our younger brother and sister were around.    Mr. Treiber: You know what a point is, I guess. It drives a pipe down with a point on the end of it, and that's what they used to hook the pump to. We would drive one of them down and within a month, it would all fill in with quicksand. And it would clog the point.    Ms. Higgins: That's the sand and gravel kind of soil, sure!    Mr. Treiber: Yeah, that's why they had Wall Wash, Sand & Gravel.    Ms. Pomphrey: Years ago you did hear a lot about quicksand. But I don't hear about it now, do you? You would have to be careful where you walked because you could go down in the quicksand.    Mr. Treiber: There's still some.    Ms. Higgins: Maybe when you left Wall, you didn't hear about it as much.    Ms. Pomphrey: Right, gave up some good country. (Laughter) Then they had sidewalks.    Mr. Treiber: Another thing in Wall that a lot of people don't know is that we were very aware of the Indian artifacts when we were children. And all the farmers had cans or boxes full of arrowheads and axes. All across the ridge there, all the way from Manasquan up to Sand Hill in Neptune, it was all Indian country. They used to call that one area there Indian Field.  And we knew that, and we were very aware of looking for axes and artifacts, etc.    Ms. Pomphrey: What about the horses? I can remember horses riding around.    Mr. Treiber: There is something. Early one spring we woke up, and we  heard clippity-clop, clippity-clop. We looked out and saw 100-200 horses with soldiers on them going by the house. It was the 112th Field Artillery from Newark, and they were on their summer maneuvers out of Sea Girt. The 112th Field Artillery was an old National Guard outfit.    Ms. Higgins: And you could actually see them?    Mr. Treiber: Well, they went right by the house! Wall Township was used for maneuvers in those days.    Ms. Pomphrey: Yes, that's what I remember. I remember them running through the field.    Mr. Treiber: Oh, yes, and they were shooting at one other.    Ms. Higgins: It must have been a little hard on the potatoes.    Ms. Pomphrey: Well, that wasn't our field. They wouldn't dare smash my potatoes.    Mr. Treiber: And there was another source of money. It was hot, you know, in July and August. And these guys would give us like twenty canteens and tell us to fill them up for them.    Ms. Higgins: The soldiers?    Mr. Treiber: Yes. Hank and I would go down to the brook and fill up their canteens. And they would give us maybe a quarter, and we had an arm full of canteens. And then we were allowed to  pick up the blank cartridges, you know, when they were done shooting at each other.    Ms. Pomphrey: I remember that.    Mr. Treiber: We picked up those brass cartridges.    Ms. Higgins: The casings were valuable, weren't they? Was there a market for that? Would sell the brass casings back to the Army?    Mr. Treiber: No, we would sell them to the junkman. That was another thing. The junkman always came up the road with his bells ringing. And all of us kids were in the junk business. We would save rags, paper, metal, and all kinds of stuff. As a matter of fact, we used to dig it. That was one of our jobs to go in somebody's dump and dig up whatever we could salvage.    Ms. Higgins: Like automatic recycling. You sold it back to the junkman, who obviously sold it to someone to do something with.    Mr. Treiber: Yes, absolutely. It was down on 18th Avenue, because,  you see, there wasn't any Route 35 or 34 when I was a kid. They put those in when I was ten years old or so. But we used to go down that long hill they called Crossway Hill, and it goes by Burger King and Shop Right now. But the highway wasn't there, and that was our sleigh-riding hill. And we used to go down that hill, and we would go 500 yards or so.    Ms. Pomphrey: That was a big hill.    Mr. Treiber: Then there was always some nut, like my father, who had an old car. And he would be down there with a rope attached to it, and we'd all hang on the rope as he sped back up the hill. He would tow us all back up the hill again.    Ms. Higgins: That's nice!    Mr. Treiber: Oh, we had a ball.    Ms. Pomphrey: There wasn't that much traffic in those days. You had a car every half-hour, maybe.    Mr. Treiber: The highway wasn't even there.    Ms. Pomphrey: No, there wasn't any highway, so you could do things like that.    Mr. Treiber: And there was a dumpster on 18th, and we used to go down there. And I remember Pop found parts for a cultivator, and we made our own cultivator.    Ms. Pomphrey: Right!    Mr. Treiber: Over a period of time, we got enough parts to put together a bike for my brother Hank.    Ms. Pomphrey: Oh, a new bike was unheard of!    Mr. Treiber: No, we never had a new bike.    Ms. Pomphrey: One of my memories is about shoes. Sometimes your shoes would have holes, and maybe Daddy or Mom would put cardboard in them. But we had play shoes and school shoes. And then the Sunday shoes would become our school shoes, and our school shoes became our play shoes. But you didn't have ten or twenty pair of shoes, you just had enough.    Mr. Treiber: I used to get mine from Jack Wooly when he was done with them. I used to tell Jack to take it easy on his shoes because they were going to be mine next! (Laughter)    Ms. Higgins: Who is Jack Wooly?    Mr. Treiber: He was a friend of ours that lived in the town. His father was a Councilman, so he had new shoes.    Ms. Higgins: Did you speak just English in your home? Was there any German spoken?    Mr. Treiber: No. My grandmother would speak German if she got mad at you.    Ms. Pomphrey: She used to call me a "dopnikoll" which means clumsy, and I used to fall over everything. And I still do. She was a very sweet person. She lived in Belmar and rented her bungalows and home out during the summer.    Mr. Treiber: My grand pop was the first employee that Don Sterner hired when he opened the lumber yard in Belmar.    Ms. Pomphrey: The Sterner Lumber, yes.    Ms. Higgins: And this was her husband, right?    Ms. Pomphrey: Yes. He died very young.    Mr. Treiber: He died of an infection.    Ms. Pomphrey: We are just now finding out a lot of nice things about our family. They're things that we should have probably been checking into a long time ago. But at our age, you start looking back, and you want memories. And we have got a lot of good memories.    Ms. Higgins: What would you do on long winter evenings in the family?    Ms. Pomphrey: Not much.    Mr. Treiber: Go to bed and keep warm.    Ms. Pomphrey: Yes.    Mr. Treiber: You and Skippy were in your own bed. You had a bed, and my brother and I had a bed.    Ms. Pomphrey: And then Buddy came along.    Mr. Treiber: My little brother messed up the count there! (Laughter) But like I said, the only heat you had was the kitchen stove. And we would take turns sitting up hours at a time to keep the fire going in really cold weather. Hank and I used to put very little wood on, because we were the ones that had to get the wood. But my father was very generous with the wood.    Ms. Pomphrey: You couldn't read because of the lights. So we just used to entertain ourselves, and we went to bed early then. Once in later years, when our mother was no longer there, my sister was having a birthday party, and   Dad made her come in and go to bed, because it was her bedtime. And the children at the birthday party were still outside! (Llaughter)    Mr. Treiber: He put you to bed at eight o'clock, whether it was dark or not.    Ms. Pomphrey: She told that story. I say he was a very strict disciplinarian, but also a very wonderful person. But he was strict. He didn't care what it was, you didn't go away from his rules and regulations.    Ms. Higgins: Do you have any advice that you might like to give the future generations as we go into a new millennium?    Ms. Pomphrey: Oh, just enjoy the simple things of life! Enjoy the outdoors, and look around you.    Mr. Treiber: I think my advice would be to talk to your senators and have them form a Depression and go back to it! Then you can enjoy life.      Mina Pomphrey (right) and her granddaughter, Lindsay  Ms. Pomphrey: Yes. Just make friends and keep them. And sometimes it is hard to  keep friends, but you have to work at it. The material things in life are not that important. In fact I just wrote my granddaughter, Lindsay, an e-mail the other day. I said yes, it is nice to be remembered, but material things do not make you happy. You have to realize that. And she thanked me! She e-mailed me back and thanked me for the information.  I thought that was cute. But I had to do it because sometimes they think presents have to be a big thing. It doesn't have to be a gold necklace, it can be a simple card or "Happy Birthday." That's what I was trying to get across to her.    Ms. Higgins: It is very easy for people to get caught up in all that.    Mr. Treiber: We knew as children that if Mom and Pop didn't have supper one day, I could go down to our neighbor's house. And she had six of her own kids. Or I could go to another neighbor to get milk. But if you try that now, somebody would call the cops and tell them there was a trespasser on their property! We don't look out for one another's children, and not even for our own. And it's pitiful! We had a home life, and we had a family. And as near as I could tell, in those days communications were scarce, but the family was "your people." If nobody else was around, they would be there for you. But not now, families aren't even home now. I just think they have too much.    Ms. Pomphrey: I agree with that, I really do.    Ms. Higgins: Did you notice a big change in life in Monmouth County with the War years?    Mr. Treiber: Oh, yes. Are you kidding? Most of the people I know quit when they were a sophomore or freshman in high school, and they joined the service. They volunteered!    Ms. Higgins: In 1941?    Mr. Treiber: Yes. They started drafting people in 1940. The people that were in the National Guard, the ones they used to train, they were gone. They were pulled into the service right away. But then they started asking for volunteers, and conscription started also. So we would volunteer as sophomores in high school so we could pick the service we wanted. It was a tremendous thing! All the industries were coming back to life, and you could get any job you wanted. My father was starting to make money, but he couldn't be home with the kids either. He was working for Fort Monmouth.    Ms. Higgins: Oh, did he work for Fort Monmouth?    Mr. Treiber: Yes. I also worked there, too. I joined the Marine Corps on my seventeenth birthday, or actually three months before. They told me to go back to school, and they would call me. But I didn't, and went to work at Fort Monmouth instead in 1942. And my father was already working there. So we waited and waited. You see, they tried not to send you overseas until you were eighteen years old. So they would hold off your recruit training until you were 17 1/2 or so. So you always had a few-month period to wait. But anyhow, we all went in. My father at that time was 35 years old, and he got a draft notice. Because he worked at Fort Monmouth at a critical job, he didn't have to go. But everyone in the neighborhood went in the service, that I know. If my memory serves me, there was only one person from New Bedford who lost his life in World War II.    Ms. Pomphrey: Well, Russ was a Marine, our brother Hank was in the Navy, our brother Buddy was in the Army, and then our cousin was in the Air Force. So it was very interesting when they all got together or you would hear from them. Of course Russ thought the Marines were the best, Hank thought the Navy was the best, and it went on and on.    Mr. Treiber: The interesting thing was that  when we went into the service, it was the first time for most of us to leave the County, probably. I went to New York on the train, and I thought I'd never find my way home again! But that's true, we had never been out of the area.    Ms. Pomphrey: But you appreciated that trip, I bet. You liked it probably.    Ms. Higgins: Where did you train?    Mr. Treiber: Parris Island. I had never been so far from home in all my life! Then a few months later, I was on a ship heading for England. Then I was up in Norway. And I didn't even know I was in one place until I looked at the map! I was up over the Arctic Circle! Spittsburg in Norway is past the Arctic Circle.    Ms. Higgins: With the Marines?    Mr. Treiber: Yes, I was on an aircraft carrier. We were with the British fleet, and we were looking for the German battleship, Scharnhorst, which was their biggest. She was birthed in Norway, and when our planes found it, then we took off. Aircraft carriers don't fight battleships, you know. So we took off north, and then the British fleet came in an engaged, and they sank it. But we went so far north that we ended up in Spittsburg. Then on the way home, we got a call telling us to stop in Russia and drop off our planes. We had eighty-nine planes on the carrier. So we gave them all but twelve, and we came home with just those aircraft for the sub patrol. And the Russians would not let us off that ship. They wouldn't even let us on the dock. I was very young, and I thought there was something wrong with those people.    Ms. Higgins: Good thing you couldn't speak Russian!    Mr. Treiber: These women were intimidating men. They were big broads with a machine gun over their shoulder, and they scowled at us. But we were friendly, you know, giving them all our planes! Gees, all we wanted to do was go and get some milk or something. There was a section of Route 38 then, but we called it Sterner's Highway in Wall Township. It ran between Route 35 and Route 34, east and west. The Army was installing radar equipment at Camp Evans, in Wall. So they had thousands of Army K52 Vans lined up side-by-side all the way up and down that highway. And they would pull these out and install radar, and then they would ship them to the port of embarkation to send them overseas. And that was probably the primary industry in Wall Township at that point. Also Wall has Diana Radar there, which is the first radar to bounce the signal off the moon. And that's still there yet. It's historical.    Ms. Higgins: What did you do at Fort Monmouth?    Mr. Treiber: I was a messenger.    Ms. Higgins: Almost everyone I have interviewed has worked at Fort Monmouth. That had quite an impact on this county.    Ms. Pomphrey: How about Camp Evans? That is now a museum.    Ms. Higgins:  With what you know about all this, Russ, you might want to consider working with them. There is a man named Fred Carl.    Mr. Treiber: I told you before that we knew as children about the Indian impact on our area. Well they just dug up some Indian bones at Camp Evans. And they have had to write to all the Indian tribes and ask them what they want to do with these bones. And I thought they had already done what they wanted, they buried them and thought they would stay there for eternity. And here they are digging them up and then asking them what they wanted!    Ms. Higgins: That's a very interesting point!    Mr. Treiber: They have a project they have held up, and it's very plain to see they had to stop when they found these bones.    Ms. Pomphrey: That's a project at Camp Evans.    Mr. Treiber: And that's all in the woods at Shark River. We knew  as kids that it was Indian country. We used to go out there, scratch the ground, and find an arrowhead.    Ms. Higgins: I was going to ask what you did with the arrowheads.    Mr. Treiber: I gave mine to Neptune Museum. I still have some at home that I found after that. There is another interesting thing. In the winter when I worked for the State of New Jersey, we couldn't work outside. So we used to go up and clean the storerooms under the Statehouse, and stuff like that. They have up there at least a hundred barrels full of Indian artifacts, just in the barrels in the basement. If you dig an arrowhead, they want to be notified right away, and they close the area off. Yet all they do with them is throw them in the barrels. Isn't it better for you to have them? Anyhow, this Camp Evans area now is where Marconi's first east-coast radio area was. He has one of the old towers that is still there.    Ms. Higgins: As children did you go over there and play or anything?    Mr. Treiber: No, that was far from home when we were kids.    Ms. Pomphrey: Yes, that would be far for us.    Mr. Treiber: Plus, I was scared to death of that Ku Klux Klan then. They had a terrible reputation when we were kids.    Ms. Higgins: I am shocked, I really am. I had heard rumors, but this is the first actual authentic statement I have heard about the Klan's activities in Wall.     Mr. Treiber: I could mention names, but...    Ms. Pomphrey: No, you don't want to do that, Russ.    Mr. Treiber: Most of them are gone now. I think there is one guy still around that was a member. There were international people that came, too. I would doubt that any of the local people would have beat up my father. But some of the big leaders would, because they didn't know him. But anyhow, he went to the defense of Jesse.    Ms. Higgins: What was your father's name?    Mr. Treiber: Charles.    Ms. Pomphrey: Charles Henry Treiber.    Ms. Higgins: Well, I want to thank you for coming today.     Ms. Pomphrey: Thank you for inviting us. 
MonmouthCounty;Philip May;1939;2000;Philip May, 1939, 2000    Remembering The 20th Century: An Oral History of Monmouth County   Mr. May with friends celebrating the last dinner on the Titanic Date of Interview: August 10, 2000  Name of Interviewer: Douglas Aumack  Premises of Interview: Mr. May's home, Ocean Grove, NJ  Birthdate of Subject: August 4, 1939  Mr. Aumack: How did you come to Monmouth County?  Mr. May: I was born in Long Branch in Monmouth County and I've lived here all my life, so that's how I came here.  Mr. Aumack: What hospital was it?  Mr. May: It was Hazard's Hospital, but is now Monmouth Medical Center.  Mr. Aumack: How small was that hospital?  Mr. May: I imagine it was quite small  of course I don't remember because I was small myself. But I know from my mother telling me that it was a small hospital and Dr. Hazard was in charge.  Mr. Aumack: How long was your family here before you were born, do you know?  Mr. May: My family goes back in Monmouth on the Covert side  the family home was in Wayside, and I don't know how many years they were there, but probably from the early 1800s. Maybe even before then. There's a Methodist Church on the hill in Wayside that seemed to be the church of all the farm families in the area and we're still there. I was just there with my sisters, up visiting the grave sites  her husband died not too long ago. But we're there, and it's interesting when you come from a small town like this and you've stayed in the area. I had a friend who I went to school with, who was a classmate of mine, and years later, I guess it was about thirty years later, I saw her. I had the Pine Tree hotel here in Ocean Grove, and she sought me out and said, "Do you know we're related?" Well it was that up on the hill in that cemetery, that she found out. I guess the families intermarried. But that's the one side of the family, how we got the connection with Ocean Grove here, where I am today. My great grandfather was a baker for West Point and he moved from West Point about the same time Ocean Grove was founded, and opened a bakery here. I don't know too much about the bakery, but I do remember my grandfather showing me pictures of himself as a little boy, on the streets of Ocean Grove with a goat cart, selling bread. And then my grandfather had a big horse drawn truck and it said "No flies on the bread, bury the name of Magathan." So he came down here and the rest is history. My mother was born here  my grandfather had married into the Coverts, the family out in Wayside, so we've been in this area ever since. We go back a long time here. Probably the Coverts side goes back a lot longer then the Magathan side. They came over before the Revolutionary War and they fought with Ethan Allen and the Green Mountain Boys. But the family member who came first eventually moved west with the land grants. They all moved to Kansas. That was a part of the family I never knew about. I just thought they came from Scotland with my great-grandfather coming over. One of the members of my family did research and found out most all of them are out in Kansas, including my great grandfather, who was born there. He worked at West Point and then came to Ocean Grove. So he didn't come from Scotland, he came by way of Kansas! I've never met the families out there. I have to go out some day. My cousin has been out.  Mr. Aumack: And this is the Magathans?  Mr. May: Yes, this is the Magathans. It was MacGathan when they came over, and of course they changed it when they entered the country to Magathan.  Mr. Aumack: So who went to West Point? What was his full name, do you know?  Mr. May: Yes, John Magathan.  Mr. Aumack: Do you know when he graduated from West Point?  Mr. May: He didn't go to West Point, he was the baker for West Point. I guess he had been in the baking business out in Kansas, and his family and he got this job in West Point. And then from there he moved to Ocean Grove and brought his four children with him. My grandfather was one of them.  Mr. Aumack: Now when he sold his bread, was it more door to door while having his store at the same time?  Mr. May: I'm not sure, I really don't know. I just remember seeing pictures of the old bakery truck, and my grandfather obviously went from door to door because he had the goat cart with the bread in it.  Mr. Aumack: So he first used a goat and then a horse?  Mr. May: Well, my great grandfather was the one that had the wagon. My grandfather was a little boy and he had the goat cart.  Mr. Aumack: Do you remember the name of the bakery?  Mr. May: No I don't. I remember seeing on the truck "No flies on the bread during the name of Magathan." It was kind of interesting.  Mr. Aumack: It was an advertisement as well as a sign.  Mr. May: Right. That was printed on the side of the truck. I don't know too much about this, my grandfather wasn't too into the history of the family, so what we learned was when somebody did research in Washington, DC.  Mr. Aumack: Now, what is your earliest memory of childhood growing up?    Mr. May at age six, after winning a contest  Mr. May: I was born in 1939, and I guess by the time I was two or three I remember my father went into the war. He was in the Navy, stationed in the Pacific. I had sisters. You met one of them, I guess when you came in, but they're ten years older than I am. And they're identical twins. My mother had the twins and then me ten years later, and I'd say I was about two or three years old when my father went into the service. So my earliest recollections are just being in that house, and the blackouts. You know during the war, when you're a little kid, you don't know why all the lights are out, and they pulled all the shades down, and so on and so forth. But we had the blackouts in case we were invaded or something, the invaders wouldn't see any targets of lights and so on. I do remember that we lived in Shrewsbury Township, which is now Tinton Falls. I remember the airport too, and that was neat, because there was an airport in Red Bank. In fact there's a restaurant called the Airport Inn on Shrewsbury Avenue and one of my earliest memories of the years we were on Peach Street and we could watch the planes taking off from the Red Bank airport. I remember just sitting on the porch and we used to have a little game guessing what color plane would come up next. That was kind of fun. But the dirt road and the open land, you know this wasn't farmland, it was open land across the street. I remember going to school in Tinton Falls. I remember kindergarten, because it was all day. You went all day and you had a naptime, you slept and so on. It wasn't like now when you go for two and a half hours and you go home. It was all day kindergarten. I was only in Tinton Falls in the school there for one year, and then we moved to Shrewsbury. My mother moved us there. She had a rough time of it because my father was gone and she had three kids, and the landlords wanted to either sell the house or use it for themselves, so we had to get out. She had to move the family herself and relocate in Shrewsbury.  Mr. Aumack: So your father passed away in the War?  Mr. May: No, no. But this move happened while he was stationed in the Pacific. Then when he got out, of course, he was able to do the things that needed to be done with this house that my mother had purchased. It was very rough, it was right at the end of the Depression, and then from the Depression we went right into the War.  Mr. Aumack: Why did you move to what is now Tinton Falls, from where were you, in Long Branch?  Mr. May: We didn't move in Long Branch. I was only born there. We lived in Eatontown.  Mr. Aumack: Why did you move from Eatontown to Tinton Falls?  Mr. May: Because the house was available. My mother was looking for a place to rent. We were there for a few years, and when that house was no longer available, then she had to make the move, and she had to make it without my father because he was in the service. We moved to Shrewsbury. I think they had that place for about forty years. I grew up in Shrewsbury. I moved there when I was five. We never moved again, and as I say, they lived there in the same house for about forty or more years.  Mr. Aumack: What types of planes were at this airport?  Mr. May: They weren't military planes. I don't remember too much because I was only about three or four years old, but I do remember the airport. I remember one incident. I guess I was always the kind of kid that got into things, and I just decided that I was going to fly an airplane. I was about four. Somehow I got into the airport, where the planes were, got up inside the plane, was in the cabin, and I was up there having a ball, waving to people. They were having to search for me, and they found me in the airplane. School busses took you to school and brought you home. I was only there one year, but my sisters were older, and I remember sometimes the bus would wrap around and stop near my grandparents in Eatontown. Now we were living on Peach Street off Shrewsbury Avenue there, what is now Tinton Falls, and there was a bar at the end, which is now a restaurant, the Airport Inn. The bus used to stop there, and now that I look back, I guess the bus driver just stopped there for a quick one after he did the rounds. But I had been with my sisters once or twice, and they went to my grandparents in Eatontown while he was bringing the bus back to where they parked it. So I told my mother, "Mom, I'm going away," and she said, "Where?" and I said, "I'm going to see my grand mom." And she said, "Have a good time," and said goodbye. Well, I got on the bus, had the bus driver convinced that that's where I was supposed to go, and if he hadn't stopped for a drink, I would have been at my grandmother's. My father and mother were just frantic, but I was up on the highway on the bus waving to her. She asked, "What are you doing in there?" And I said, "I told you I was going." I remember getting lost once in Red Bank. I was sitting on the curb, and I wasn't really upset, I was just frustrated because I didn't know where she was. A cop came over and said, "What are you doing here little boy?" and I said, "I lost my mother." So he made the search and found her. Then we moved to Shrewsbury, and most of my memories are from Shrewsbury.  Mr. Aumack: What's your fondest memory about Shrewsbury?    Mr. May at school in Shrewsbury  Mr. May: Shrewsbury? I was there from five until college, so I have a lot of memories of Shrewsbury. I remember in the fifth or sixth grade and having this teacher who was just wonderful. Everybody dreaded her. She had been there for years, and she had taught this one's father, and that one's grandfather, and so on, and she was very strict, but she turned out to be a real asset for me because she really got me on to school. Just that one person.  Mr. Aumack: Is that school still standing?  Mr. May: Unfortunately, no. That school was a wonderful, wonderful school, it was built in 1908 and its façade was wonderful. It was a beautiful classic school. Mind you, after I left Shrewsbury, I went on to college, and I taught at Little Silver, and I'm very much interested in the teaching profession and am very involved in it. If I had stayed in Shrewsbury, I probably would have gotten more involved in saving the school, because the people in the community came up to vote in Shrewsbury two or three times. The people voted not to take the school down, but the board wanted to expand, so it went ahead and got permission from the state to level against the wishes of the community. So I mean it was unfortunate historically, because the piece of architecture was beautiful. My twin sisters were a big part of my life because they were ten years old when I was born, and I became like the living toy to them, and so they were always interested in what happened to me, and what I did, and so on and so forth.  Mr. Aumack: They were two babysitters and two guardians.  Mr. May: Right, but it's a different experience when they're identical twins because the two of them are just -  Mr. Aumack: What makes them so -  Mr. May: So unique? Well, they're so much alike and they're so different. So close, yet they wanted to be independent. They were the kind of twins that didn't want to be exactly like the other one and dress like the other one, and so on, looking for their independence. Boy, they used to tease me. My family name was Buddy - "Do you want to come here, Buddy? Come over here with me." And I'd go over there and the other would say, "Oh, you don't want me anymore." You know, then they would drive me nuts, back and forth, back and forth. I think that just growing up with that has made it possible for me to deal with different factions, or to be aware not to neglect this one because I learned quite a lesson from them. I learned how to deal with the demands that are made on you from different sides. But they're both in Florida.  Mr. Aumack: Describe what it was like living in Shrewsbury.  Mr. May: I don't know what the class size is now, but in my graduating class I think there were only seventeen kids. Like everything, Shrewsbury grew, but it was just a nice environment to grow up in.  Mr. Aumack: Did a lot of people know everyone else?  Mr. May: In Shrewsbury? Yes, and I was rather involved in a lot of things. I was in the Boy Scouts, and I was in different choral groups, and we put on plays. I remember this teacher in particular, Helen Lang, that I had, I don't know how she did it, but I had her for fifth grade when she had fifth and sixth. As a teacher, I know  having just one grade is difficult, but she had fifth and sixth. She was so organized she'd teach a lesson in fifth, and then she'd give you a reinforcement exercise, or whatever, to start on, then she'd go teach a lesson in sixth. We were in the same room. Two rows of fifth grade and two rows of sixth grade. And she'd go back and forth all day. And yet, with doing that, she'd still have time on every Friday for the combined class to have a talent show, or program. It wasn't like it was a special one, but every Friday people would get up there who wanted to play their instrument, or they would form a singing group, or recite poetry. About an hour a week was set aside for that. And that was just wonderful. We didn't have any time in class to prepare for it, but we'd prepare after school. We had a singing group, three or four of us, and we'd get together and practice our songs to sing on Friday.  Mr. Aumack: How many kids did she have at once?  Mr. May: Well, as I say, there were probably about seventeen in my class, so she must have had thirty to thirty-five kids in two different grades.  Mr. Aumack: But they were all in the same room at the same time.  Mr. May: Yes, two or three rows of one, and two or three rows of the other. Just physically getting all those kids in was a problem. I don't know what the sixth grade was, I just remember what my class was, so maybe it was a smaller sixth grade. I know we had seventeen, so maybe they had thirteen, I don't know.  Mr. Aumack: It just boggles my mind how she would teach two classes at once. How did she do that?  Mr. May: Well, I know how to do it because it is my field. It's not easy. And she was really good at inspiring kids in that kind of environment  she really was good. There was a little penny candy store we used to stop at. It seemed like forever, but it was probably only three blocks in the other direction towards the Old Christ Church and the Allen House. And I remember the store was between school and the Allen House. I remember once in a while venturing up there for ice cream. Lovett's Nursery was just all fields, it wasn't a mall. Between Red Bank and the Old Christ church, going towards the place on the left hand side, there was Lovett's Nursery, which has been leveled now, and has housing developments on it. When I was a kid, it was all open fields.  Mr. Aumack: How has Shrewsbury changed?  Mr. May: Well, it's just become more populated, but it's still a very nice community. But having taught in Little Silver, I have ties there. Also, because of my involvement in the teaching profession, I represented the teachers from all over the county as the president of the Monmouth County Educational System. There were ten thousand members and about fifty or fifty-five locals. But Shrewsbury was very close to my heart because I grew up there. I never got very far, you see. I grew up in Shrewsbury, went to Red Bank High School, came back and taught at Little Silver  it's all within a couple miles. My whole growing up and business life was in that area. My ties are here in Ocean Grove because of family. My grandfather's sisters stayed here.  Mr. Aumack: Now after grammar school, where did you go to high school?    Mr. May in high school  Mr. May: We went to Red Bank High School. We were tuition students then, it wasn't regionalized. We were tuition students from Little Silver and Shrewsbury. It was a big change for us because we come from about seventeen kids in my class to a big high school setting. We used to catch the bus to the high school.  Mr. Aumack: How many people were in your graduating class?  Mr. May: From high school? About one hundred and eighty.  Mr. Aumack: How big were the classes?  Mr. May: In high school? It varied. The gym classes were always huge, but I don't remember class size being a problem, I don't remember being jamming in, so I would say the largest class was twenty-five or thirty students.  Mr. Aumack: When your mother or father wanted to go shopping for food or clothing, where would they go?  Mr. May: Red Bank was the closest. Even today, Red Bank has remained a lovely area. I went to high school there, and when we went to town, we went to Red Bank. There was the butcher shop there, there were different places there, and places to shop for clothing, and various other things you would need. However, I remember going about twice a month to Long Branch. Long Branch was a bigger city. Red Bank was small, and Long Branch at the time was a very nice city, and my mother would go there, two, three or four times a month to shop. But the big place was Asbury Park. That's why it breaks your heart just looking at it today, because it was just magnificent. Maybe once a month we would make the big time and we'd go to Steinbach's in Asbury Park, and Canadian Furs, and Tepper's, and all of the fine stores that were there. Interestingly enough, in later years when I was in college, I worked in Asbury Park. I worked there before, during, and after the riots, so I could really see what happened to Asbury Park. I was there at sort of a critical time. Just like really in Ocean Grove.  When I had the Pine Tree Inn, the hotel here in the Grove, it was before, during, and after the gates coming down and opening up Ocean Grove. But going back to where we shopped, Asbury was the big place.   Mr. Aumack: What kind of store was Tepper's?  Mr. May: Tepper's was sort of a gift shop, linens  it would be comparable to your bigger department stores only it was small, but it carried fine items.  Mr. Aumack: Do you remember when the roads were paved in Long Branch and Shrewsbury?  Mr. May: As far back as I remember, they were all paved. All the main roads, at least. In Shrewsbury, the house I grew up in was at 40 Laurel Street. Laurel Street went up to Thomas Avenue, I guess it was, but anyway it just ended, but then when they put in the development, they continued the road up. It was an all-wooded area when I grew up  it was just a road that went around like a rectangle with houses on it, and the rest was woods behind it, but of course it's all developed now.  Mr. Aumack: Did you ever use any public transportation to go anywhere?  Mr. May: All through high school. Because we were tuition students, we didn't have the yellow school bus pick us up. We got to the high school using a bus pass, so we used the public transportation for that.  Mr. Aumack: Do you remember what company was in charge of that?  Mr. May: I remember Borough Busses  it might have been that.  Mr. Aumack: Let's go back to Asbury Park. When did you start working there and what was your job?  Mr. May: I went to college in 1958 -  Mr. Aumack: What college was that?  Mr. May: Montclair State College. At that time I had two options: first of all, I came from a family where you felt loved, and it didn't matter what you did. So there wasn't the emphasis to succeed to be loved. It wasn't the push, and so on. I really had a very interesting life because I was free to do what I wanted. My mother and father just let me explore everything and anything that I wanted to do. My sisters were a big encouragement for that freedom, too. I know the sister you met here, Evelyn, used to say, "There's no such word as 'can't.' If you want to try it, just do it." So I grew up that way. I'd always thought I'd want to be a teacher, but I also thought that I'd like to go into business, and I didn't quite know which field to go in, and I wasn't under any pressure to go into either one of them. So I had applied to NYU to study retailing. In fact, there was a store in Red Bank which was a very fine men's clothing store then. It wasn't Roots, Roots came later, but it was J. Kridel's. Kridel's was the big clothing store. Kridel's had a scholarship and I got the scholarship. And as I said, I didn't have the pressure like, "Oh, you got a scholarship, so you have to go." But I did get the J. Kridel scholarship. It was four thousand dollars, a thousand dollars each year. Today that seems like nothing, but at that time one thousand dollars paid for a whole year at NYU. I remember thinking I would be probably living in the Village, and my expense would not be the college, because I had the thousand dollars, but it would be for the room and board. I'd have rent and so on. So I also applied to Montclair. Well, it was a state school at that time, and believe it or not, the tuition at Montclair was only ninety-six dollars a semester. So at Montclair, the whole year's tuition was less than two hundred dollars. But I decided to go to Montclair because I could go in for teaching, and I could also major in business. So I entered Montclair as a business major, with social business minor, and then went taking courses in education. I majored in accounting, so I could either venture out in accounting or into teaching of business. But that wasn't to be. My college career was from one thing to another.  Mr. Aumack: So you did a lot of exploring.  Mr. May: Oh, I certainly did. I had a speech class in my first semester as a freshman. The kids wanted me to be class president, well I turned that down, thank God. I turned that down, or I probably wouldn't have made it through the semester. But, I also had that speech class, and I really liked the speech class. Then the head of the Speech Department called me into his office and said, "Phil, we'd like you to be a speech major." Well, I really liked speech, although I never thought about going into that. It was dramatics and speech therapy. They wanted me to do the lead in the school play, Our Town. Well, I just felt that I should do some background work, I was the new kid on the block, and that should go to a junior or senior. So I turned it down, which is kind of weird when I think back on it. Most kids would say, "That's great," but as a freshman, that was my view on things. Also, I was rushed for three or four fraternities. It was like a madhouse. I went from the little town of Shrewsbury and the hardest to get into fraternities thought they were the top dogs and so on. I finally joined a service fraternity in college. So I was in a fraternity during my first semester. I should have just broken away and become a speech major. But I just had this idea that I would always have business as an ace in the hole. So then I was trying to complete two majors, and then with social business minor, you had to minor in business also. So I was going to school in the summers for that, and I got to the middle of my junior year and decided that I really wanted to go into speech. The Speech Department had been after me. Well, then they had a problem within Montclair, in the departments. The Business Department didn't want to let me go. I thought it would be an easy transition, and it would have been as a freshman. The head of the Speech Department was delighted that I was making this change, because he had been hoping that I would do that all along. When the business department found out about it, well, they were at each other's throats over what department I was going to go in, and I remember the Speech Department head calling me in and saying, "Phil, we'll help you get into any college in the country in speech, but there's so many problems here within Montclair with the departments that we can't take you." So I thought well, they're not going to do that to me, I've always been independent.  I also had an art class. Now I never had any art background at all, whatsoever. Shrewsbury did have an art teacher, but the program was very limited. In high school, I never had a thing in art. At Montclair, I had this art appreciation course which I really liked. The head of the department was Dr. Calcia. I thought they're not going to make me stay in a department, so I went to the head of the Art Department and I said, "What could I do to become an art major?" She asked for the background  I said I had none. So I was like an experiment, because I was fresh and new, with no preconceived ideas of what should be done. She couldn't believe it. She said, "All I can tell you is, if you're in the middle of your junior year and you're willing to switch majors into a major you know nothing about, then I will accept you into the department." The next semester I didn't register for business classes. I was not a speech major. So as far as I was concerned, I wasn't any major. When I talked to the head of the Art Department, I told one of those little white lies. I said I didn't have a major. I finally got through to the Dean and I told him that I didn't have any major and he said, "But you've been here for two and a half years. Nobody goes here with two and a half years without declaring a major." And I said, "I don't have any major right now, but I want to be an art major, and Dr. Calcia will take me into the art department." And he said, "Well, you've got to get a major. So, if she's agreeable we'll just send you to the Art Department." So I became an art major. I had to make up three years of all of the classes, and in art you had to minor in art as well. So I had all these art classes. It was a whole different field. Then the head of the Business Department found I hadn't been coming to class. Well, I didn't have any business classes. He said, "I haven't seen you in class." And I said, "No, I'm not a business major anymore." And he said, "What do you think, the Speech Department will have you?" And I said, "No, I'm an art major." He sat down and said, "I don't want you to go, you'll be a wonderful business teacher, and I think you'll be great." And I said," Why didn't you talk to me about this before? It's too late, I'm an art major, but I'll continue as a business minor." But he didn't want that, it was either all or nothing. So I finally graduated with about five and a half years of credits, from speech to business, and finally majoring and minoring in art, and my first job was in Wall Township as an art supervisor. I had sixty-five teachers working under me, and I was the new kid on the block just entering the teaching profession. And I worked with kids, also. I did demonstration lessons and worked with them on follow-ups.  Mr. Aumack: So what was your degree as?  Mr. May: Well, it was an art major with a business and speech minor. I can teach business and speech from seven to twelve, and art K to twelve. My first job was as an art supervisor, but I really love teaching. And I love working with the kids, and not just doing demonstration lessons. I decided I wanted a class for myself. So I applied for jobs in elementary education, but even with all those credits, I didn't have elementary certification. But I got a job in Bergen County, in Glenn Rock, one of the best schools in the state. I taught in Glenn Rock for two or three years, even though they said you'll never get into Glenn Rock because there was such a wait line and it's such a wonderful system. You'll never get in there. And I didn't have certification. With all certification I had, I didn't have elementary certification. But they were extremely professional. They didn't just look at credentials, and so on and so forth, they interviewed me, and then they came down and they watched me teach, and not only the principal, but the curriculum coordinator, and so on. They paid Wall Township for the day for me to come up to look at their system so that I would make sure that I was making the right decision. They took me around the district, introduced me to the superintendent, took me out to lunch, and had an extremely professional way of handling it. And even without certification I got the job. But I had to get elementary certification, which I did. I was there two years, but when you get the sand in your shoes, you just can't leave the shore, and I just wanted to come home. They were so delighted with me. I'll never forget they called me in to the office. There was the superintendent, the principal, and the curriculum coordinator. Although I'd taught there only two, maybe three years, they offered me the job of principal. This was before there were contracts for teachers. They could do what they wanted, and offer the salaries that they wanted. But they called me in and said that they were offering me the job of principal. They were offering me the job of principal of their junior high, and they would pay for all of my masters degree for certification in administration. They groomed you for the position, it was like a picture book, the way they ran that system. The current principal was leaving in two years, and I would take over the school in two years. I was flattered. And it's funny how some things you remember. I remember saying to them, "You know, I don't want you to feel that I'm ungrateful, but I got in this business to teach, and I don't want to leave the classroom." It was such an emotional thing to be offered this position with all expenses paid, and then to turn it down, but I had said when I leave, I'll leave the classroom. And I did. I left there in a year and I came back home. Then I taught in a ghetto school for three years.  Mr. Aumack: What do you mean a ghetto school?  Mr. May: Well, I couldn't understand why I wasn't getting calls, because there was a teacher shortage then, but I wasn't getting calls from the districts that I applied to down here. I didn't plan to go back to Glenn Rock. I told them that I loved teaching and I called the borough, and they said, "What grade level are you interested in?" And I said, "Do you have anything available?" And they said, "Yes, but what grade?" They said, "We can't find your application, but why don't you come in for an interview?" I went in. Dr. Clausen was the superintendent  he was one of the best that I've worked with, and I've worked with the lot, the good, bad, and the ugly. But he was there, and he interviewed me, and he offered me the job. I was delighted now that I had a job here. What I didn't realize then was that I wasn't in Freehold Township, I was in the Boro, and I was in the ghetto school that has since been torn down. It was built in 1865 Hudson Street school in Freehold  the new addition went up in 1916. And to join those two additions was a hallway. The place leaked  it had horrible conditions. I had left Glenn Rock, which was Utopia, our playground was by Nabisco, you had the smell of the fresh cookies and so on, we had a huge playground to play in. On my first day of school in Freehold, they didn't even tell me where my room was. I asked the teachers where my room was. I had no room. I wound up teaching in the hall that joined the two schools. Then I looked out the window in the back, and I said, "Where's the playground?" They said, "You're looking at it  it used to be a mudhole." They had blacktopped it over. They were three unbelievable years. I probably would have stayed there, because I love teaching kids, but the board administration was so corrupt in that district at that time, it was incredible. The man who had hired me went on to Basking Ridge, and he was only there one or two years, and then they hired someone who was just a hatchet man to get rid of the teachers there. That was where I became involved with teaching leadership.  Mr. Aumack: When did you come to Freehold Boro school?  Mr. May: About 1968. In 1968 a law was passed that teachers could negotiate contracts  before that time, they didn't. And I was in my third year of teaching, I was not tenured, and I wasn't really involved with the profession. I don't know why, but they asked me if I would write the original contract there, and another teacher and I sat down and wrote it. It was sixty some pages. And with that, I was offered another principalship in the sleaziest manner possible in Freehold Boro. The superintendent who was there at that time, came to my area. I had tried to make the room look nice, but it had these huge ceilings that leaked water down the blackboard. I brought in all kinds of flowers and plants, and had them in the back windows. I was teaching the kids when he came and said he wanted to talk to me. He said he had heard about my working on this contract. I wasn't presenting it or anything, I was just writing it. And he told me, "Obviously you're a teacher leader in this district." Well, I never thought of myself as a leader there, I was just writing this contract. And he said, "I want you to know you have it made in this district and if you play it my way." And I said, "What do you mean?" And he said, "I have a principalship coming up that you can have, but you've got to get rid of that contract." So in other words, you screw the teachers and then you've got a principalship. That was basically his offer. I blew up. I said, "I can't believe your offer." I almost threw him out and he was the superintendent. He said, "You'll do it my way or else." I said, "I'll take the or else because I'll be damned if I do it your way. I can't believe you'd even suggest something like that to me." I knew it was over. And I hadn't taught too many years or in too many places. But I had teachers come to bat to help me. One was having a really good second year, and he really appreciated the work. I said, "You keep your mouth shut, you'll only get yourself in trouble trying to stand up for me and the others too." I was fired from that district, but I made them fire me. Because I had three years of teaching, I would not sell out, and so I knew the gig was up. He called me in to talk, I remember it was at lunchtime. I had to go into his office, and he said, "There's no reason to give you a contract because you don't plan to stay with us." I said, "Oh, but there is." And he said, "Why?" And I said, "Because I deserve one. I've worked damn hard in this district for three years with these kids and gone over and above board. I deserve a contract." Then all of a sudden he began to find fault with my teaching. I said, "What's wrong with my teaching?" He said, "Well, for instance the way you teach reading." I said, "What don't you like about the way I teach reading?" The year before he had offered me the reading specialist position in the district, but I happened to be in Europe at the time, and they needed to hire somebody immediately. I knew that, he had told me that. They were just making things up to find a reason not to give me a contract. I said, "Look, in your position, you can take the best teacher and make him look rotten." And he said, "You know that." I said, "I know that, and you know that too." Well, in his office, he got so angry with me that he jumped up and took off and left me sitting in his office. So then I forced him: if he didn't give me a contract, he had to fire me. So he fired me, and I went to the New Jersey Education Association for assistance. I had applied to five districts, and I know every one of them today, because contracts was such a sensitive issue at that time. But what he was doing was union busting, and it had nothing to do with New Jersey Education Association, it had to do with labor unions. It was kind of like 1916, when leaders of the union were fired, and therefore the union had little power. But I had the teacher's rights fund at my disposal to sue them. And NJEA worked very closely with me, and we were doing it. If he did this to me, he'd be doing it to other teachers, so I figured I wasn't going to let that happen. In the meantime, I applied to five different districts. I had gotten five contracts in those districts even though he was blackballing me. In fact, the principal in Little Silver sat down with me, and was telling me what went on behind the scenes. They wanted to hire me immediately in Little Silver, but I had been blackballed by the Freehold superintendent. And this superintendent didn't know how he was going to get my appointment through the board, and he didn't want me to sign somewhere else. So he sent the principal to Basking Ridge. Remember I told you the superintendent at Basking Ridge was really good? The principal went up there under the guise that the Little Silver school was looking into the math program at Basking Ridge. So then, just casually, he said, "By the way, we had this candidate come in, Phil May. What do you think of him?" He said, "Let me tell you, Basking Ridge being the kind of district it is, I don't have any openings here. But if he were to come in here for a job, I'd find one." So the principal got on the phone, called, and I got the contract in Little Silver. I got a contract in all five districts. I don't know how I got the contracts, because when they interviewed me, they asked the questions. I said, "Are you finished? Now, I have questions for you. I don't want you to think I'm smart or putting you on, but I'm in one of the worst teaching situations I could ever possibly be in, and I will never be in another one."  Well, then I really grilled them. I went on forever. "What kind of district do you have here, what kind of policy, etc." And even with that, I got contracts in all of them. I went to Little Silver, I grew up in Shrewsbury, so I went there. And that's where I spent the rest of my career, about twenty-five, thirty years there.  Mr. Aumack: In Little Silver?  Mr. May: In Little Silver.  Mr. Aumack: Is that school still standing there?  Mr. May: Oh, yes. I just retired a few years ago.  Mr. Aumack: What did you teach?    Mr. May teaching sixth grade  Mr. May: In fact, they didn't want me to retire, which was kind of nice. I taught sixth, seventh and eighth. Mostly sixth, and social studies, mostly, but I taught other things. But when I turned fifty-five, I retired. They wanted me to stay on to sixty-two at least. They said, "You're at the height of your career, you're in educational politics, on the top." I was involved with NJEA. I was on the committee that did the hiring and firing of NJEA people at the state level. I was one of the teacher representatives on that board. I had just put on two plays for the kids, Oliver one year, and Annie. And I loved the classes, I loved teaching them. They asked, "Why would you leave?" I said, "I have to leave sometime." And you really reach a point where you have so many other interests, not that I don't love teaching. I just had so many other interests. So I retired early.  Mr. Aumack: Are there any other stories that you can give me about the politics of education?  Mr. May: Yes. You've heard how I got involved in the politics of education through this superintendent, but I didn't learn my lesson, because when I got to Little Silver, Little Silver had no contract, and they had said they would never have a contract because it's just not the way to do things. Now you don't work without a contract. But then having a contract was considered terrible and unprofessional. In other words, you take what the board gives you. So I guess I had just gotten on tenure, and they asked me to be on the negotiating committee. I'd never been on a negotiating committee, I'd just written a contract, but I knew that wasn't the way it was supposed to work. I went in there and there were three teachers. The teacher chairing it goes in to the superintendent with the agenda, and said, honest to God, it was like whispering, and the superintendent says, "This one I can take care of, that one might be a possibility, this one, no don't bring that up, it would only upset them, now this one I can take care of." And he'd go through and he'd cut out all things on he didn't want to address, and all you had were the things that were nothing things. And I thought, "I can't believe this." So we went through that year. The following year we had a strange set of circumstances. The superintendent died. One of the two principals in the district, and the one who was real aggressive, takes over like a superintendent, and he wants us to go in to him even though he is just the principal. They hadn't hired a superintendent, and he wanted us to go in with what we were proposing to him. And I wouldn't do it. First of all, he wasn't the superintendent. And so, I write up the original contract again. Sixty some pages again. Two other teachers were on that committee  I wasn't head of the negotiating committee, the other one was. I was dropping out if they didn't present a formal contract. We got right to the wire. We wrote the contract, had all the language, but we needed it typed up, and this was their out. Because they didn't have anybody to type it,  they weren't going to look at it. Well, I had a law secretary who was a friend of mine type the contract. Then I got in touch with NJEA. The head of negotiations said, "I really want to do this, but we just can't get it typed and get all the stuff done." That was her out. So I showed up that night with the representative from NJEA and the contract typed, and I said, "You're going to be delighted, I was able to get the contract typed, we have this and we're going in." The board didn't want to talk to us, they didn't even want to touch the contract. John Malloy, who represented us, stated, "It's just a contract, it's negotiated between the two of you, it's an agreement of working conditions, it's nothing to be afraid of, just look at what it says in the first page. Look what it says in the first page." I'm watching him, because I knew what he was doing. Well, they were curious, so they open it up. Well, once they opened it up, they were negotiating. We worked out the original contract, so I guess I negotiated the original contract there in Little Silver about twenty, twenty-one years ago. Then I was involved with the county and the state and even nationally in education politics, and in Little Silver, I could do negotiations or I could do grievances for Little Silver. They were afraid if I were president I'd have them out on strike. Things got really bad one year, really bad  the teachers didn't have an agreement, they didn't know what to do, so they came to me, saying "Would you take the presidency?" That was in June, and the following September we were out on strike. But we never had to do it again. It was one of those times when we just couldn't come to an agreement. They never thought the teachers in Little Silver would do such a thing. I told them we were doing it. I said, "We're not going to work without a contract, we're just not going to do it." I really feel that even through all that, I had the utmost respect from most of the board members, the administrators, and the superintendents.   Mr. Aumack: Why were they so against these contracts?  Mr. May: Because they were a threat. School boards, administrators, and superintendents could do whatever they wanted without them. In Glenn Rock, the first school I taught at, I was the fair-haired boy. They wanted me to be a principal. But if we had been under contract, you can't just single out one and send him or her for all this special treatment, paid classes and all. Contractual benefits in that area will pay up to maybe six credits a year. These things you have to negotiate in, you all have to agree. That's why they were against contracts -- because it's power. Without contracts you had nothing to say. They had full power over you and the district. But when you put it on an equal playing field, where the boards and the teachers hammer out a contract that's mutually agreed upon, it gives the teachers, or any organization, certain rights. Our big problem over the years has been not having the right to strike. We can strike, but the board can get an injunction to have us go back. So you have the right to strike, but you can't use it. And that's the bottom line, the board of education knows that and knows that the teachers are going to be like the first group in Freehold, that that situation in Freehold is what got me involved with county leadership. Those strikers got the worst sentences, I think, in the history of state educational politics. The teachers went on strike  it was a bitter strike, and they were going to make a lesson of those six, ten people, whatever it was, including the union president. He got six months in jail. I mean it's hard to believe just for not working. I went to college with one of the women, and that's what really got me involved personally. She was one of the negotiators and they threw the book at her. I don't know what they got, six weeks, whatever the term was, but just to make it more embarrassing, she had to have surgery while she was in jail. Well, when they took her from the county jail, they put her with the worst criminals, they took her from the county jail to the doctor in a paddy wagon, handcuffed. Not a nice scene. So she had the scars from that, and she always will. She was able to overcome a lot. And she wasn't the only one, they all got it. The men had it the easiest. They were allowed to teach the inmates. But the women, and this one particular one I went to school with, were not. She had had a big student, a Black girl, in one of her classes, and when she first had this student in class she was kind of scared of her, because this woman is small, and this young girl was big. She had had one child at thirteen or fourteen, another one at fifteen by an uncle, and she was tough. Well, when Lynn went to jail, they put her in a cell with this student. Lynn was petrified as to what would happen to her. But as it turned out, the girl happened to like Lynn, and saw that no one hurt her while she was in there. But it could have been the other way around. That was what they did. The right to strike is still an issue, because the boards can get an injunction, and if you continue to stay out you're subject to all sorts of fines, jail, and so on. So all the board has to do is hang on long enough, and drive you to the wall. You're not going to win. It's like boxing with one hand behind your back.  Mr. Aumack: All right, let's talk about Asbury Park.  Mr. May: Asbury Park? As a child growing up I went there to the amusements and to the business district. We went shopping in the business district, maybe once a month with my mother and father, if you could get him to come down and do some shopping. In the summer time, the boardwalk was unbelievable. My mother and father would bring us down there for fireworks, for the rides, or for whatever. Not for swimming  we always went to Seabright to swim because Seabright was the closest beach. But for the special boardwalk, Asbury Park was it. And the Monte Carlo pool. I mean they had the best of everything there in Asbury Park. Beautiful area, beautiful homes, well-kept, nice city, as far as stores and commercial area. But when I got into my first year of teaching, which was in Wall Township, I rented a house here in Ocean Grove. I had always had ties here in the Grove, but I was never here very much. I came to visit. But during my first year of teaching, I rented a house over on Embury Avenue, and was here for that year. I used to cross over the bridge to work. I used to walk to work, because the gift shop I had a job at was in Asbury, right across the street from Steinbachs. During that time the Monmouth Mall had opened up. The mall was the first thing that really dented the business district of Asbury Park. I remember Mom driving around and around forever, looking for a parking place, but when the mall opened up, you had all the parking you wanted, and also the big stores. So Asbury Park lost a tremendous amount of business when the mall opened. But what happened next really finished Asbury off, and that was the race riots. There was a sort of like ghetto type area here on Springwood Avenue. Lake Avenue goes into Springwood Avenue. There was a section there that had stores and so on, but they also had prostitution and drugs, and all kinds of things going on that street. I never really got beyond the first or second store, but I knew that those things were going on. Springwood Avenue goes into West Lake Avenue, too. At one time, they changed the name of it. But then they went back to the original, and I see as I went down that road a week or so ago, it's Springwood Avenue. But there were a lot of Black businesses as well as White, and most everything on that street was controlled by White slumlords. And they got all the money, and the area got the crime and corruption. So the African Americans who were there finally just had it up to here. There were riots all over the country in the 1970s. I was in the gift shop when the police came  it was like a police state, they'd come up, and one business after the other was leaving the area. This business that I worked for was started by German immigrants. The son was a friend of mine. He's in his eighties now, and he took over the business with a partner, and then I worked for them. So it was a business that had been in the family since the turn of the century. The police came in and told them to pull their window in every night. They had just taken over a week to put a window display in, and I remember they had this big beautiful American Eagle made in Italy. It was a Majolica type, it was gorgeous, and they had it on the turnstile, and the police come in after they had just finished and say there was a possibility of riots at any time and we suggest you pull your window in every night. It had taken them a week to put it in, and I remember the frustration of the owner: "We'll just have to take our chances, we're not pulling the window in." But after the riots, they moved out of town. I happened to have a friend of mine who was African American, and lived in Monroe Towers over here. The first and only time I went there for dinner happened to be the night of the big fire in Asbury Park. We were up high on Monroe Towers, which is one of the apartment buildings here, and we heard all this commotion and noise, and fire trucks, and we went out on his porch. He had a porch overlooking this. We literally watched them burn Springwood Avenue. I mean the fire started, and they tried to contain it before it got to Cookman Avenue, and they were able to, but it was just police, firemen, everywhere, and fires up and down the whole street, burning the whole place down. Black businesses and White businesses went, because once it started, everything went. So that was the demise of Asbury and now today I'm working with Asbury Park quite closely because Wesley Lake borders Asbury Park and Ocean Grove, it belongs to both. About five summers ago, it was an extremely hot summer, and nothing had been done to that lake since Asbury Park went downhill. There was no more commercial value to the swan boat, the rides, the merry-go-rounds  one by one, they just went. The lake itself has been abandoned. On a good day, the western end was about six inches. Usually it was a mud flat with garbage just strewn all over it, and this particular summer was so hot, it was just incredible. The pondweed with all the garbage collected in it, and the rats are swimming - it was just awful here. So I started a group. I decided I was doing something about it. I was going to run for Township Committee because none of the Township Committee wanted to do anything about it, so actually I did run for Township Committee, as an Independent, on my own, and both the Democrats and Republicans wanted me to get off that ticket. They were both afraid that I would win. Attention was paid to the lake. Not so much financial, but I got appointed to the West Lake Commission. I joined that in August. They met every three months, and I had about ten motions to make. I had my three friends with me that I had started this group with. It's called The Citizens for West Lake. Now there's about five hundred. In the beginning I brought all the ones I could get to the meeting. Now I was on the commission. I had ten motions: I made the first one that we meet every month because of the severe problems we have. They said they don't have any money. And I said, "You only meet when you have money? You're not going to get any money  you may as well as not meet at all." Well, they voted that down. Then we met at five thirty, and I said, "That's not a time to have a meeting when you're really serious about doing something, because people are eating at that time." I made a motion that we meet in the evening. Well, they voted that down. My third motion was that for the next meeting, we meet at the lake site, walk around the lake, and develop short and long-range plans. Well that was it. I couldn't even get a second to that one! The mayor was running, and he was from this area, and my friends said, "You don't even care?" Well, he said, "I'll second it." Well, they voted that all down, too. And then they called the meeting off. That was my first meeting. They met again in December, and none of them showed up in December. In January, guess who was left on the committee? Me. So I had seniority, and I was chair of the committee, and we had a whole new committee of the people from both towns and I've been working with the citizens for West Lake in that group ever since. While I was chair, I made the Citizens for West Lake a subcommittee of the West Lake Commission. And then I got out as head of the Citizens for West Lake, because I'm talking to myself being both chair of the Wesley Lake Commission and the head of citizens for Wesley Lake. I'm still involved with it, still on the executive board and I'm still on the commission. We've been very successful. We dredged the Western end of the lake. Once I got a call from the state saying that an anonymous donor had donated fifty thousand dollars, telling the state to call me and find out where I wanted it used. I don't know who the person was, but it must be somebody who knew me. And that money combined with state money gave us the funds to dredge the western end, so now instead of a mud flat, it is four feet deep. They still don't take proper care of it, we're still have to be on them, but at least it is four feet deep there now. And then we have the next step planned: fountains in the center here, and on the western end. And we're moving on that. My involvement in Asbury Park over the years has been working there, and going there for the amusements and the business center, and now working on the lake here which borders the two towns.  Mr. Aumack: So it seems that you made all this work towards saving one small part of Asbury Park, and it seems that no one wanted to help.  Mr. May: Not in the beginning they didn't. But once I got the new board, I was chair of the Wesley Lake Commission for two years. Then I worked to get Asbury Park involved, so my vice-chair was from Asbury. I wouldn't take the chair without the vice-chair being from Asbury Park, and I met with him every month. He didn't make many of the meetings, but he made a lot of contributions. I met with him, we did the agenda, we got to the point where we were going out to lunch doing the agenda. Then the head of public works in Asbury Park got on the board, and it was wonderful, so I dropped out as chair. He's been the chair of the West Lake Commission now for two years. The first year he wanted me to take it. And he even tried a fast one when I called for nominations, because I was chair and nobody was going to nominate anybody so I had to stay chair. I said this wasn't going to work. So I told him I'd be vice-chair, and now I'm a member at large on the committee. As a member at large, I wasn't appointed by Neptune, I was elected by Neptune and Asbury Park to be on the commission, which was nice. I like that because both groups were interested in my staying on. So there's been a lot of support, although originally it wasn't easy to come by. Nobody was interested.  Mr. Aumack: What do you think the difference was between the second go around as opposed to the first go around? Was it just different people or different times?  Mr. May: Different people. People make the difference. They're pushing their interest. I mean the first ones were waiting for the state to give them money and then they'd spend it, that was it. And state's not giving anything, federal government wasn't giving anything, so why meet? I hate to say it, but it was like the good old boy network: it looks good on your resume to be on the Wesley Lake Commission. But it has moved forward, and we've got a very active Citizens for West Lake group and the West Lake Commission has moved forward. Then I heard about a woman who was having trouble with Exxon, out by Dunkin' Doughnuts here on the corner of 33 and 35, because they had a station there that had a gas spill, and she was complaining about a cancer cluster and so on. Well, I didn't know what a plume is, I didn't know any of this environmental jargon, but anyway, plume is the direction that this leak has taken. The gas was moving towards the lowest level, which would be Wesley Lake. Well, it would take forever for it to get here, but it was nevertheless moving in that direction. She wanted it cleaned, so I teamed up with her and we had our first march. We called it the Plume to the Flume March. So we met over there, we marched from Exxon down here with a group of people  we marched to Founders Park in Ocean Grove, and that was kind of like the turning point. Then it became fashionable to defend the lake. The mayor of Neptune has a charity ball, and they pick a charity. Where does the money go? To the Citizens of West Lake - and we got about ten, twelve thousand dollars from that charity ball. And now people are still interested in what's happening to the lake.  Mr. Aumack: Let's go back to the race riots. Can you talk more about the causes?  Mr. May: I taught African American history for about twenty-five years. I got a federal grant when all this was going on. I started teaching in Freehold Boro in a ghetto school, and the majority of students, probably sixty to seventy percent, were African American. They had nothing in the way of African American History. There was no history, nothing for them. It wasn't like somebody told me they should be having a course in Black history, I just thought these kids should have it. I never had Black history in school, if they taught me any, I was probably daydreaming, but it would probably have been about George Washington Carver because he was a scientist and a great man, or Booker T. Washington. Booker T. Washington was a black leader who did what the white people wanted him to do. I'm not saying he was a sell out, because at that time he was able to accomplish a great deal for his people. But he had to agree that races should be segregated. He agreed with that. But I would get a book, it was called Proudly We Hail. I would read to the kids when we had a lull. I'd read about a famous Black person, and so on. Where I grew up it was all White in Shrewsbury. I taught to Little Silver, it was all White, too. Red Bank, where I went to high school, is mixed, so when we went to high school it was mixed. But we never had Black History in Shrewsbury, and I came from the same kind of district. And so I applied for a grant to teach Black History. I developed a ten week unit that I taught every year on African American history. You ask, what caused the race riots, there were many things, but it was simply that enough was enough. It was the right time and the right leadership. If you didn't have a Martin Luther King there leading and other people like him, then I don't know whether the Civil Rights movement would have taken off then. The segregation issue would have taken off eventually. It had been an issue for years, but it was like the right time, the right moment, the right leaders, to do this. President Harry S. Truman was the one who really started the idea of integration. During World War II , there were the Black units and the White units. The races were not even mixed in the military. But President Truman integrated the armed forces. As president of the United States he could do that. So that integration in the armed forces was a step. And then in 1954 the Brown vs. the Board of Education decision came out and was supposed to end segregation in schools. And meanwhile the right wing bigots were fighting integration in the military, fighting the school integration in all kinds of ways. Governor Wallace was trying to say we're not going to integrate the schools here in Alabama, but in 1963 the Civil Rights Act was passed and that ended the segregation in everything. It's interesting that all three branches were involved: one was a presidential decision, one was a Supreme Court decision, and the other was by vote of Congress. The Civil Rights Act passed. So you had all three branches working on this, but that didn't mean the people wanted to integrate. So then came the fight. You had the laws and the books, but then you had the fight for the integration. And that created the riots, and sit-ins, and wade ins. The beach between Asbury Park and in Ocean Grove is not a common beach. I think it belongs to Asbury, I'm not really quite sure, but there's a beach at the end of Wesley Lake, that was a "Black beach," that's where blacks could swim. But that's also where the sewers emptied into. With the civil rights movement there were many, many new ideas and laws, and of course, they triggered the riots. And you had the leadership. It wasn't just Martin Luther King. Black leadership started in the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s, but now it had the legislature and decisions, and the leadership to implement Civil Rights. That is the race riots as I see it.  Mr. Aumack: Was there a growth of African Americans moving into Asbury Park?  Mr. May: Blacks had been there for many years. Asbury was a very wealthy city, and it needed workers in the hotels and the homes and so on, and Blacks were there, just as they were in Glenn Rock in Bergen county. I wasn't even aware of that because it was not my neck of the woods. And in Red Bank, the same way, the Blacks were literally on the other side of the tracks. And I'm sure since then there has been an influx because as people move out, more move in, and the Blacks are in Asbury more and more.  Mr. Aumack: Let's talk about Ocean Grove. Tell us about the Pine Tree Inn.  Mr. May: In teaching it's not true that you get paid twelve months a year. You get paid ten, and you're unemployed for two. So you look for another job or spread your money out over twelve months. I had taught summer school and those things. I've always had ties here in Ocean Grove and I liked it enough that I really wanted to buy something here, but I had a home up in Tinton Falls on Sycamore Avenue. I thought it would be different to have a bread and breakfast rather than teaching summer school every year. I always like to try new things. So I thought I'd try a bed and breakfast see how that worked out. The Pine Tree Inn came up for sale and my partner and I purchased it, but I ran it during the summer. And I started the inn. The woman we bought it from had a dinner at the end of the season on Labor Day weekend. She invited my partner and me to meet the people who were there. One lady with her cane came over. She was ninety years old, and she said, "I hear you went to Montclair." And I said, "Yes, I did." And she said, "I went there, too." I said, "What year did you graduate?" And she said, "I graduated in 1911." I said, "1911  that was the first class!" She said, "Yes I was in the first class that graduated from Montclair." And it turns out that she and her two sisters were great nieces of President Cleveland. They were actually those three and their brother. But the brother didn't come with them. But one sister was ninety, one was eighty-eight, and the other was eighty-six. And the last time they came to the Inn they were about ninety-six, ninety-four, and ninety-two. And the brother was still alive in his late eighties. They were wonderful guests. I ran the hotel summers, then, because I love doing places over, I did the whole thing over, and, in fact the place was in Country Living after I finished it. I sold the place in Tinton Falls and I moved to the Pine Tree Inn. Now I was back living in the Grove again, always getting involved in things. I was on the Executive Board of the Historical Society at the time and I also had my real estate license in town, and I also had, since I had the hotel, membership to the Hotel Association. I was treasurer of the Hotel Association and in fact one of the founders of the Chamber of Commerce - founded the Chamber of Commerce in this town. I founded the Citizens of West Lake Group, too. So I had the Inn for about seven years, and the problem is, I'm not an absentee landlord and I had problems. I never had a break and was working fourteen months a year because in the fall I was starting the school year off and closing the hotel which is like double work, and in the spring I was opening up the hotel and closing out the school year. So it was like round the clock work. I wanted to make a private home out of it, but I thought so much of the guests I didn't really want to tell them they can't come anymore, so I sold the hotel and I moved to Interlaken. Interlaken is just a mile from Ocean Grove  it's on the other side of Asbury Park, a lovely community. But in many ways afterwards I wished I had kept the Pine Tree because the new owners were terrible, and the guests never came back again after they came back that year and left early. Interlaken was wonderful, but the Grove is really unique. It not only is a National Historic Site, it's between two lakes, Wesley Lake, that I'm on, and Fletcher Lake on the South end, and the Ocean to the east. So it's a very small area, about a half a square mile, but a tremendous amount of the work here is done by volunteers. There are many different volunteer groups in town. And when you come from this kind of environment and you go to Interlaken where everything is just wonderful but was also kind of boring compared to Ocean Grove, so I bought this beat up old house in Ocean Grove. I did it over, I furnished it, but I never lived in it, never even spent a night in it, but I had it on the Christmas house tour, etc. People used to call it my doll house. Eventually I sold it, and then this place came up for sale, and what I liked about this was the size of the property. Ocean Grove was like house, alleyway, house, and alleyway all very close. But this house had property, and it was a big house. I was just going to buy it  I still wasn't going to leave Interlaken, and I was just going to buy it, make some changes, and then resell it. Well, I got into it  I designed the whole thing, did the whole thing over, put in new ceilings, did the wallpaper, and everything, even the kitchen and the bathroom. And I moved in. I was no sooner back in the Grove when I was asked to take over the presidency of the Historical Society. And meanwhile I was president of my local in education. Local presidency of all the educational things is very difficult, because you're negotiating contracts, you're negotiating salary, doing some work with salaries, grievances, and so on and so forth. So I was president of the local, I was president of the county, and I had ten thousand members, and I was president of one or two other things, I had five other groups, and then they were asking me to be president of this historical society. I said, "Well, I want to know everything that happened since I left." Anyway, I took it. You could only serve a limited term, two years. Anyway, they changed the constitution and I've been the president ten years. And it's election year and I'm still trying to find somebody else to take it. But anyway, when I took it over, we were a little hole in the wall behind the bank over in town. The place took every bit of money we had to rent it, and we couldn't even put our stuff in it. We made a move here probably about five years ago. We moved into the Ocean Grove Camp Meeting Association lobby, because they had a CEO there who they had hired who was really good and interested in community involvement. They put out a notice to all the organizations that if they'd like to be a part of, or have a desk in the Ocean Grove Camp Meeting Association office so that they could work together on common issues. No one responded but me. I didn't want a desk and phone, I wanted the whole lobby plus a desk and a phone, and I got it. And then about four years ago, we bought a collection. We had to take the whole collection, and a lot of it had nothing to with Ocean Grove. It was Asbury Park stuff, Avon, you know, shore community things, but we had to buy the whole thing, and it was very expensive  it was around thirteen thousand dollars. And we had no place to store it, and really had no museum of our own. We were saving to buy a museum, and if we spent the money, we wouldn't have it for the museum. I had the deciding vote  it was nine to nine, so I had to break the tie, and I said, "Only if we buy it, we get rid of everything that has nothing to do with Ocean Grove." So we had an auction. Incidentally, that auction was the first of several. We just had our fourth annual auction last week. That first one was really a hoot because I did the auctioneering, and I had never done that. But we made twelve to thirteen thousand dollars. We made enough to pay for the whole collection and we have what we wanted out of it. If you go out past the auditorium, you'll see the historical society straight ahead of you. When the building came up for sale, it was a kite shop and filthy and run down. The basement was so littered with debris and garbage and busted bricks and dirt that they thought it was a dirt floor. It took six months to negotiate the deal, but we did. Then we didn't have any money to fix it up. We only had about three or four thousand dollars, and that was only enough to clean the rugs and paint and put all our stuff in. And the rugs were awful. So I put out an appeal to friends and members, and so on, to be a founder of the new museum. If they give twenty-five to ninety-nine dollars, they'd get on this list, and so on and so forth. And I was very fortunate, because the executive board voted that whatever money we got we could use it to put the museum together. So I didn't have to go back to them for each expenditure. Well, the money came in and although I had never done fundraising before, we took in about fifty thousand dollars. The museum now looks wonderful. Not only upstairs, but downstairs as well. We have a new cooling system, and a gallery. So that has been my involvement with the historical society. Now we're involved with the end of Main Avenue where there was a statue called the Angel of Victory statue that was put up in 1878 to commemorate the hundredth anniversary of the Battle of Monmouth. This was kind of interesting because the Civil War had just ended and Ocean Grove was only nine years old. The statue was ten feet and the base was eight feet. In 1922 it had troubles with the metals it was made of. The lead corroded within itself and it collapsed in a storm or something. So anyway, recreation of this statue is something that we'd like to. We can't restore it, but we'd like to recreate it. That's one of the main projects we're working on now. But as you can see, I'm very much involved with the town here. And what are some other questions that you have?  Mr. Aumack: What's happening in Ocean Grove now?  Mr. May: Well, Ocean Grove is really on an upswing. Maybe we should go back to when the gates were taken down. Ocean Grove was set up by the members of the Methodist Church, the Methodist Episcopal Church and it was an Ocean Grove Camp Meeting association. They purchased this tract of land here, and of course the religious laws went into effect. And Sunday was the day to worship so when it started out, no horse carriages were allowed in this town on Sunday. They had to be out of sight. Not only couldn't they be used, they had to be out of sight. So they had barns to put them in. Well, and then the same law was applied to anything with wheels, such as bicycles. You couldn't use anything with wheels. Of course when cars came in, cars had to be out of town on Sunday, too. It was really unique. When I had the hotel, it was hard to explain to somebody because it was like a whole community with cars that you can't see! Saturday nights I would take my guests over to Asbury Park to a parking garage where they'd park their cars. Then I'd bring them back, then I'd take my car over, park it, and I'd walk in. And from Saturday night at midnight to Sunday night at midnight there were no cars in this town. And no bicycles. A court case that came up that involved delivery of newspapers. The town had made a special exception for newspaper delivery vehicles to come in at four in the morning to deliver papers, and someone complained about it, saying they shouldn't be in here because they have cars. The courts were just waiting for that case to come up, and they threw the book at Ocean Grove, saying that everything they were doing was wrong from start to finish, violating separation of church and state, and that they can no longer keep vehicles out of Ocean Grove on Sundays, and that I could understand. But then they went so far as to assign us to Neptune, even though we were our own community here, run by the Ocean Grove Camp Meeting Association. Now the courts should have at least let us form our own community here. Instead they assigned us to Neptune and Ocean Grove became a part of Neptune. We had a big town meeting. I was new kid on the block then, because I had only had the Pine Tree Inn about a year, and I didn't know whether they'd run me out of the place or not, but I made the motion that we break away and form our own community here. And it passed overwhelmingly. Then we started the campaign with signatures, and the whole bit. Then we had another group that kind of undermined us here in town that was going to stay with Neptune, and thought Neptune was going to honor everything in the Grove. They weren't, though they said they were. So that issue was a whole historical controversy here. Eventually the property values went up after the town opened up. We didn't know what they'd do, but they went up. About ten years later, real estate in general plummeted, and in the Grove in particular they really went down. These old hotels became outpatient centers for slumlords who filled every room with people recovering from some mental or emotional disorder. The slumlords didn't take care of these people, didn't give them medication, and they'd wander the streets aimlessly. It was really a bad situation in the Grove. But now it's really on the upswing. We've gotten rid of most of those places that were abusing these people and just milking them for every penny that they could get from the state, and you'll see restoration going on all over town.  Mr. Aumack: What would you like to say to Monmouth County residents who are reading or hearing this recording?  Mr. May: Monmouth County has such a rich history. I would tell them that they should get involved in preserving the heritage that we have here. Right from the start of our country, we were at the crossroads of the Revolution. I would also say that New Jersey is one of the greatest states, too. I mean I'm retired now, and I'm thinking, "I could make a move," but every time I sit down to seriously think about it, I can't think of any place that would be better than New Jersey, and Monmouth County in particular. You're an hour from New York, you're an hour and a half from Philadelphia. You want to go to Boston, it's six hours, and you can make it in a day. Washington, D.C., if you left here at six in the morning you could be there by ten in the morning. You can go all over. I also do a lot of antique shows. And in this area here, you can go from North Jersey, South Jersey, you know, East, West, it's just a wonderful location for antiques, too. It's a state that people love to make fun of, but at the same time, New Jersey is one of the wealthiest states in the country. It is either the first or second wealthiest state in the country. And people love living here. You can make fun of it, but the statistics speak for themselves as far as what it has to offer.   Mr. Aumack: How has Ocean Grove changed, and how has Asbury Park changed?  Mr. May: Well, Asbury Park has really made a tremendous change. It went from one of the best boardwalks that we have in the state, probably second only to Atlantic City, really down. The Monte Carlo Pool was the largest salt-water pool in the world, and it no longer exists. And the business district, and the beautiful homes are decaying. I mean it is run down, completely run down. The lake here, which was so beautiful, I don't know where to begin over there. Asbury Park and Ocean Grove used to be called the Twin Cities, because they were founded by the same people. Ocean Grove was founded about ten years earlier. Because of its small size, the fact that the Ocean Grove Camp Meeting Association has never left has contributed to Ocean Grove's upswing. It was about twenty years ago that court decision came out. It was only twenty years ago that you had to have your cars out of here  we're not talking ancient history. The Ocean Grove Camp Meeting Association kept up the auditorium and their buildings. There is not an Ocean Grove police force, but there is a citizens patrol that was formed here. I'm on that too. Unfortunately I don't have much time to devote to it. And I wasn't one of the founders of it. But volunteers go out from nine at night until three in the morning in old police cars, called the Citizens Patrol, and they just drive in the streets. They can't arrest anybody, but if they see something going on, they can let the Neptune police know. The citizen's patrol was formed because we had so many problems years ago. We don't have as many as we did  but there were break ins, robberies, and so on. We also have a beautification committee, which does a lot of the work the township should be doing with our parks. They do the plantings and so on. The historical society takes care of the historical artifacts, and provides the museum for the town. The Fishing Club doesn't just concern itself with the fishing on the pier, they do community things, too. The Chamber of Commerce is involved with a lot of things. There's over twenty-five groups in this little town. The same people are on different groups, that's why you hear me saying I'm on this and that group. There is a crossover of people into different groups for different causes.  Mr. Aumack: I think that's a great place to stop, so thank you very much.  Mr. May: My pleasure.

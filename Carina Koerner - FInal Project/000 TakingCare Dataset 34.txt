TakingCare;Victoria Tenbusch;xxxx;2014;Taking Care--Documenting the Occupational Culture of Home Care Workers   Archie Green Fellows Project, 2014-2015   (AFC 2014/021: 01321)   Archive of Folk Culture, American Folklife Center, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.   Victoria Tenbusch interview, 2014-11-20 : interview conducted by Michael   Robert Bussel   INTERVIEW LOG  00:01:15: Name is Victoria Tenbusch. Previously worked in apple and pear orchards. Marries, then works in cannery for 13 years and is member of Teamsters union. Becomes certified nurse’s aide for 15 years. Retires, then has worked as home care worker for last year and one-half.  00:02:35: Light workload in home care. People do lots for themselves. Cleans house, does shopping, a little cooking. Provides companionship, visits with people who are alone. Currently cares for two people.  00:03:44: Upset at cannery and looks for other work. Sister-in-law had been a certified nurse’s aide and encouraged her to enter that line of work. Takes classes at local community college. Liked work in nursing home, most of it was good. Decides to retire, moving slower than younger people. Person she had cared for in nursing home sought her out as caregiver.  00:05:30: Caregiving more personal than other jobs. Must do things that people want you to do. People sometimes grouchy, but glad you are there.  00:06:15: People need compassion. They are the boss. Advantage to have been nurse’s aide previously. Learned other skills in home setting. Work is like taking care of your own home. Desire to help somebody else.  00:08:04: Talks about workday. Does dishes, makes bed, vacuums, or sweeps. Goes to store and shops. Returning items can be complicated. Likes it when person she cares for can accompany her on errands. Takes client to doctor’s office, bingo, or out on drives.  00:10:53: Clients consider her their best friend. Doesn’t want family relationship and tries to back off. Use tact to create distance. One lady took her to grandchildren’s home. Client also wants her to take her to parks or on picnics.  00:12:59: Does get emotionally involved with her clients. Misses them when they are in hospital. People talk to her about their families and their problems.  1    00:15:22: Talks with other caregivers about their jobs. Gets hints and ideas about how to handle certain situations. Not much shop talk compared to other jobs. Like taking care of your aunt or uncle in their home.  00:17:22: Lots of stress on job. Must do things exactly the way client wants. Sometimes people do not feel good, can be angry, emotional, or stressed. Negotiation when you work in someone else’s home. Can be fired by client, if they don’t like the way you are doing your job. Need to know how people you care for want things done.  00:19:05: Has taken care of several men. Took care of sister-in-law’s client when she was away. Got list of tasks and did them. Women can be more specific in telling you what they want done.  00:20:32: Having a sense of humor is important. Things come up that you just chuckle or laugh about. Caregivers don’t joke about work with other. Confidentiality limits joking about work.  00:22:24: Most gratifying part of work is getting out of the home. Likes visiting people and making sure they are okay.  00:22:46: Most challenging part of work is putting up with moods and mood changes. Has to listen to people who are in pain, brooding, say they wish they could die. Glad that people can stay in their homes. In nursing home, used to hear people say they wanted to be home.  00:25:01: Always believed in having a union. Able to give clients better service due to higher pay and receiving medical care. If she wasn’t making above the national average for wages for home care workers, probably would not be doing it.  00:26:45: Told story about job to state legislator. At SEIU Council meeting in Albany, shook hands with Jeff Merkley (Oregon US Senator). Need more resources for nursing homes. Some people in Salem don’t want unions. Recalls wearing purple with other union members in gallery at state capitol.  00:30:11: Union is us, not you. People don’t understand this. Union is not an outside force.  00:31: 10: No difference in caring for men or women. Men do not watch you as much as women do. Women are picky. Man says make it clean, make it nice. Women say how I want it folded, how I want it put away.  00:33:23: If they smoke, you come home smelling like a cigarette. Current clients do a lot for themselves.  2    00:36:17: People would be surprised to learn that you can have a lot of fun being a caregiver.  00:36:32: When not working, likes to do puzzles, work in garden, play computer games, read play pinochle, go walking.  00:38:20: Uses “client” to describe people she cares for. Doesn’t like the word “customer.” On a first name basis with all her clients.  3   
TakingCare;Terry Luther;1955;2015;Taking Care--Documenting the Occupational Culture of Home Care Workers  Archie Green Fellows Project, 2014-2015  (AFC 2014/021: 01881)  Archive of Folk Culture, American Folklife Center, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.

Born in Sacramento, California in 1955. 00:01:27: Other jobs: costumer theater company in California, started a theater company in Oregon, was a tree planter and hoedad in Eugene, Oregon in the late 1970s. 00:02:38: Caregiver at age 14. Had job at Roseburg, Oregon Veterans’ Hospital as librarian. Caregiver for her autistic son for last 24 years and paid for her caregiving for last two and one-half years. 00:03:32: Caregiving not different from other jobs. We are all caregivers when we open avenues for another human being. 00:04:14: Special skills: no judgments or preconceived notions. Happy people are able to let go of themselves and are able to serve. If you are happy, it is easier to be a caregiver. 00:06:00: Learned from her father who had polio. If you care and are nurturing, it is your calling. Went to institute for children with autism and took classes. Learned to let go of the outcome and just play. 00:07:31: Started her own program. People around her son didn’t like it. 00:08:24: On mission to teach people that we’re all the same. Everything is possible if you let go. In room with her son one-on-one for 90 days. 00:09:46: Taking my son out and integrating him one of best challenges I’ll ever have. 00:11:06: Son mimics what man did who yelled at him. No resistance...if her son lays on floor and screams, it is fine. Everyone learns. Truth teaches itself. Lets her son be. 1  00:12:39: Son asleep at midnight, up at 4:00 am, back to bed at 7:00 am, up later. Food, diet, cleaning, bed-making. 14 hours of constant activity. Must let go of my day. Logs 316 hours a month. “Sleep is overrated.” 00:14:20: Finds respites for herself: IPod, listens to music, takes nap, must take care of yourself. 20-60 tantrums a day at one point. Trips to Portland. What you give your child is right there. 00:15:59: Parents get lost, rely on drugs to deal with children. Holistic, naturopathic is her approach. If you take care of yourself, kids and family will be fine. Don’t be a victim. Ask for help. Caregivers will say they don’t need anything, they’re fine. 00:19:42: Does mentoring from Florence to Kenya. Potty training an issue for people she consulted with in Kenya. Common daily experience is non-existent. 00:22:04: Happiness is the key. Choose happiness and embrace it. Everybody can learn it. Need to create whole society of people saying “Rain Man.” 00:23:41: Most people look at disability as a life sentence. We are here to be happy and survive. 00:25:40: Stay present in moment. Most gratifying place you can ever be. Just my ego that thinks I have to do it all. Son went to restaurant in Coos Bay. Takes no drugs or medicine but is pure and authentic. Don’t need anything else. 00:28:17: Could change the world with autistic kids if we took the approach of being happy. Love what you got, got what you love. 00:30:36: Only challenge I face is myself. Need to be authentic. Challenges are self-fed. 00:32:05: Union got me on payroll. Had been only getting paid for two-three hours per day. Now getting paid for her work. Without union, she and her husband would be working until they are 80. Savings can now go into trust. Son has a future. Union has changed our lives. 00:33:50: Union liked her energy. She is a union delegate and runs local chapter. Has 12-14 people who call her. Union brings ability to share stories and our work. 00:36:07: ABC did documentary that featured her son’s story. Was once on radio station in New York, where she spoke about autism. Establishing eye contact is one tool. Beginning of significant change in our lives. 00:38:28: Son will teach anyone to “humble themselves.” Just do whatever it takes. 2  00:40:10: Took away all electronics when she started. Become isolated in caring for child with autism. At first was fighting to be with her son. Your child will tell you what they want. 00:42:58: To be a whole person, help someone else. 00:43:25: Parents killed by drunk driver when she was 24. Saw people coming back from Vietnam destroyed. Have to remind people what we are here for. 00:46:00: Makes wreaths with shells, collect glass floats, draws, paints, sings, play piano. Peeks with all these lenses. 00:49:55: Gratitude for sharing. What you do can make a difference. Cites case of Kenyan boy. One little thing at a time is success. 00:51:26: Wants people to know they should get rid of preconceived notions regarding autism and disability. Don’t judge. Please ask, don’t react. 00:54:13: End of interview. 3 
TakingCare;Terry Haydon;1943;2014;Taking Care--Documenting the Occupational Culture of Home Care Workers  Archie Green Fellows Project, 2014-2015  (AFC 2014/021: 01320)  Archive of Folk Culture, American Folklife Center, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.

Born in 1943 in Seattle, Washington. 00:01:10: Taught high school language arts and theater for 13 years. Sold insurance, moved to Oregon. Became medical transport driver. Met domestic partner and asked if he could become her caregiver. Has been full-time caregiver for last 14 years. 00:02:44: Always been a caring person. Got it from his mother. Natural fit to be a caregiver. Being live-in caregiver not for everyone. Down time away from home is limited. 00:04:20: Forces you to be focused and organized. Knew how to do this from previous jobs. 00:05:47: Must be caring person. Would “flag” a poor caregiver. Must be honest and sincere. Helps if you know how to organize your time. Has three good backup caregivers. 00:06:58: Initially against the union. Health insurance important. Became close friends with president of the union. 00:08:16: True caregiver thinks of client first. Can get worn down. Was in emergency room once for four days. Had good backup. 00:10:01: Introduced to caregiving through other caregiver. Mother raised three boys. Learned how to cook, sew, clean. Took classes in grooming. Yet to find poor curriculum or poor teaching. Home care commission training is top notch. 00:13:34: Talks about work day. Shower days are Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Requires another person to help with shower. Stretches Becky’s muscles first. Bags have to be emptied several times during night and covered in shower. Tries to encourage Becky to do as much as she can. Check for bruises, scrapes, and sores. Need to be observant of client and surroundings. Dry and dress her. About a three-hour process. Then lunch. Becky plays solitaire, watches 1  television. Gets chores done then. Does computer work. Fixes dinner. Then gets rest after dinner. Transfer Becky from wheelchair to bed. 00:24:08: Every fourth day must change base. Knows how to do it, but doesn’t like to. Catheter change must be done by home nurse. Tries to maintain routine. As artistic people, however, both fight routine. Importance of planning ahead. 00:27:48: Been on five cruises. Must plan way ahead. Wheelchair “died” on second day of cruise. Had folding wheelchair as backup. Have to be flexible when away from home and be prepared to improvise. 00:31:35: Must be observant, focused, aware of immediate surroundings. Power chair and gravel don’t mix. Listen to sounds. Heightened awareness of need for both to listen. 00:34:37: At trainings, people bring up problems with clients and how to resolve them. Every caregiver and every client is different. Make profession unique. Gets questions from 24/7 caregivers. Knows caregiver whose mother will not let anyone else care for her. Home is workplace. 00:38:31: Families tend to be domineering. Conflict with caregivers. Relative caregiver may take advantage of non-relative caregiver. Cannot leave client alone or without immediate means of contact. 00:40:21: Wants Becky to wake up with smile on her face. Does something silly or stupid. One of my jobs. Many home care workers have sense of caring. If not, they are in the wrong business. Spontaneous use of humor. Without humor and ability to laugh at yourself, you will be hurting. Job will get to you. 00:43:00: Need to be a good listener, both caregivers and union organizers. Anticipate what people need. Learned when logging with his dad. Carried over to caregiving. Not everyone can do that. 00:45:57: Gratifying when you help someone stay in their home. Strong bond as domestic partners. 22-year age difference. Concerned what would happen if he passes away. No concern about being an advocate. 95 percent of time try to turn negative into positive. 00:49:12: Last trip misfortunes. Lift in van malfunctioned. Does a lot of traveling. Wants to make sure Becky gets to go on cruises and do things she wants to do. 00:51:45: Dad was mechanic, brother was mechanic, another brother an electrician. Dad improvised, jerry-rigged things. Took five years of wood shop in high school. 2  00:52:45: One of biggest things from union was health insurance. 00:54:24: Told legislators about insurance and importance of keeping people in their homes rather than in nursing homes. People no longer live from paycheck-to-paycheck. Union has brought wages up. People take on too many clients when wages are insufficient. Burn themselves out. 00:57:32: Drawbacks of being home care or personal support worker. Become attached to clients and workers devastated when client passes away. 00:58:56: Live-in home workers barred from having other clients. Hourly—can work with as many clients as you want but there is a limit to what a person can handle. Make sure workers are healthy. Union helps indirectly. 01:03:31: SEIU and other entities come up with ideas. Make sure that new folks coming in get what they need to be good workers. 01:02:06: Feminine side of home care. Believes that men get in touch with other part of themselves as men. Not that you become feminine as a man, but that you get in touch with your nurturing side. Boon if you are a nurturer. 01:03:58: Other SEIU members often have no idea what caregivers do. Tries to explain. Notes special needs that some people have. Diabetes care and nutrition courses offered. 01:06:56: Organize your life. Organize your time. Must plan ahead. Must scout out new places in terms of wheelchair passage. 01:08:18: Reads, likes to budget for activities. 01:12:20: Home care workers getting involved in other things is to everybody’s advantage. Wears five different hats. Serves on home care commission training committee. 01:13:53: Need rapport with SPD (Seniors and People with Disabilities), case managers, clients.

TakingCare; Steve Tenhonen;xxxx;2014;Taking Care--Documenting the Occupational Culture of Home Care Workers   Archie Green Fellows Project, 2014-2015   (AFC 2014/021: 01300)   Archive of Folk Culture, American Folklife Center, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.   Steve Tenhonen interview, 2014-11-21 : interview conducted by Helen Marie   Moss   INTERVIEW LOG  00:00:00 Interviewee is signing documents, other housekeeping  talking to Don about how apartment is cold, has an earache, trying to get out of rent contract  complaining about being cold, why wearing hat, ear hurts.  00:05:24 Lives in Portland all of his life, great=grandfather was the governor of Oregon.  00:00:6:00 Been doing this work since 1989, and has always worked with developmentally disabled and schizophrenics. Tends to work with folks that other people don’t want to work with. Currently he goes to people’s homes.  00:00:7:00 He likes to work with people that other people are uncomfortable with: example of guy he worked with that thought he was Jesus Christ, had a great time together. They need someone to listen. He loves to go out hiking with them.  00:07:40 He has found that in cases of mental illness, people are afraid of them so don’t want to be around them. They are isolated and "they stew in their psychosis".  00:08:17 He started out working with MRDD sex offenders in group setting, many victimized as kids...some of the best people I have ever worked with  since then, I work with people other people are afraid of.  00:09:00 One guy walked out into traffic to prove he was Jesus, another led police on a high-speed chase. Other people try and tell the guy he isn’t Jesus. I listen to them  they need to talk about it without being corrected. I say: “I don’t think your father, God, would mind if we go for a hike”.  00:10:52 Parent don’t know what to do with them, but I get them out there and having fun. They improve.  00:12:10 Other jobs: Pizza maker, had a pervy boss who hit on women.  1    00:13:00 Difference between caregiving and other jobs: You can touch lives, not just punch a clock.  00:13:54 Could tell you about dark side of industry. There are patterns in caregiving world, in detox and group homes. There are people who care and there are people who are predators. Seen a lot of situations with predators. Also, good people who are burnt out.  00:15:30 Helps if you yourself have gone through things  too, then you have empathy. Two paths - become a predator or you become a person with empathy and can use it to help others.  00:16:32 As a professional, you don’t tell them about your past bad experiences, but they can see you are "real". That is what makes a good caregiver.  00:17:22 Advice: If you go into mental health system, make sure the person has malpractice insurance and a license. As an independent contractor for state of Oregon and under SEIU contract, have to have this. Some folks are not qualified, and really the state can’t do much if something goes wrong.  00:19:00 Have to ask caregiver probing questions, looking to see if have their own issues and not healed.  Can only take you as far as they have gone in own healing.  00:19:45 How did you get trained? I have empathy, I went to college for this, life-long journey.  00:20:30 Have friends I can compare notes with.  00:21:30 Discusses what good caregivers and psychologists do.  00:22:24 Typical day? Parents deserve medals because they haven’t given up, but tired.  00:23:27 I have a sense of humor, so parents who are about to have nervous breakdown, I come in and get them laughing. Get calls from crying moms, shake it off, and go to work.  00:24:24 How can you not get emotionally involved??? Set boundaries. Good people get burnt out because it is hard to set boundaries.  00:25:06 Story about addicted, HIV positive MRDD guy who had a child with his girlfriend and it was his job to help him take care of the child. Reported all of the problems to the state, took the baby away, everyone mad at him. Baby had a number of broken bones. Felt terrible, like he  2    didn’t get there fast enough. Baby died in protective custody. Took a leave of absence for a while after that. Don’t take on all cases now.  00:29:25 Example of client with head injury, biggest pervert in the world. But great sense of humor.  00:30:22 Behind the scenes terminology. Everyone has a sense of humor. I don’t see as many people as I did in group home setting.  00:31:14 Difference between group home and independent contractor - Like it that middle men are cut out, I like being independent contractor. Worked for companies and I saw a lot of corruption. Nepotism. Family members running amok. One client died from neglect. I turned them in. Program director embezzling.  00:33:12 Fired for union organizing. Why there is independent contractors now, lots of group home corruption, after suing, a family won lawsuit.  00:34:00 Now I have enough money to pay my bills, after making $9 an hour for years.  00:35:00 Different than group homes – I work directly with client and family  they can fire me if they don’t like me. I answer to them.  00:36:32 Have enough to put away for retirement now.  00:37:11 Miss some former co-workers, some are friends now. One manager “had his back”. 00:38:29 Someone from the outside listening to him talk about clients would get freaked out.  00:39:45 Hard to explain culture but it is there. Learn quirks. Lot of clients, and men in general, are awkward with women. We all have sex drive, imagine how it is to think you are Jesus and have a sex drive. These guys want a sex life, so funny things can happen. I’m like the big brother. Learn to laugh at it.  00:41:57 Nicknames for some of these types of mistakes. We laugh a lot but not laughing at them. Stories like telling girl at bank she has great tits, or trying to pay an escort with pork chops. I try to direct them to other ways to meet women.  00:43:31 I don’t work with women – not with the types of people I work with. In these cases, I think it is best for men to work with men, women with women. People who have sex disorders, this is best.  3    00:44:00 Most gratifying? - is when I realize I am doing something: hear from parents that son was depressed but now better.  00:44:43 What is the worst? - Story about client who swallowed batteries.  00:49:07 Union difference – Night and Day. Ronald Reagan broke the unions. Unions not perfect, but listen to what I just said about corruption. Google my name, I was fired for union activity. All of what I did, for $9. I am fucked without a union. I hate the Koch brothers. Look on the internet, trying to bust unions. Scott Walker busting unions.  00:52:41 Without unions won’t get people who care, get predators, huge turnover. I have been with my clients for 5 years, clients need this stability. That is what a union is good for. They are what you make of them.  00:54:05 Now can go to doctor, help with legal situations.  00:55:16 CHANGE TO A NEW VIDEOTAPE.  00:55:46 Put my video on YouTube so everyone can see it.  00:56:00 He is the pressure valve for clients and their parents, so can’t always do the union events. He has to be available.  00:57:29 State was going to cut wage, not Governor Kitzhaber’s idea. But union was in his face – so decided not to slash my wage by $10 an hour. I pay my own malpractice, taxes. $24 an hour before taxes, malpractice. It boils down $15 an hour. It is less expensive to pay caregiver than if one of the client’s snaps and they are put in mental institution or police deal with them. I also pay health care. It is worth investing in me.  01:00:44 Caregiving largest industry, lot of mental health issues in US. Supreme Court decision that we cannot be a group, form a union, is terrible.  01:01:41 Jon Stewart Show story, talking about Koch brothers.  1:02:28 Hobbies – Didn’t ever have money to travel, but I embrace my "Oregon-ness" and I hike in gorge, nature resets me. Yoga too, film junkie.  01:03:30 High blood pressure, so changed diet and started exercising.  4    01:05:05 – How does community see you? Parents of the clients think of us as angels. Client with severe brain injury story, taught himself to talk and walk, overcame anger issues. Great but doesn’t have good filters.  1:07:16 Part of my job is damage control. For example, inappropriate sexual behavior. To his Mom, I am a saint.  01:08:33 – Others think I just sit around and watch TV.  01:09:50 Some people appreciate the work we do, others think we have a cushy job, but don’t understand the stress, but the stress of the system is there also. Right trying to get rid of SS and Medicaid.  CHANGE BATTERY  01:10:50 Glad that you are receptive to what I am saying.  01:11:52 Parents appreciate us. Don’t know who to call, they call me. I help them and it takes pressure off.  01:12:39 Others who think it is a cush job, and republicans who want to bust unions.  01:13:37 Our clients are up against a system, have to navigate ss [Social Security], Medicaid, medicare. Elements out there that want to get rid of this  this is horseshit. Those programs keep the clients alive. Not perfect, but all we have. Navigating them is hard, part of my stress is helping them do this. Navigating the state agencies is difficult and exhausting.  01:16:10 Money in industry now because of ACA [Affordable Care Act], first time in 30 years seeing this. Mentally ill people on streets. Our president has created ACA, and my clients have some money and it is nice. Not a lot, but more. Things might get better in state agencies.  01:17:44 Best investment for society, is investing in care for mentally ill. Invest in getting them into a good apartment, good caregiver, consistency, they are comfortable and do alright.  01:18:59 How does the community benefit – not on streets causing problems. Families have less stress. Count on the fact they can call Steve. Better at their jobs, no stress related illness, nervous breakdown. Clients sometimes get jobs, so it is a production thing, a moral thing.  01:21:51 After 30 years, not much of a retirement, don’t have a lot to show (crying). If someone watching, this can create a better situation for mentally ill and people like me in the future.  5    01:23:24 More about politics: Koch brothers and union busting. I care about my country, want to see it get back to fair and balanced.  01:24:30 Talking about corrupt program where he used to work, and hopes that someone in power will hear this tape and do something. Nice to feel appreciated.  6         
TakingCare; Shaun Notdurft;xxxx;2015;Taking Care--Documenting the Occupational Culture of Home Care Workers   Archie Green Fellows Project, 2014-2015   (AFC 2014/021: 01640)   Archive of Folk Culture, American Folklife Center, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.   Shaun Notdurft interview, 2015-03-22 : interview conducted by Nathan J.   Moore and Donald Eugene Stacy   INTERVIEW LOG  00:00:20 Name is Shaun Notdurft. Lives in Springfield, Oregon, but works in Eugene, Oregon.  00:00:30 Has worked as a direct support professional (DSP) for 21 years. Works with clients with developmental and mental disabilities.  00:01:00 Home care workers work in homes that are owned or rented by clients. Clients of DSPs live in group homes managed by a company.  00:01:37 Had friends who worked for Oregon Supported Living Program (OSLP). Was introduced to clients and thought work was fascinating.  00:02:05 Previous jobs: worked in department store, worked as landscape laborer, delivered Wall St. Journal.  00:02:27 Previous jobs involved making money for someone else. His labor now goes directly to clients.  00:03:09 Special qualities needed? Patience, assertiveness, boundary setting skills.  00:03:57 How did you learn the skills? Trainings provide general understanding, but you cannot teach a style. Workers develop individual relationships with clients. Takes training every two years on recognizing and redirecting problem behaviors.  00:05:30 Developing a style – a balance between the client's history, individual support plan, and the ability to think outside of the box. You have to improvise  similar to playing music.  00:07:23 Is there such a thing as a typical day in your field? It depends on the house. Some clients work, others participate in community activities. Typical activities depend on the day of the week.  1    00:08:34 What kinds of activities do you do with clients? Community inclusion – examples: taking clients to bar and store.  00:09:41 Relationships with clients – Avoids forming friendships. Is somewhat different from other DSPs. Successes and failures of clients should belong to them. “I support, I guide, but I don't own any of it.” Workers who get too close to clients become co-dependent and burn out.  00:11:44 Maintains distance but does not “snub” client.  00:12:49 Some clients have family members in area. He sometimes communicates with family members, which can be helpful for understanding behavioral issues.  00:15:53 Insider talk among DSPs – There are a lot of “insider jokes.”  00:16:20 Question asked by Don Stacy: What is “house culture”? In a “medical house,” clients have intense physical needs  culture is nurturing. In behavioral houses, you have to possess a “paradox personality"  must be extremely individual but work as a team player, too. A worker who is unable to set boundaries becomes “weak link.” Important for a good “house culture” to organically develop. Currently employed in a house with 7 workers. All workers and clients are males.  00:19:09 Humor is important, but needs to be about changing energy flow and never be malicious. Humor between staff is different than humor with clients. Co-worker humor takes place away from clients. Laughter provides physical stress release.  00:21:30 Some houses socialize outside of work. Shaun's house has staff meetings every other week. Humor dialed back around administrators. Describes co-workers as having “crass” senses of humor. Humor would be different if co-workers were women.  00:23:29 Inside humor – Clients have certain idiosyncrasies. “If you're not in that setting, and therefore know that individual, you'd have no basis to understand what's happening or the riffing on that.”  00:24:30 Acronyms describing different care professionals are not interchangeable. DSPs provide care in homes, but not home care workers. PSWs are much closer to home care workers except that they are hired through brokerages. DSPs go to an established work site, which also serves as a home for clients. There are OSHA standards even though work occurs in a home.  00:26:35 Serves as president of the local for OSLP and chief steward. Handles contract issues, bargaining. Also on board of directors for statewide union. Represents members in private non-profits.  2    00:27:40 Union duties depend on the issue. Gives explanation of steward duties. Has equal standing with management when acting as steward. Enjoys problem solving aspects. Union allows workers have a say about the type of care provided to clients. Worked at OSLP for three years before forming a union. Primary reason for organizing into SEIU: to have a protected voice on the job and be a part of the lives and the plans of the people for whom they care.  00:30:45 Comment by Don Stacy, who also works as a DSP, about DSPs not being allowed to strike. Only half correct. DSPs cannot strike while collective bargaining agreement is in effect. If agreement expires, DSPs have right to strike, but have never come close to striking. Discusses possible scenarios for a strike.  00:33:07 Some clients are aware of union, want to be involved, and have gone to Salem to lobby on behalf of DSPs. Workers try to keep union issues out of day-to-day care.  00:33:49 Goes to many “lobby days” at the State Capitol.  00:34:48 There can be a rally atmosphere, but lobby days more about meeting telling stories to legislators. Important to get on their radars. Feels change happens in conversation with people who hold purse strings.  00:35:30 Sharing personal stories is important. Union used to focus a lot on clients' lives, but now focusing more on what workers need. Emphasizing the importance of workers who have been in the field for a long time.  00:37:50 Has no children, which is an anomaly in field. Can afford low wages. A lot of good DSPs left the field because they could not provide for their children.  00:39:52 Starting wage close to Oregon's minimum wage. Home care workers and personal support workers start at a wage that is higher than a DSP's top pay. Don Stacy discusses “topping out” at $12.90 per hour.  00:40:55 A big benefit of being a DSP as opposed to a personal support worker: DSPs have set schedule and PSWs' schedules are set by clients.  00:42:20 Discusses oversight of DSPs in comparison to personal support workers. State inspects group homes with “fine tooth comb"  this does not happen in “in-home situations.”  00:44:02 Discusses trainings DSPs take each year. Mentions that home care workers are trying to get more trainings in their field.  3    00:46:03 Most interesting training: Oregon Intervention System training  focuses on recognizing when a behavioral issue is becoming present before it is full blown. Has used techniques to avoid a bar fight.  00:47:41 Most appealing aspect of your work? It varies. The one that is most present is the knowledge that clients' lives are directly impacted by the work.  00:49:53 DSPs do not produce a commodity. “In our field of work, we don't have anything concrete like that other than when we go back to the next day and they're still there and they're still living a good life.” Workers provide consistency, trust, and even love.  00:51:02 Agrees that legislators and others may not know DSPs exist because they do not produce a consumable commodity. People in the community gravitate toward positive stories and think work is fun. There are unpleasant stories too. Gives example of having furniture thrown at him. Staff who know how to handle difficult situations should be supported.  00:54:14 How do you relax? Plays and listen to music. Likes to read history. Hobbies represent “bigger picture stuff” beyond daily work.  00:56:00 Main reason for DSPs being paid less than other care providers: only two unionized group home providers in Oregon. Nursing homes seeing improvements in wages and conditions due to neutrality agreement with employers. Difficult to organize in private sector.  01:00:19 Thinks only way DSPs will gain power is if there is a neutrality agreement that allows union organizers to talk to workers without backlash.  01:01:11 The employers have own union: The Oregon Rehabilitation Association (ORA) is anti-union. And lobbies legislators. Possible that legislature will see that unionization has helped the nursing industry.  01:03:51 Is there solidarity between the different types of care providers in the state? There is now. OSLP organized in 1996 and then home care workers organized later. There has been competition between groups, but this is something Shaun and other union activists are working to defeat.  01:05:54 Most DSPs are women because the job is perceived as “women's work.”  01:08:15 Some houses are male-only due to behavioral issues. Could change if certain clients leave. Clients have a choice if they want to work with women or men. Don Stacy notes that it is more common to have a house that consists of mixed-gendered staff members.  4    01:10:10 There are DSPs who have been home care workers. Some workers at OSLP are also home care providers and/or personal support workers. Some DSPs have left OSLP to become home care workers.  01:15:10 Does the community at large understand what DSPs do? If you ask people, they will say they do not know anything about it, but if you point out a DSP working in the community, people will recognize them. There is more visibility than there is conscious knowledge.  01:16:11 Discussion between Shaun, Nathan, and Don about the “Look Me In The Eye” campaign in Eugene, Oregon — a campaign to acknowledge and respect people with developmental disabilities. Shaun provides historical background of campaign.  01:18:15 Wonders if community members think DSP workers are family members of volunteers. You cannot provide enough services with volunteers.  01:19:25 Work done by DSPs cannot be done by anyone else. Home care workers cannot help clients without homes. Argues that the “home care model” does not work for everyone. Also talks about possible industry changes.  01:23:47 Discussion between Don Stacy and Shaun about “good shepherd moments,” or moments when community members refer to DSPs as saints. Well-meaning, but discounts the work. Important “It's not a disservice to us to see us as compassionate, but if they assume that our value derived from our work is that compassion, then why would they want to care about our paychecks.”  01:28:05 Some people enter the field because they think it's “god's work.” They do not last long. Continued discussion of this topic.  01:32:43 Would like to retire as a DSP, but there are physical factors. May transition to an ombudsman/advocacy position.  01:40:16 Mentions that there are many for-profit houses for similar types of clients. Some have high turnover rates. Many for-profit care companies are not local and administrators live out of the area.  01:46:20 End of interview.  5       
TakingCare;Sharronne Vincent;xxxx;2015;Taking Care--Documenting the Occupational Culture of Home Care Workers  Archie Green Fellows Project, 2014-2015  (AFC 2014/021: 01720)  Archive of Folk Culture, American Folklife Center, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.  Sharronne Vincent interview, 2015-03-04 : interview conducted by Helen  Marie Moss and Donald Eugene Stacy  INTERVIEW LOG 00:00:00 - Set up. 00:00:31 Lives in Deer Island, she explains how the small town got its name. 00:01:27 Other jobs - eldest child, Bank of CA, waitress at fancy Eugene hotel, MA in curriculum development, taught school, taught adult education classes, owned a design house for gowns, then had an accident, returned to teaching, some work with Weyerhauser driving a fork lift. Paid twice as much at Weyerhauser than as a teacher. Needed the money. Retired, friend needed help with a client, that was her start, about 5.5 years ago. Very gratifying work. 00:04:45 Then this same friend was in an accident, so she provided care for her. 00:05:08 How did you learn skills? My brother suffered a head injury as a child, disabled, started over in learning everything. I took care of him when he was an adult. She tells a story about her brother receiving his first paycheck and how proud and excited he was. 00:06:35 What makes caregiving different? Much like being a teacher. Really care about the people, same kind of guidelines. You become aware of age in a way you never have before. You realize how fragile the elderly become. Amazing journey with each client. 00:08:26 Sometimes learn more than you want to. Family money issues (discussion about whether she should talk about an issue, whether it breaches confidentiality). Tells the story of the sister of a client who changed the mother's will and how it negatively impacted the client, but nothing she can do about these types of incidents except be there for them. 00:10:45 They are like your children, you care about them. Create stressors at the end of your day? Yes, the example of the sister that she just told us, that was stressful. Sister did not even sit at the same table with the client when they visited. You learn what you can do something about, and what you cannot do anything about. 1  00:12:14 Skills? Have to be patient, not react to what the clients do sometimes. You are walking into their house, their life. Stay positive. It can be very disheartening when their families don't come around so much. 00:13:35 You need to know what path to take to not offend them. Having a disabled brother helped me learn. 00:14:08 Typical day? Depends on personality of client. Two clients, very different. Describes the day with one client that she works with every morning. Most important thing is to interact with them. Become more than someone that just works with them, doing tasks. 00:16:20 In America we don't bring elderly into our lives like we used to. 00:17:00 Some people are old at 60, others are young at 102. 00:17:31 How approach intimate tasks? Carefully, if a gentleman. First consideration is modesty. Try to be very respectful. 00:19:15 Stories? Mother of her friend. Didn't want people to wait on her. Story about serving dinner and the client kidding her about the portion size. 00:20:26 Sense of humor? Essential. If don't laugh you will cry. Find things that bring them joy and laughter. Story about another client who would say "life is hard and then you die," and her 5 year old grandchild called her on it. 00:22:11 What do home care workers talk about when together? We talk about clients and different scenarios, sharing and comparing and learning from each other. No two people are the same, or react the same way. Bunch of us talk without using names. Trade stories and how we dealt with things, and then we say enough of this! and talk about something else. 00:23:21 Union? Sounds overly dramatic, when I started helping friend and joined union, the union saved my emotional life. Hard when you don't have a purpose, union gave me a purpose. I enjoy the classes and have learned. Lobby days? Yes, my first lobby day I met my legislator, and I told him the story of my brother and he gave me a hug. 00:27:20 What would you tell someone who has never done care? About the delicate balance between respect and having to do what you need to do. 00:28:07 Do you feel that the community at large understands the work that you do? Some are very aware and caring, and there are more people that don't know what we do. So busy with their lives they don't think about what older people need, don't see caregiver in the same light as 2  other workers. It is like castes in India: we are the bottom caste that does the necessary tasks no one else wants to do. We give the person we are caring for a chance to have a life. 00:30:17 Hobbies, used to dance, but now can't so much. Was a city girl, but bought property because she rescued a colt. Volunteers at animal rescue, lots of animals at the house. Loves gardening, loves creating. Talks about her garden art project. 00:32:45 Anything else? I want people to know fulfilling being a caregiver can be. 00:33:36 Do a few more years? Yes, as long as I can. I will stay involved with the union until I can't anymore. 00:35:00 iscussion about generational differences and the interest in "electronics." She thinks this could impact caregiving for the older generation, clash of cultures. We don't honor our elderly like we used to. Talks about caring for her mother and grandmother, it was just what you did. 00:38:00 Did things with grandparents, story of barn dance with Russian grandfather. I don't think this generation has had this experience because women have been allowed to blossom in lots of other ways than when I was younger. Will affect their willingness to take on the care of a parent. Not sure how it will work out. Staying in the home is not part of this generation like it used to be. They care, it is just different. 00:42:17 End of interview. 3      
TakingCare; Sally K. Cumberworth;1959;2014;Taking Care--Documenting the Occupational Culture of Home Care Workers  Archie Green Fellows Project, 2014-2015  (AFC 2014/021: 01461)  Archive of Folk Culture, American Folklife Center, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.  Sally K. Cumberworth interview, 2014-12-16 : interview conducted by  Michael Robert Bussel  INTERVIEW LOG 00: 00:33: Born in Roseburg, Oregon in 1959. Lives in Cave Junction, Oregon. Has five children. Went into home care after getting divorced. Allowed her to remain in her community. 00:01:57: Other jobs: Has degree in accounting. Owned trucking business with former husband and kept books. After divorce, needed work. Had cared for grandparents when younger. Has been caregiver since 1994. 00:03:05: Types of clients: paraplegics, shut-ins. For those living in remote locations, only person they saw. Had client for ten years with developmental disabilities. Now has two persons she cares for consistently. 00:05:14: Caregiving offers chance to give back. Nurturing person. In office, you have desk, set hours, know your job. Caregiving...you take to heart. Help people to live independently until the time they need greater care. 00:06:51: Special skills needed: must love to care. Not just a paycheck. Stay in community and give back to people who have worked all their lives. Can’t treat caregiving like punching a time clock. Must be honest. Negotiation over work that clients demand and what state will allow. 00:09:57: People are lonely. Want companionship. Become like family but must set boundaries. People want to give you gifts or presents but not allowed. 00:11:39: Emotional involvement tough, especially when people pass away. Take time to grieve. If people go into a home, will ask if you’ll stop by to visit. Separation is part of the job. Take time off in these cases before taking on a new client. 00:13:34: See people naked, it doesn’t get any more intimate. Learn about their kids, families. They tell you all their stories. You become a “vessel” for stories about their lives. 1  00:14:32: Learn to be detached when you help people with intimate activities. Clean up accidents. People must trust you with their bodily functions. One woman didn’t like taking baths. Made it into a “spa day.” Give people choices. Giving them dignity is huge. Offer clues, reminders, without yelling. 00:17:52: Learn things over time. Different clients require different strategies. People can still fold laundry or sweep from a wheelchair. Encourages them to do things. Home care commission has wonderful classes. 00:20:19: Learn clients’ preference for how they want tasks to be done. Hard for people to have someone in their home. They don’t know how to be a “boss.” Negotiate with them on how they want tasks to be done. 00:23:15: People lose pieces of themselves. Don’t make a big deal out of what they can’t do. Capitalize on things they can still do. 00:23:55: Family members sometimes ask caregivers to do things for them in addition to caring for client. Task list may differ from family expectations. 00:27:40: Families mostly respect and appreciate work. One of scariest moments: woman in her care died while they were having a conversation. Briefly revived her, then she died. 00:29:27: Typical day: get client ready for day. Has lung problem — takes time to get ready. Check blood sugar, prepare breakfast. Do laundry, cleaning, take to appointments. 00:31:00: Depression is huge. Clients want companionship, someone to talk to. Important to maintain a positive attitude. 00:31:39: Stories clients tell are wonderful. Learn about history. They also ask about my life. Live vicariously through my experience and that of my family. Clients live in remote places, often get few visitors. My experience gives them something else to think about. 00:33:49: Reads mail for clients with bad vision. Have to keep personal information confidential. In small town, people pump you for information. 00:35:49: Humor: must laugh at yourself. If something goes wrong, try to turn it around. Don’t want to dump your problems on someone and have them worry about you. 00:40:30: Clients sometimes angry and hurting. Can take it out on you. Must be like duck and let it pour off you. Can’t internalize. Sometimes you are not a good fit with a client and need to leave. 2  00:42:15: Caregiving can be thankless, but is also gratifying. Family acknowledged her work at eulogy for client who had died. Difficult when you get attached. Had one client who loved to see her kids perform, came to her home for holidays. Often clients don’t get better. Lady I take care of now regularly expresses appreciation. 00:46:15: Goes ballroom dancing with one client on Friday afternoons. 00:47:05: Union organizer had to come to her house three times before she joined. Didn’t see union connection immediately. Husband volunteered her to be phone tree captain. Then elected to bargaining committee and has been on bargaining team for first five contracts. 00:51:15: Importance of workers’ compensation. Huge to get it for workers who get hurt on the job. 00:52:51: Important to protect hours one can spend with clients. Case of mother-in-law who didn’t qualify for services. 00:56:04: Spoke to legislators about budget and moved them. Client would have been in foster care rather than at home without her caring for him. Can live in dignity at home and is cheaper than foster care. Can’t make decisions in foster care. Lose humanity when being told what to do. 00:58:59: Personal support client asked “When can I be in the union?” Took him to Salem on lobby day. Told legislators his story. Loves to tell people she is his “employee.” Has his own purple SEIU T-shirt. Went to all bargaining sessions. 01:02:25: Asked for gloves in bargaining. Asked “don’t you carry gloves?” Decorated office with purple gloves. “Land of perfect”: retire and everything is wonderful. People in Salem not wiping bottoms or helping people choose between pink and blue outfit. Job takes a lot out of me. 01:04:59: When hours are cut, doesn’t show appreciation. People fought in world wars, worked hard all their lives. Couldn’t get dignity and respect language in first contract. In land of perfect —all get respect. 01:06:10: People with disabled children shouldn’t have less. What makes people happy is being in their homes. In nursing home: most you have is picture on the wall, have to share bathroom. Not living life to best of your ability. 01:08:35: Keep people in home as long as possible. Happy, surrounded by memories. Pets are huge. Love you unconditionally. 3  01:10:29: Leisure activities: goes dancing. Has five children, thirteen grandchildren. Has animals, does gardening. 01:12:55: Second son has cystic fibrosis. Has been a caregiver all her life and a nurturer. Taking care of people is what I love to do. Book work didn’t “fill me.” 01:16:08: Job path has enriched my life. Stories I have heard: one client a concert pianist, another a longshoreman who put his life on the line to get a union. 01:17:08: Chicago was place where seven people and an SEIU organizer began home care organizing. Told it couldn’t be done. Got “Trailblazer” award for her work and felt like she had won a Tony. “Invisible No More” T-shirts made. Got living wage for doing work that lots of people don’t see as important. Paid days off, too. 01:24:20: End of interview. 4    
TakingCare; Rose M. Rogers;1949;2015;Taking Care--Documenting the Occupational Culture of Home Care Workers   Archie Green Fellows Project, 2014-2015   (AFC 2014/021: 01560)   Archive of Folk Culture, American Folklife Center, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.   Rose M. Rogers interview, 2015-01-21 : interview conducted by Nathan J.   Moore and Donald Eugene Stacy   INTERVIEW LOG  00:00:00 Introductions, signing of release forms, explanation of project.  00:04:30 Name is Rose Rogers, born on May 25, 1949 in Grand Rapids, MI. Moved to the West Coast in 1988. Met husband after he served in Vietnam. Both lived in Pennsylvania for around 17 years.  00:05:40 When did you start doing caregiving? Since I've had children (laughing). Son has autism and bipolar. Been employed as his caregiver since he turned eighteen  roughly twelve years.  00:06:58 Previously work—odd jobs, paper route, childcare. Worked on the 2010 Census.  00:08:05 Her son can't care for himself. He was in an adult transition program from the ages of eighteen to twenty one. Qualified for DHS services after that. If he was somewhere else, he would have to receive care. Rose takes him to Special Olympics, other outings. He doesn't understand a lot of things, but he's very good at fixing things, playing video games.  00:10:31 Difference between being official care provider and regular parent? It's more guidance than parenting. Working with the union and meeting other caregivers has been helpful. Learned more about autism through the union.  00:12:00 Union “helps us carry on.” It's hard not to get overwhelmed. Hopes that medications get better over time. Family also provides support.  00:13:43 Has met other parents in similar situations. Met one woman through the union who was very encouraging. Her son has also learned that he needs to be treated well  he knows that he has civil rights. He can get angry sometimes. Rose deals with this by advocating for him.  00:15:42 Has gone to lobby days. Very important for home care workers to gather together and speak to politicians.  1    00:16:56 Has spoken at lobby days, which was frightening. Usually more of a background person. Once you're encouraged by others, you feel comfortable doing it. Knows her situation is important.  00:17:48 Has taken her son to lobby days. He learned a lot, started talking about his civil rights. Held up signs. Learned union chants. Gives example: “We are the union, the mighty, might union. Fighting for justice.”  00:18:49 Went once to a meeting in Coos Bay with local officials. Asked why her son was being paid below minimum wage at his job. Why is it called “work” if they won't pay him? Very frustrating to Rose and her husband.  00:23:18 Father was a union painter. Rose went to union halls, Christmas parties, and other events as a child. Probably wouldn't have had her eye operations if father was not in the union. Father had retirement benefits and good pay.  00:25:20 Typical duties — helps son eat properly, keeps him on a schedule, helps him make choices. Receives backup support from husband. Son lives with parents  a 24/7 job. Feels that he wouldn't have as much freedom and support in a different environment. Other caregivers from the union fill in if Rose is gone. Son likes to stay overnight with other family members.  00:31:29 How do you relax? Takes son to Special Olympics—a time to relax and watch him enjoy himself.  00:32:11 Most gratifying part of the job: doing something for humanity. Son has so much to offer. He likes to help people. There are frustrating times, too.  00:33:16 Not a hobby person. Likes to go to the union meetings, though. Family is her hobby. Doesn't want to miss out on life.  00:34:17 Has gone to union meetings once a month for at least two years, ever since SEIU organized personal support workers.  00:34:41 Has been told, “You don't need a union.” Doesn't see herself as an outspoken person who can come back with a quick response, but knows from her life that she does need the union.  00:36:00 Her son sees friends at Special Olympics. Plays basketball. Family encourages him. He has decided to play softball for the first time. He does bowling in the fall. She sees other home care workers at Special Olympics. Often a time to talk about frustrations. Shares example  2    of meeting a woman and encouraging her to get more services for her own son. Proud of helping another home care worker and being inspired by the union to do so.  00:41:55 The hardest part of the job? Communicating about simple things with her son. Example of him refusing to take out the trash. Always has to remind her son about everything.  00:44:12 Has learned a lot about autism but there's so much too learn. Learns a lot from her son.  00:45:00 Does the community understand what you do? Thinks the community would understand more if son lived in a group home. People think that it's not work to take care of your own son at home. He's over eighteen, though, and can't support himself. “It is work. I am doing my work along with his work.”  00:47:44 Sees herself doing other work, if not caring for son — home care, childcare, working on the census. Even being a stay-at-home mother is a lot of work. “We're building the cornerstones  we're building our future.”  00:51:18 What are your hopes for you son? Has seen ups and downs associated with mental illness. Has also seen the greatness of defeating it at times. It's never completely defeated. Hopes that her son has strength to keep going. Discusses advocating for her son, writing letters to mental health specialists and counselors. Medications only work so long. Hopes that scientists are working on better medications.  00:55:42 Talks about helping son make good nutritional decisions. Reading serving size information on packages works. Discussion between Don Stacy and Rose about giving clients guidance as a relative versus being a non-relative.  00:59:52 Discusses how she noticed son's autism when he was five. He was in Head Start and the teachers and doctors did not notice it. Explains it as a mother's instinct.  01:01:11 You have to have humor on the job. Jokes with son about various things. Easy to joke with him because he is a family member. Finds it humorous that her son can beat her at chess every time.  01:04:51 End of interview.  3  
TakingCare; Rita Adamski;1952;2014;Taking Care--Documenting the Occupational Culture of Home Care Workers  Archie Green Fellows Project, 2014-2015  (AFC 2014/021: 01360)  Archive of Folk Culture, American Folklife Center, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.

Non-verbal. Helps him be part of community. Marvelous example of family support. Takes him swimming. Use I-Pad to give him different choices. Likes to go bowling. Eat lunch out. Look at Christmas items. 00:05:58: Typical day. Get out of the house. Atypical day — grounded, in case of seizure, but unusual. Client has 40 Elmo dolls in his room.

Couldn’t finish college. Mother is registered nurse and Catholic. Grew up with mother who took care of neighbors. Sister has friend with traumatic brain injury. 00:08:40: Catholicism, passion for neighbors, feeling of community. In it together. 00:09:23: Special skills or characteristics of caregivers. Need to listen. Listen to what your boss wants, even if you think she is wrong. Help you to be independent and be who you are. Make your choices with dignity in your own home. 1  00:10:55: Willing to help boss have things their way. Be more humble than you want to be. Job requires certain skills such as dealing with catheters, colostomy bags, wound care. Learn about resources in the community. 00:12:42: Learned through experience. Advantage in previous work to have had registered nurse to call on. “Delegation”: term related to registered nurse teaching a home care worker. Contract between patient, nurse and caregiver. Nurse teaches you a skill such as checking blood sugar. Workers can be “delegated” to do other things. Has taken classes. Most important were on preventing spread of disease and medication. Five rights of giving medication. 00:15:57: Has become close friends with former clients. If not a good match, will say so. If not a good match, sometimes will exit. On every block, someone quietly takes care of somebody. 00:17:16: Worries about getting too involved with family. Gets to know names of children and grand-children. One of biggest adventures was as respite worker. Helped man with dementia travel to South Carolina and say good-by to his family. 00:18:38: Too much emotional involvement at times. When you love and admire someone, easy to be connected. 00:20:41: On a first-name basis with clients. Man who doesn’t speak calls her “Zooey” after Sesame Street character. Called “Ditto” when family member was also named Rita. 00:21:56: Use of term “my lady” and “my man” to describe clients. Honors their privacy. 00:22:46: Jargon not used that much by caregivers. ADL: Activities of Daily Living...there are seven of them. Learned “funny looking kid” at university or FLK to describe child with problems. 00:25:38: Many different ways to be a caregiver. Best job is working with "my man" who is developmentally disabled. Has held hands with people who are dying. Will help people do what they want. Helped veteran get back on his feet. Sometimes does housekeeping and meals preparation. 00:27:10: Wound care for woman who just got out of hospital. Partner hung blue pads on tree, even though they were spoiled. Contrast this with client who had home on the bay with African art. Family support makes a difference. 00:28:28: Talks with clients. Avoid talking about politics unless we agree. People ask “why” something happened to them. Seeks conversation where she has something in common with her clients. Will say “I absolutely agree with you,” if they are watching Fox News. 2  00:31:17: Caregivers talk about how to handle insurance problems. Talk about aspects of work that are problematic. Don’t talk about “employer-clients” due to rules of confidentiality. 00:32:19: How to describe people you work with. “Client” is two-way term. Seen as equal. Doesn’t like “customer” as a term. Prefers to say “employer” or “boss.” Customer superficial. Client conveys something equal. 00:33:55: People who need caregivers have some kind of struggle. In it together. Try to find the positive and keep it friendly. Talks with client’s mother. Marvels at her “consistency” in making mistakes. Put disposable tab on briefs on backwards for three weeks. 00:37:10: Relationships with people gratifying. Lived in small town. Prior to 1987, nursing homes were warehouses for old people. Helped Parkinson’s patient stay in their own home. Help Vietnam veteran get back on his feet. Rewarding. 00:38:44: One client says she was “perfect.” Another called her “precious,” another “phenomenal.” Jokes that dementia patients are not confused! 00:40:06: Spent hours with elderly at bedside while dying. Very isolating. Only knows five or ten out of 250 people in home care association. Doesn’t see other caregivers that much. Homes not always nice to work in. Employment not always convenient. Work can be repetitive and boring. 00:42:52: Can read sometimes at work. Picks up chocolate on way home after hard day. 00:43:22: Union has made big difference in her life. Employer’s mother very supportive and brought her union membership form. 00:44:44: Health insurance premiums go up. Before joining union a year ago, paid $550 a month for insurance. More than half of income went to insurance. After joining SEIU, received 20 percent pay increase. Health insurance much less expensive. 00:46:32: Trying to learn about getting involved more in the union. Anticipates she will get more involved. 00:47:50: No difference in caring for men or women. 00:48:46: People would be surprised that home care workers “carry it in our hearts.” Proud that she has helped people live the lives they want. Proud to have helped them stay out of nursing homes or assisted living a little longer. 3  00:50:01: Current employer...some might see disabled young man. Doing fine, not suffering. Injury is sad, but his life is pretty good. See the positive. 00:52:55: Loves to read. Involved in Beginning Experience, a faith-based grief support group. Wants to introduce granddaughter to paddling in the summer. 00:52:55: Challenging if you don’t get new clients after someone has died. Took care of person with breast cancer who died. Took time off. Then had a potential client die before she even got to take care of him. Two weeks unemployed. Financial issue. Job is blessing in my heart in many ways, but can be an expensive job sometimes. 00:55:14: End of life not sad or tragic. Celebrate good a person has done and that they have had a full life. Dealing with death scary at first, but not later. 00:56:07: Helps people who are dying do what they want to do. Have coffee with girlfriend. Go to restaurant. Helps in that way. 00:56:58: End of interview. 4     
TakingCare;Rhonda Estrada;xxxx;2015;Taking Care--Documenting the Occupational Culture of Home Care Workers   Archie Green Fellows Project, 2014-2015   (AFC 2014/021: 02026)   Archive of Folk Culture, American Folklife Center, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.   Rhonda Estrada interview, 2015-05-26 : interview conducted by Nathan J.   Moore and Donald Eugene Stacy   INTERVIEW LOG  00:00:29 Name is Rhonda Estrada. Lives in Hermiston, Oregon. Has been a home care worker since 2007.  00:00:43 Works mostly as a home care provider for Senior & Disabled Services, but recently became a personal support worker (PSW).  00:01:03 How did you become a home care worker? Worked for migrant Head Start for five years, and a friend asked her to work as a substitute home care provider. The consumer let her friend go and hired her. Then she began to work for Senior & Disabled Services.  00:02:02 Previous jobs - worked in the fast food industry. Caregiving is different because there is more compassion involved. The pace is slower as well.  00:03:00 Special qualities needed? Compassion and patience.  00:03:17 How did you gain your job skills? Became a mother at a young age  has four children.  00:03:37 Typical duties - grocery shopping, helping clients with laundry, taking consumers to medical appointments, providing medication help, housekeeping. Currently has three consumers.  00:04:10 Works 25-30 hours per week.  00:04:20 Do you become close to your consumers? Has known one of her consumers for 25 years, and she does not want anyone else to work for her. They are able to maintain a professional relationship during Rhonda's working hours. Rhonda takes her job very seriously.  00:06:00 She does get to know some of her consumers' family members.  1    00:07:02 There a lot of caregivers in her area. They get together through the union. Rhonda is very active in SEIU. She helps run meetings in Umatilla County, serves as an alternate on the bargaining team, and serves as a steward.  00:08:06 The union was around when she started working as a caregiver. Went to her first meeting and immediately joined. “SEIU [Service Employees International Union] has been amazing for me.” Has traveled to Minnesota and Pennsylvania to help start unions and also attended a leadership conference in St. Louis. Did not know that she was a leader until the union picked her to go. She did not travel at all before becoming a union activist.  00:10:30 Discusses what she tells potential union members when going door-to-door during organizing drives.  00:11:00 Talks about meeting new friends through the union.  00:11:29 Discusses talking to legislators about her work. Had not previously participated in public speaking.  00:12:04 Having a sense of humor on the job is important. She can laugh and joke with one of her current clients.  00:12:46 What you do to relax? Takes care of her family, which is very important to her.  00:13:39 Hardest part of your job? Being a personal support worker (PSW) and working with people with mental disabilities. Rhonda's daughter-in-law is a PSW supervisor and convinced her to become one. The consumers tend to be more challenging than people with physical disabilities.  00:15:05 She recently recruited her daughters into the home care industry. Both of them work in Umatilla County.  00:15:40 Asserts that Umatilla County needs more home care workers. Talks about a client who faced significant health and financial challenges and only receives 20 hours per month of care.  00:18:00 Was on the SEIU bargaining team two years ago. The union received two raises–one from $10.20 per hour to $13 per hour and another from $13 per hour to $13.75 per hour. Currently fighting for $15 per hour plus retirement and sick leave pay.  00:18:51 Paid sick leave is very important because home care workers should not get their clients sick. They should have enough time to recover from illnesses. Home care workers get exposed to germs as well. Most of her consumers tell her, though, when they are sick.  2    00:19:37 Favorite part of the job - taking care of her consumers. She thought she would only be in the field temporarily, but does not want to leave it now. Does want to become a CNA or a nurse someday.  00:20:27 Talks about being a grandmother. Often takes care of her three-year-old granddaughter.  00:22:07 Discusses the similarities between working for Head Start and being a caregiver.  00:22:50 How do you think you were received by legislators when you talked to them about your work? Rhonda told them about her consumer who had to panhandle on the corner for money in a wheelchair, and they were moved by the story.  00:24:31 The future of the field - Thinks that the work should continue. “Caregiving is a field that will never go away.” It's sad that consumers sometimes have a hard time getting hours. Thinks that there are a lot of people out there who do not know that they can go into caregiving and receive union benefits. “People just need to know what's out there and we can probably get more caregivers that want to do the caregiving.”  00:26:36 Thinks that the “average person” in the community does not always understand what a caregiver does, but once she explains the work, they get it. Many people ask, “How come we don't get the kind of pay you guys get?”  00:27:43 Describes working as a PSW for someone whom she has known for 20 years. He asked her, “How come you're treating me like this? We're friends.” She explained that there are rules associated with the job. Also describes strategies that help her interact effectively with her consumer.  00:31:33 End of interview.  3

Rebecca Sandoval interview, 2014-12-16 : interview conducted by Michael  Robert Bussel and Sonia De La Cruz  INTERVIEW LOG 00:00:13: Lives in Medford, Oregon. Born 1957 in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. Has lived in Oregon since 2007 and has been a caregiver since she moved to Oregon. 00:01:23: Companion’s grandmother was first person she cared for. Didn’t know that Oregon had program that would allow her to be paid as caregiver. Companion had stroke on same day grandmother died. Since then, she has cared for her. Had not planned to be caregiver, life brought her there. 00:03:15: Other jobs: retail, construction, cab driver, pest control. Attended college but did not complete her degree. 00:04:00: No time off or end of day as caregiver. Always on. “It’s my job to take care of my best friend.” Extremely rewarding. 00:05:13: In my nature to do this work. Oldest of five children. Taking care of people fundamentally who I am and who I was born to be. 00:07:25: Must give up your ego. Doesn’t help to be combative. Can’t be in control all of the time. Anticipate consumer’s needs. Recognize they are the boss. 00:09:06: Boundaries with clients can be nebulous. Must negotiate on daily basis. Must be special kind of person to be caregiver. Must be nurturing person. Able to cook and clean well, track blood sugar, take blood pressure, understand medical history. Learn as you go. Must be absorbent and kind. 00:11:30: Give each other tips as caregivers. Learning curve with elderly consumer. Incredibly good classes from home care commission. Learn tricks to distract someone’s attention from other caregivers. Have client hold something and occupy their hands while changing them. Do things with as few movements as possible. Keep supplies nearby. Anticipate and think ahead. 1  00:15:14: Typical day: get up around 9:30 or 10:00 am. Breathing treatment, check blood sugar, pills, breakfast, get dressed. Sometimes doctor's appointments, then dinner, laundry, shower. Whatever she needs for the day. Needs help toileting, night time meds. 00:17:35: When traveling, brings another person to help. Lots of work but it works out. Not much down time. Does union work during respites. 00:18:39: Not many opportunities to hang out with other caregivers. Big-hearted people. Fight for consumers and fellow workers. Union brings them together. 00:21:10: Interfacing with Division of Human Services, brokerage agencies over hours. Changes for those who work with developmentally disabled. 00:23:58: Stress on job. Can’t just go do something when you want to. Defining boundaries with consumers is stressful. 00:28:18: Clients can fire caregivers for no reason. No just cause in this relationship. 00:30:17: Humor makes situations bearable. 00:32:49: Most gratifying: nothing more noble than making it possible for people to have the lives they want to have and stay in their own homes. Most challenging: working with system, having only 2-3 hours sleep at a time. Compensation does not fully cover all the work she does. 00:35:26: Hours taken away after consumer. Did not fall for three months, a result of good job she was doing. Then subsequent falls occurred. Limiting hours devalues her. Annual assessment of appropriate care level. Feels like piecework but not adequately rewarded. Re-evaluation on how hours are allocated. State has equal interest on other side of bargaining table. 00:39:58: Pause for equipment check. 00:40:28: Talks about union. Before union: no minimum wage, independent contractor status, no workers’ compensation, no insurance. With union: $13/hour, now bona fide workers in every sense of the word. 00:42:42: Pause. 00:43:05: Union makes caregiving a job worth having. Prestige with pay and benefits. Get health insurance through co-op and Affordable Care Act (ACA). ACA helps take insurance off the bargaining table as an issue. 2  00:45:55: Career pathways for home care workers. On cutting edge in Oregon. Home care workers have closest access to consumer. Providing gloves important. 00:47:55: Asked to speak to legislators in Connecticut. Told that her testimony impacted a key legislator. No new nursing homes in Oregon in 20 years. Saves lots of money for state. No more basic freedom than choosing where you live. 00:52:57: Profession of health care is honorable, dignified. Some people don’t recognize that. 00:54:30: Caregiving a lot like being a parent. Parents don’t take sick days. Hard for caregivers to take sick days. Must push through it. Consumers still have needs. 00:57:03: Off work: likes television, movies. Union is her “hobby.” Goes to coast, likes to read. 00:58:44: Importance of caregiving to individual, society, and the state. Amazing program I intend to keep fighting for. 00:59:38: end of interview. 3

Penny Wicklander interview, 2015-05-05 : interview conducted by Michael  Robert Bussel and Donald Eugene Stacy  INTERVIEW LOG 00:00:27: Lives in Pendleton, Oregon. Born in 1946 in Portland, Oregon. Has been a phlebotomist, managed an apartment complex for low-income senior citizens. Felt “like God sent me” to do this work. Always felt good working with older people and people in need. 00:02:08: Has been a caregiver for the last six-seven years. Cared for her son who had Lou Gehrig’s disease. Has worked with a few men and with one person who had a traumatic brain injury. Current client is 86-years-old and Penny has known her for a long time. 00:03:40: Always taking care of somebody: in-laws, parents. Felt need to be helpful. Something I love to do. 00:05:03: Has conducted orientation sessions for caregivers. Tells them you have to care. Go into it with your heart open and do the best you can. 00:07:04: Intuitive person: feels other people’s feelings. Need to be in tune with your client. Can’t make older people do something. Hard part: letting them make choices for themselves. 00:09:20: Has a saying: “the complacent die young.” Have to think about this as a caregiver. 00:10:20: Wants people to do the work because they want to, not because they have to. 00:11:09: Typical workday includes bathing. Client loves to talk. They laugh so much. Important to find things in common. Fix meals, lay out pills, take care of bathroom needs, getting dressed. Looks up pets on You Tube. Important to give clients things to do so they are just not sitting around. Companionship important. 00:15:48: Watching people pass away is hard. Tells current client she loves her. Client called and had fallen. Spent five hours with her at emergency room. Didn’t get paid for this time. It’s “who I am.” A “gift God gave her.” 1  00:19:22: Feels horrible when someone dies. People have God-given right to die with dignity. Need to be there and tell someone how much you love them. 00:23:20: Intimate tasks—need to give people respect and dignity. Saw sore on client’s bottom and gets client to take care of it. Client would not like someone else doing this with her. She and client “come from the same egg.” 00:29:43: Rural caregiving-- everybody knows everybody. Probably different in cities. Hopes it is not just a job for people. When out with client, says she is “her friend.” Client says she is her “caregiver.” 00:33:00: Humor is who I am. Likes being funny and people being funny back. Can get away with more. Clients laughs at getting lifted. Need to engage with them at all times. Brain needs work, not just legs. 00:35:15: Affect people’s lives in short amount of time. Don’t know about someone else’s life. May save a life by being kind. 00:36:50: Bring joy into someone’s life when they are dying or declining. Make them feel a little better. Most rewarding to see. Still, you know they will die. 00:38:06: Has seen much death. Hard but you go back to choice and free will. When you are done, God takes you. 00:39:08: Comes from union family. Father-in-law, son involved. 00:41:10: Job steward and on bargaining team. No raises for six years. Went from $10:80/hour to $13:00 and now up to $13.75. Caregivers have told her they now don’t have to rely on food stamps. Better life. Bring the bottom up. CAPE provides voluntary political contributions. Gave her support that allowed her to speak with legislators. People in rural areas don’t understand politics. Have to be able to compete with big business and big money. 00:44:05: Spoke to legislators about paid sick leave. In Pendleton, legislator talked about sick leave as a “job killer.” 00:46:17: Knows we have to balance but not on poor or those who can’t care for themselves. 2  00:48:05: Love and caring, consideration and dignity most important to me. Not all value elderly. Exciting to hear older people talk about themselves. It’s like history. Told client “I know you better than you do.” 00:49:45: Some clients’ families not involved with parent. Important to take client to see her sister when her daughter wasn’t able to. “Why wouldn’t I do it for her?” 00:51:50: Non-work time: has six acres of land with lambs, sheep, horses. Boathouse in eastern Oregon, helps son who has traumatic brain injury. 00:53:34: If you see that someone needs love, give it to them. We are all worth something. Accept good in people and do not judge. 00:55:27: Next ten years there will be 34 percent increase in need for in home caregivers. Where will we find them? Has seen institutions and for-profits and doesn’t like them. 00:56:54: End of interview. 3    
TakingCare;Olga Yakimchuk;xxxx;2015;Taking Care--Documenting the Occupational Culture of Home Care Workers  Archie Green Fellows Project, 2014-2015  (AFC 2014/021: 01880)  Archive of Folk Culture, American Folklife Center, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.      Tom Wilson interview, 2015-04-19 : interview conducted by Nathan J. Moore      and Donald Eugene Stacy      Olga Yakimchuk, Interview 00:23:11     INTERVIEW LOG     00:00:00 Consent to interview. Olga Yakimchuk, I live in Portland. I have been a home care worker for 15 years. I have been taking care of my husband's parents. Back in 2000, when we came from Ukraine, Home Care Workers Commission was just established. Someone suggested that these jobs existed, and I applied.     00:02:43 In Ukraine, I was a nurse in a hospital. Not a charge nurse, just a nurse.     00:03:10 Differences between the two jobs? They are very alike, because I used to work with elderly, very sick people.     00:03:54 Special skills or abilities? Of course, if someone doesn't like elderly, or don't like to be helpful won't be able to do the job.     00:04:19 Knew job already? My parents-in-law have been ill for a long time and I took care of them in my country, too. I had to find time for it. Here the government compensates me for taking care of them.     00:05:57 Difference between the hospital and home care work? Yes, these are your parents, or parents-in-law. Patients in hospital are not blood-related.     00:07:41 Hard to separate work life/home life? Yes, of course it is difficult. They are always there waiting for me to come. I go three times a day, before breakfast, at lunch, and later in the evening. It takes a lot of time, but I do the best I can. Incorporate their activities into their activities? Yes. 1 00:09:54 How handle intimate tasks like bathing? I keep a picture in my mind of how my parents had to bath and clean us. This helps me when I have to do these tasks. 00:11:05 Story? Taking care of elderly is very gratifying. God rewards you. When they are in the hospital, for example, you do everything to make them comfortable. 00:12:09 What is rewarding? They are so happy to see me. When I arrive they say "My sun came out!" 00:13:09 Challenging? When they are sick, for example, my female client has problems with her hearing. We go to the doctor, some things help for a while and then not so much. You find yourself awake at night thinking, "what else can I do to help them?" 00:14:20 Union? Yes, all the meetings and classes. At first I didn't do all of the tasks correctly. Yes, it was written, but you understand much more when it is demonstrated. We all know about our rights, we went to Salem in 2013, lots of us attending. Wearing purple? Yes. 00:15:57 Something you would say to someone who doesn't know about home care work? Taking care of elderly is very noble. 00:17:10 I always feel it our duty to help elderly, and when you run out of strength, you ask for strength from God. God just help us get through today. For example--Grandfather was very sick, many surgeries, hours and hours waiting in clinics. You ask God to give you strength. 00:18:33 Sense of humor important? I have a good sense of humor, always try to encourage them, support them as much as I can with it. I say to them "say thanks to god that you are still walking"! I comfort them. 00:19:32 Hobbies or other things to re-energize? I have four children, 3 are married and one 17 years old, and 5 grandchildren. 00:20:54 What kind of person would you hire as a home care person - what qualities? Honest person, not a cheat or thief, not a smoker. And of course, do they have skills? Did they go through the trainings, I think this is a necessity. You learn a lot in the trainings, like CPR. I go about six times a year. When the Home Care Commission started, it was only giving classes in English, but now in Russian, also. They are very good.     00:23:10 End of interview.     2     
TakingCare; Olena Kryuchenko;xxxx;2015;Taking Care--Documenting the Occupational Culture of Home Care Workers   Archie Green Fellows Project, 2014-2015   (AFC 2014/021: 01721)   Archive of Folk Culture, American Folklife Center, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.   Olena Kryuchenko interview, 2015-03-07 : interview conducted by Sonia De   La Cruz and Helen Marie Moss   PART 1: 00:03:33  INTERVIEW LOG  00:00:00 Consents to interview. Olena Kryuchenko, lives in Beaverton, Oregon. Other jobs? In Kiev was chemical engineer.  00:01:22 I have been doing home care work for five years. I started with elderly female clients, one male client. I now have a younger client, disabled after a car accident  and an older woman, also disabled in a car accident.  00:03:05 How decided to become a home care worker? When I first came to this country I studied English at PCC [Portland Community College]. No work then, offered a job doing relief for another home care worker who could not work. (Process question from interpreter: should she translate simultaneously or wait for the answer, which slows down process? She was instructed to wait for the answer so the audio recording would be clear.)  00:03:33 End of Part 1  PART 2: 00:25:57  00:00:00 (Interpreting the process question and answer)  00:00:50 Anything else on how you got started? No, started working in home care, just like any other job, rewarding.  00:01:35 How is it different? Responsible for many things. I am everything to them.  00:02:19 Special skills? You have to have a special talent, like a singer has to have a good singing voice. Very important to love people, need to be very punctual and exact - I am never late! Have to be hard worker.  1    00:03:15 How did you learn? We went to a training, the one that is held in this office. Grateful for this training, I would not have known otherwise, not even where to look.  00:04:10 Typical day? My schedule is so set out I could tell you what I am doing right down to the minute! Used to write it in a diary, then I see my days don't change at all. Describes typical day. Client lives with parents, so they cook. I help him with exercises, spend lots of time playing cards and dominoes. Never TV, but he likes music so I play piano for him. Some personal care but my job is to be with him every second, not cooking or cleaning. Thanks to him, I am learning English! Speech is slow, so I learn. This client does not speak any Russian.  00:07:53 Do you feel close to clients? Yes, and there is no other way. Have to feel close with the person. Does this cause tension when go home? No, I see them everyday. Hard to set boundaries? Do they call you? No, I never have that.  00:09:30 Intimate tasks? Yes, first time with a male client. I had a personal barrier for the first time. I would have really liked some information or training then, but none available. Life itself sorts things out. Personal philosophy is that we all need care.  00:11:10 Good story?- She was asked to substitute for another person, difficult because of language barriers, so only there for ten days, but trying really hard. Frail, elderly woman with cat, the only family she had. One month later, I was called and told that the woman had died, and that the cat would be taken to the shelter. Of course, I went and got the cat. Family jokes that she needs to pick clients with no pets.  00:13:39 Friends who are home care workers? No - all my family members have an education, they do other work - only in trainings do I meet other home care workers.  00:14:26 What do you talk about? Maybe how lucky you are with client, or how difficult it is because they are so sick.  00:15:21 Is humor important in this job? Yes. I try to have a smile on my face, bring something good to the family, workplace.  00:16:23 Most rewarding? Knowing clients are well taken care of.  00:17:22 Most challenging? There are difficulties. Working with elderly, end of life coming, some depression  or with younger people, dealing with big challenges, they can be negative.  00:19:00 Union? Very happy in union, in the last five years I have received so much help. Training, health care, 2 salary raises. There is a language barrier - I wish I could do more in union.  2    00:20:00 Lobby days? No. Would you want to? Yes, but to do that need to know language.  00:21:07 Anything you want to tell? Hard work. Not always physically, but emotionally, when a client dies it is like a part of you dies.  00:22:05 Example of a gentleman she took care of who died, she still visits his grave. Special person, WWII vet. I brought my grandchildren to listen to him and they were very interested.  00:23:00 Other interests? I love my family, two dogs, two cats. We walk a lot, go to coast.  00:24:12 You seem passionate about what you do. How many years doing this work? 5 years. How long in US? 5 years. In your work, connect with broader Russian community?  00:25:00 Lots of family is here - don't have time for more.  00:25:33 Anything else? Probably not - grateful that you are interested, it is a very interesting job.  00:25:57 End of interview.  3

Neftali Garcia interview, 2015-06-18 : interview conducted by Michael Robert   Bussel and Sonia De La Cruz   INTERVIEW LOG  00:01:02: Name is Neftali Garcia. Lives in Salem, Oregon. Born in south of Mexico in state of Oaxaca in 1961.  00:02:01: Has worked in fields, attended a school for teachers, worked fourteen years in mountains of his state. Son born with difficulties and prompted him to migrate to obtain more resources. In United States, has worked in agriculture, housekeeping, production, woodworking, canneries. Settled legal status four years ago. Has worked most recently in Woodburn School District as teacher’s assistant. Likes this work.  00:04:40: Four years as a home care provider, mostly working with those who are hard of hearing or deaf. Son is deaf. In Mexico, could not find schools. Rural areas did not have this kind of help. Mixtecs major immigrants from his area. Often have least resources.  00:08:27: Wanted to help his child. Father came to United States as bracero. Encouraged him to study and didn’t want him to come to United States. Work was very hard. Father initiated documentation process for family. Goal was to help his son.  00:10:40: Very hard after first coming to United States. No idea where we were...new language, new culture. Found some good doctors including one who didn’t charge us. Financial burden after using hospital. Shared living quarters. No vehicle. Very sad, very hard.  00:13:02: Still believes this country is very generous. Determined to get resources but didn’t know how to access them. Difficulty.... community not always accepting of children with disabilities.  1    00:15:20: Things changing in contacts with church and government. Taught us a lot and allowed us to help others. Cared for others before with his wife on a voluntary basis.  00:17:12: No resources. Established community group called “Together We Can” with other Latinos. Began with four families. Similar to a union. Group became very large. Helped you feel like you could have a child with a disability and not be different.  00:19:48: Without legal status wasn’t stable. No other options... couldn’t get help. Not only my case but also case of other families. Without status, cannot receive resources.  00:21:59: Qualities for being a caregiver: be someone who is caring, person who has love for other people, necessary and basic. These are often things people with disabilities do not receive. Have love, be passionate, have respect for other people.  00:24:05: Father naturally knows what a child needs. At first, new at it and didn’t know what to do. Others became his teachers. First lesson: to have disability does not mean you are from another planet or universe. If you don’t have this belief, caregiving will not work.  00:27:00: Latino culture where he lived in Mexico asked why God was punishing you for giving you child with disability. Made you feel unworthy.  00:28:21: Understood child had need to communicate. Wife and I learned sign language at school in Salem and at school for deaf, also at classes held in church. Now my second language is sign language.  00:31:54: Came to United States for dream of helping my child. Not just to earn money or goods but to help my child and I have realized this dream. That is my American Dream. Priority not to make money but to help my son.  2    00:34:00: Hard in Mexico when I saw children who were deaf and did not have hearing aids. Make me mad I can’t help. Feels like kids have been abandoned.  00:37:37: Had routine with child from first day he was born. Made up our own signs. Help him shower, get dressed, do homework. Still have routines today. Lock doors, cook for yourself. Regimented, structured, basic thing we need to have. How we are going to work together and integrate him into the community.  00:40:29: Without support, you don’t grow.  00:41:16: Four families initially formed support group. Group grew bigger by word of mouth. Some fundraising through a woman from Eugene. She taught many lessons. Group admired her strength.  00:44:55: Started meeting in people’s homes, then churches, then had an office. Space helped serve their needs. Part of group called “Parents and Policymakers.” Parents whose children had disabilities. Help with discrimination. Showed people how to become legal guardians.  00:48:28: Learned how to navigate school system. Learned about union. Networking group. Built directory. Could call other parents to help them navigate system. One member now working nationally.  00:51:30: Short time with union. Name says it all. Place where people feel supported. Advance, progress, help one another. All about improving resources for people with disabilities.  00:53:46: Union watching out for your back. Helps us sort out issues with agencies.  00:54:50: Has talked to policymakers and expressed his opinion. Exercising rights he has in this country. My message: people with disabilities are equal to you. Don’t want to put labels on people with disabilities.  3    00:57:13: Has felt looks, words, rejection from outsiders. Try to find equality for children with disabilities and fulfill his dream. Because of color, native language, we feel we have been rejected.  00:59:18: As provider, need lots of patience. If you get bothered, won’t be able to do your job. Must be person with this kind of skill. Must break personal barriers.  01:01:18: Must think of other person’s needs. Different to work with people who have these kinds of needs.  01:02:28: Essential to have a sense of humor. Wouldn’t feel right without it. People with disabilities don’t have the love and support they deserve. All about putting yourself in someone else’s shoes.  01:04:45: Need to treat people like human beings. My son: give him trust, love, respect. If I don’t, others won’t.  01:06:03: Satisfied when he can satisfy other people’s needs. To live it changes you.  01:07:22: Been doing this for 22 years. People ask how you do it. One day at a time. At same time other families have greater difficulties than I do. If they can do it, why can’t I?  01:09:40: Likes sports, bicycle riding. Not much down time. Social life is different. Son asks lots of questions. Life of person who has child with a disability.  01:15:15: Wants to highlight that people with disabilities are human beings. Live in country with resources. Keep pressing for equality and no discrimination against people with disabilities.  01:16:19: End of interview.  4       
TakingCare; Nargiza Turanova;xxxx;2015;Taking Care--Documenting the Occupational Culture of Home Care Workers   Archie Green Fellows Project, 2014-2015   (AFC 2014/021: 01741)   Archive of Folk Culture, American Folklife Center, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.   Nargiza Turanova interview, 2015-03-07 : interview conducted by Sonia De La   Cruz and Helen Marie Moss   Nargiza Turanova Interview 00:30:09  INTERVIEW LOG  00:00:00 Consent to interview. My name is Nargiza Turanova. I have lived in Portland for the last 9 years. Working 6 years with this client. I work mainly with sick, elderly clients.  00:01:40 What led you to be a home care worker? Always interested in this kind of work. When I came to US, I took English classes, and when my English was better, I talked to friends, did research, and found the job in home care.  00:02:38 Other jobs? First when I came here, I worked at a local hotel. I began to wonder about other jobs, including the one I have now. Always interested in this kind of work, went to internet and found this job.  00:04:15 How is home care different than other jobs? I like to work with people, the communication, and I like being helpful. I used to see elderly and think, why wouldn’t I help them?  00:05:19 Skills needed? First of all, you must know the specifics of this job, and like what you are doing before you start doing it, and it is hard work.  00:06:01 How did you learn? I learned in my own country. Lots of elderly and helpless people around the neighborhood. I would stop by the neighbors and help them, doing it out of goodwill. Did you take classes here? Yes, of course, and I keep taking the classes. And I went to the meeting in Salem. Already knew a lot? Yes, because I go online and read about my work, I want to know more about the job I am doing and how to do it right.  00:07:43 Typical day? Goes through a typical day: If they have plans, I accompany them, arrange it. A walk, a doctor appointment, shopping, lunch, bath 3x a week. Laundry. I clean, freshen up the bedroom and bath. How many clients? One, I go every day.  1    00:10:00 I am not that good at English, my client speaks Turkish, which is my language, not Russian. Have clients that don’t speak Turkish or Russian? No, that would be difficult.  00:11:04 Do you become close to the client? Yes, we have to find a common language. Hard on the rest of your life? Yes. This is my job, but I also have a family. Do you need to set boundaries? No. I am always happy to help.  00:14:25 Intimate tasks, how approach? (Explain what I mean by intimate, bathing, toilet.) Always do with an open heart, I do whatever is in their interest to never hurt or harm them. I am never repulsed or disgusted.  00:16:33 Story? My client likes music, so I find music that lifts her up, if she is in a good mood, I am in a good mood.  00:17:45 What do home care workers talk about when together? About the job, are they working or not, do I like my job or not.  00:18:50 Music important. Sense of humor important too. When my client goes to an appointment, she is an entertainment for both of us. She is really is a really good person and an entertaining person even though she is 79.  00:20:11 What is rewarding? I really find the communication and spending time together rewarding. She is a very happy person, times flies because she is a happy person.  00:21:05 Challenging? To have time with your own family and do the work. But now doing so well I don’t notice the shift back and forth between them.  00:21:58 Union? I am very happy to have the union, I feel very protected, always get answers to questions. Thank you to them  and you for being interested in us.  00:23:06 Lobby days? In 2013, went to a meeting in Salem, we talked, happy to be there.  00:24:50 One thing you want people to know about the job? Some friends of mine have very sick clients, so that they cannot take part in anything. I try and bring them the information about the union. They ask me and I share.  00:26:05 What do you do when not working? I have family, we go places, and I offer to take them to see my client. So they know where do I work and what do I do. Have you done this? Yes. How old are they? 20 and 16, and they have visited my client.  2    00:27:17 Anything else? No, you asked all the questions.  00:27:43 I am impressed that you speak Turkish and Uzbek and Russian and some English. She tells her immigration path: family from Turkey, lived in Uzbekistan, then Russia, where she went to school, then here as a refugee. At first, no English, worked with volunteers to learn, and I practiced at the hotel.  00:30:09 End of interview.  3        
TakingCare;Michael Tolman;1977;2015;Taking Care--Documenting the Occupational Culture of Home Care Workers   Archie Green Fellows Project, 2014-2015   (AFC 2014/021: 01700)   Archive of Folk Culture, American Folklife Center, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.   Michael Tolman interview, 2015-02-23 : interview conducted by Nathan J.   Moore and Donald Eugene Stacy   INTERVIEW LOG  00:00:00 Introductions. Currently a student at the University of Oregon, studying digital arts.  00:01:36 Name is Mike Tolman. Lives in Eugene, Oregon. Born 1977, in Ontario, Oregon. Moved to Pendleton, Oregon, for junior high-school and high-school. Lived in Madison, Wisconsin, for one year.  00:02:48 Has been a direct support worker for over 19 years. Started in late 1995. Currently works with a single male autistic client. Client receives services through Oregon Supported Living Program (OSLP), but lives alone in a house.  00:03:29 What led you to become a direct support worker? Had been working “regular Joe” jobs (theater, restaurant work). Graduated from high-school and moved in next to classmate who was a care provider. It paid more than previous jobs. Applied for a direct care position in Pendleton. Was earning $4.85 per hour. Quality of work was appealing  ended up staying in profession.  00:04:42 How is your current job different than previous work? You get a sense that you are doing good for the world. Internal gratification and gratification from community. “It's good for your soul.”  00:05:59 Question from Don Stacy: Have you worked in other states? Worked in a state hospital in Madison, Wisconsin. A vastly different set-up. Describes state hospital model.  00:07:54 The work in Wisconsin was very different than in Oregon. Clients did not have rights or a say in their care. Shares example of client being forced to go to the bathroom. The company that Mike works for now is very progressive. Quit job in Madison and did not return to being a care provider until moving back to Oregon.  00:10:15 Special skills/qualities needed? Anyone can learn the skills, but it takes the right kind of personality. Must have empathy, patience, willingness to learn, ability to shelve preconceived  1    notions. Must shed that part of you that casts clients as the “other.” Workers in the “medical side of things” do have to learn more skills (operating medical equipment, wheelchairs, etc.). Mike works in behavioral side of industry.  00:13:34 Discusses trainings for learning how to deal with client behaviors. Emphasis is on preventing behaviors before they happen.  00:15:48 Shares stories about working with a client for seven years who had intense medical needs. Also, talks about working with clients who communicate through non-verbal methods.  00:20:16 Relationships with clients: Mike has worked with certain clients for many years  “you can't help but get close.” It is a fine line that workers always discuss.  00:21:30 Important to constantly communicate with co-workers about your relationships with clients. Talking about it helps you to not get too close. Shares example of co-worker who got too close and had to stop working with client, but took on new role in client's life. The company does recognize that long-term staff members will have some personal connections with clients. It is allowed as long as the lines do not blur too much.  00:24:29 Typical day with autistic clients – tries to make each day similar to the last. Works in afternoon until morning. Checks paperwork, money, and med logs every day. Describes client's typical day and how he helps him deal with organization and unexpected schedule changes.  00:29:55 Discusses “structured teaching” – educational activities that help autistic clients handle transitions. Describes how “structured teaching” is applied with current client using visual images.  00:35:17 How do you approach “intimate tasks?” It all starts with the comfort level of clients. Some are more modest than others. Important to understand clients and give them as much space as you can to accommodate comfort levels. Must balance comfort levels with healthcare needs.  00:41:43 What is house culture? The sum total of personalities of everyone who works and lives in a particular house. Can be a positive or negative thing. Examples of poor house culture – workers trying new strategies outside of clients' support plans that are not positive in the long term.  00:48:17 Positive house culture involves support and ingenuity. Allows for trying new work strategies but includes discussion among workers. Support for clients is more like “cheer-leading.”  2    00:51:54 Discusses staff interactions in various house situations. Worked previously in a house with co-workers who all had similar interests and were friends outside of work. An easygoing, thoughtful, and positive house culture. Negative side – the “rumor mill.” Currently works in a house with only one staff person at a time. Interacts with co-workers only at staff meetings.  00:56:09 Comments by videographer Don Stacy about "house culture" in the house in which he worked with Mike Tolman.  00:57:08 Many people who come to work at OSLP have heard about the work from a family member or friend. Very few people respond to classified ads. People who know someone in the field are more likely to think that they can do the work.  00:58:30 Union participation? Has not been involved in union activism. Has been a rank and file union member and a manager. Made sure to not “overstep bounds” when working as a manager. Learned more about the union as a manager. You cannot do anything that will come back to harm you.  Only three union reps in a company of 200 direct support workers. Union communication has been sparse recently.  01:00:55 Has the union's presence been positive for the industry? Yes, overall. Full medical and dental up until three years ago. Also has union perks such as personal days, holiday pay, earned time off.  01:03:01 Has not spoken about the importance of direct support work in a public forum. Regrets not being able to, but it is difficult with school responsibilities. Currently participating in a letter-writing campaign. Main union steward is a “really good guy” and represents workers at public forums. However, it took so long to get positive changes in the industry that many workers have given up. Discusses positive and negative aspects of union representation. Does not think that union rallies make changes  emphasizes “face time” with legislators instead.  01:09:54 What do you do to relax? Plays music in bands. Currently in a long-term relationship. Also has pets. Learned how to deal with stress as a manager. Maintains the philosophy that “nothing is permanent.”  01:13:45 Would become a manager again, but would not become boss of friends.  01:15:38 Looking for a career change after graduation. Has been a manager and does not want to go into administration. Has enjoyed working as a direct support worker. Will always advocate for more compensation for direct support workers.  01:19:12 Has made promotional videos for his company and helped clients make a music video.  3    01:20:40 Participated in an annual benefit called “The Arts of OSLP,” which included a silent auction and live music.  01:21:30 Discusses OSLP's art center that displays clients' artwork. Was going to apply for assistant director position, but decided to finish school. Important to expose clients to arts & culture.  01:25:35 Helped a client record his own songs and put music to client's lyrics.  01:27:42 Last thoughts: there are a lot of people doing some kind of caregiving work for a living. Different job titles denote different responsibilities. Personal support workers do not have to take as many trainings as direct support professionals. Thinks the field stays underfunded because people do not realize how much training and work is involved.  01:34:14 Does not think that the typical person walking down the street knows exactly what DSPs do. Often receives “passing accolades” – example: “You are doing God's work!” Notes that workers in the industry are becoming more public about the work.  01:38:02 How do you feel about the future of the profession? It will always be around. Not too worried about the future because the kids of today are more progressive than kids in the past. Discusses his first interactions with a person with developmental disabilities.  01:45:17 End of interview.  4         
TakingCare; Michael Ryan Hohman;xxxx;2014;Taking Care--Documenting the Occupational Culture of Home Care Workers  Archie Green Fellows Project, 2014-2015  (AFC 2014/021: 01120)  Archive of Folk Culture, American Folklife Center, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.  Michael Ryan Hohman interview, 2014-10-29 : interview conducted by  Michael Robert Bussel and Sonia De La Cruz  INTERVIEW LOG 00:00:30: Ryan Hohman lives in Cottage Grove, Oregon, two years as home care worker. Has three clients, one with spinal cord injury, medication management for two other clients. 00:01:24: Took community college classes after being out of work, got job in home care right out of school. 00:02:09: Some clients have more intensive needs than others. Wait for things to do in some cases. Has household chores as well as down time. 00:03:21: Special skills: patience, desire to help, find client that fits your personality. Key is not to take things personally. 00:05:36: Medication management. Get list, ensure medications are accurate, ensure people take prescribed dosage. 00:06:26: Skills learned in school, clinicals in service meetings through employers, COMPASS program provides opportunities to interact with other home care workers. Tend to work in isolation, cut off from other workers. These meetings are good places to learn and find out about common problems. 00:08:15: Typical day: client goes to gym. Do laundry, housecleaning, other household chores. For other clients, manage pillboxes. 00:09:47: Relationships with clients and their families. Become family, build rapport, client confides in him, fill gap for people. 00:12:15: Caregivers use certain acronyms, see things regular people don’t see, must be careful about confidentiality. 1  00:13:26: Talks about getting clients to do things they might not want to do. Client must have freedom and independence to make decisions...can’t be forced to do things. Caregivers brainstorm ideas about care when they come together. 00:15:55: Offers “soft, gentle” comments when giving advice regarding client behavior. Nudges people in right direction. 00:18:01: Humor within nature of profession of home care. Easier with young client who is not likely to pass away. Must deal with things that you weigh on you physically, emotionally, mentally. See people in pain. Humor is way to survive in job. 00:19:53: Waiting around is challenge. Likes to be busy. Most gratifying part of job is seeing people improve. Has seen improvement with full-time client who is in better place emotionally. Improvement less likely with elderly clients. 00:21:28: Role of union. Union makes a difference regarding fair pay. Has progressed from being delegate to General Council to work in educating members, encouraging others to get involved in the union. 00:24:17: Union is a tool for better employment conditions, pay, benefits. Must utilize it. Union gives him focus while he is waiting on the job. Redirects energy into something positive. Union provides connections to other home care workers and opportunities to socialize. 00:26:57: Benefit of being male. Male workers often prefer male caregivers. Men in demand. Not a lot of us. No one looks down on him as male in largely female industry. 00:29:12: How you “fit in” with client is based on your personality. Nothing in common--not a good fit with client. 00:30:13: Talk with client based on what may be on television, radio. Sometimes not much conversation with client. Depends on extent to which caregiver shares similar beliefs with client. Makes it easier to talk about things. 00:31:33: What people don’t know about home care: “Nothing like you think it is, a little like what you think it is.” Like being a “secret agent.” Things you can’t talk about. 00:32:28: Misconceptions. People think you sit around all day. Disturbed by perception of people who don’t understand the work. 00:34:23: Activities away from work: Enjoy summer, riding bike, writing music, playing guitar, recording, video games, woodworking. 2  00:35:20: People should know that home care workers are underpaid and workers at facilities are often short-staff, must care for lots of clients, hard to retain people under these conditions. They have it rough. 00:37:17: If you become ill, independence is a huge thing. Might have “exit strategy” when he becomes older. 00:39:06: End of interview. 3    
TakingCare; Maleta Christian;1966;2014;Taking Care--Documenting the Occupational Culture of Home Care Workers   Archie Green Fellows Project, 2014-2015   (AFC 2014/021: 01260)   Archive of Folk Culture, American Folklife Center, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.   Maleta Christian interview, 2014-11-17 : interview conducted by Sonia De La   Cruz and Nathan J. Moore   INTERVIEW LOG  Interview Log for afc2014021_01260_sr01:  00:00:18: Name is Maleta Christian. Born 1966.  00:00:27: Has lived in Roseburg, Oregon, since birth. Loves the area.  00:00:47: Works as a personal support worker for adults with developmental and intellectual disabilities. Works one-on-one with customers.  00:01:10: Previous jobs: preschool teacher, social worker, worked for Head Start in Roseburg. Worked as a teacher/social worker at Family Development Center, which provides child abuse and neglect prevention services. Worked former jobs for almost 15 years.  00:00:46: Became a personal support worker when budget cuts eliminated previous job. Devastated at first. Initially became a receptionist for Southern Oregon Regional Brokerage (SORB), then was recruited to be a personal support worker based on ability to develop rapport with consumers.  00:02:55: Brokerage is a fiscal intermediary. Personal agents help clients with individual service plans make sure their needs are being met.  00:03:21: Caregiving is similar to being a preschool teacher. Example: lots of repetition. Different because it is more one-on-one and involves working in someone’s home.  00:03:59: Special skills/qualities needed to become a caregiver? Yes. Patience. Also, important to understand disabilities. Previous experience with children with developmental disabilities has been helpful. Has a brother with developmental disabilities and watched him grow up without services.  1    00:05:09: There are official training programs through the Home Care Commission. Trainings brought about by SEIU [Service Employees International Union]. Home care workers had trainings before personal support workers. Discusses special training on how to prevent self-injurious behavior.  00:05:52: Trainings have been very helpful.  00:06:04: No such thing as a typical day (laughing). A day with a single client might involve preparing medication and meals, scheduling. Consumers do as much care for themselves as possible. Support worker may help with getting dressed or washing hair. Some clients take longer to get the day started. Positive reinforcement and praise is important.  00:08:10: Discusses working on behavior skills. Helps with “emotional coaching,” such as breathing, relaxing, dealing with anxiety. Offers suggestions about how to deal with sadness and anger.  00:08:43: Other activities—swinging, exercising, swimming.  00:08:50: Important to maintain schedule when working with multiple consumers.

The more independent they feel, the more empowered they are.  00:09:52: Has traveled to Salem with consumers to share stories with legislators. Empowering for consumers to share their stories. She wants to go to every lobby day.  00:11:23: Important for politicians to hear consumers’ stories, especially when programs are getting cut. Budget cuts mean that consumers will have to enter foster care.  00:11:55: A bus takes people to the State Capitol. Discusses going to lobby days when she was still a receptionist.  00:12:15: No songs or chants at the lobby days. Lots of speaking and storytelling. Remembers supporting a client of SORB when she told her story at the State Capitol. Empowering to just sit and be there for her. Consumers were excited to support a peer.  00:13:40: Speaking to legislators changes consumers. Remembers consumer who got her own place, moved to a safer situation, and gained new skills  consumer frequently said, “If it wasn’t for you, I couldn’t do this.”  2    00:14:40: Acts a friend, counselor, shopper, and a liaison for customers when they visit doctors. Consumers do not always know what to say and personal support worker can step in and explain situations. Also been a liaison with attorneys.  00:15:30: Do you become close with customers? Yes, but there are boundaries. Does not go to birthday parties or family functions. Shares parenting experiences with consumers, if helpful.  00:16:10: Do you get to know their families? Yes. Works side by side with some families. Parents of current consumer happy to have someone on their team. Models behavior for families.  00:17:21: Can be very hard to maintain boundaries with consumers and families. Does not work weekends unless there is something that a consumer really wants to do. Gives the example of a consumer wanting to go to a dance, but family will not drive after dark. Will take the time to help consumer be part of a community. Depends on the situation.  00:18:12: Does not let consumers stay at her house. Will take them on trips to Wildlife Safari, parks, the YMCA.  00:19:00: Consumers do not become like family, although it is hard to maintain boundaries. Just wants to take them all home (laughing).  00:19:30: Are there words to describe the job that only home care workers would understand? Does not know. Not always an opportunity to speak with other caregivers and personal support workers.  00:19:50: Words to describe the job: rewarding, emotionally taxing, empowering. Also a learning experience  customers share knowledge, too.  00:20:29: Caregivers get together at trainings or at regional union meetings and talk about pay and healthcare. Home care workers have had health care longer than personal support workers. Personal support workers have only had healthcare for one year. Talk is also about differences and similarities in jobs and ways that both groups “de-stress.” Lots of networking.  00:22:10: Do you share jokes or funny stories? Yes—icebreakers, funny and sad stories.  00:22:35: Very important to have a sense of humor. Humor can be used to show clients and families that it is okay to be silly. Examples: silly dancing to music, splashing water. Helps when customers are feeling sad by bringing up endorphins.  3    00:23:55: Currently works about 100 hours per month with one client, which is not that much. Full-time is 160 hours per month.  00:24:10: When workers get together, they also talk about raises. Home care workers do not get paid as much as personal support workers. Wages are different, depending on the consumer, contract, and how much money is available. This can be touchy. She does not share what she makes.  00:24:51: Since joining the union, she has noticed home care workers and personal support workers working together more. More cohesive at meetings instead of “us and them.”  00:25:41: Has developed leadership skills as a union member. Works now on general council, which is run by members. Very empowering. Has been on several committees, went to the Labor Education & Research Center’s summer school. Met other union members and educated them about what home care workers and personal support workers do.  00:26:38: Challenging herself to go outside of comfort zone. Wants to be an advocate for people that cannot leave homes. Wants them to be able to stay independent.  00:27:04: Knew there were a lot of home care workers and personal support workers before the union, but not the full extent.  00:27:26: Mostly women work in the industry, but her assistant director is a man. Three or four men came to last union meeting.  00:27:50: Has not been involved in bargaining, but is going to rallies in January.  00:28:23: “We’re always in purple.” Members wear union colors at legislature, council meetings, and rallies. She wears union shirt in Roseburg. It says, “We’re here. We’re strong. And I’m proud.”  00:29:14: Hobbies: cake decorating and photography. Makes cakes for family members and friends. Listens to music and thinks about the person that the cake is for.  00:30:08: Brings hobbies to the job. Taught one consumer how to make cupcakes.  00:30:56: Hobbies help with relaxation. Allows for focusing on self and the beauty around her.  00:31:32: Has been cake decorating for four years. Took some classes. Has been doing photography since childhood. Photography brought her closer to one consumer.  4    00:33:04: Nicknames for consumers? Depends on the person. Some consumers do not appreciate being called something different. Calls a couple of consumers “my sister-girl.”  00:33:47: Has worked with consumers of all different ages, from people in their twenties to almost sixty.  00:34:03: Plans on continuing for as long as body allows and as long as there are people who want her to.  00:34:19: Rewarding to see someone who could not leave house without putting something in mouth be able to look up and out. It shows pride.  00:35:41: Anything people might find surprising about the job? Some people think she just changes diapers and feeds people. Those are just some of the things you might do to help someone be independent. People think that if you are disabled, you cannot do anything. She works to empower clients so they can do things for themselves. They are smart and just want to be independent.  00:36:57: Empowerment—it is important for everyone to have.  00:37:55: Any memory or experience that stands out? Recently had a challenge working with a consumer’s family members. Had to tell consumer that it is not okay for her mother to use her money in inappropriate ways.  00:40:05: Worked with a consumer who lost mother. Had to help her work through grief. Called consumer on her birthday to tell her, “Happy Birthday, baby girl.” Made her a cake on the anniversary of her mother’s death. Does not know what the consumer would have done without her help.  00:41:40: There are trainings for support workers to help consumers through grief, but consumers have to be ready. It is their choice. People do not always understand that it is their choice to do things. This can be empowering, but frustrating. Consumers do not always make the best choices. Example: eating a whole tube of cookie dough. Natural consequences become learning tools.  00:44:25: Using preschool teaching skills has been key to working with some adults.  00:45:18: Has a certificate of appreciation for being a union director. The experience has been great  helped her step out of comfort zone. Usually does not drive in cities and has high anxiety. Knows work will help people who cannot help themselves.  5    00:47:34: End of Part 1.  Interview log for afc2014021_01260_sr02:  00:00:05: Works primarily with women. Does not want to work in a situation in which consumer can claim sexual harassment or vice versa. Some women do not want male providers because they have been abused.  00:00:46: Usually women work with women and men work with men. There are some exceptions.  00:01:21: End of Part 2.  6       
TakingCare;Kimberly Cole;1961;2015;Taking Care--Documenting the Occupational Culture of Home Care Workers  Archie Green Fellows Project, 2014-2015  (AFC 2014/021: 02060)  Archive of Folk Culture, American Folklife Center, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.  Kimberly Cole interview, 2015-05-05 : interview conducted by Michael  Robert Bussel and Donald Eugene Stacy  INTERVIEW LOG 00:00:42: Lives in Medford, Oregon. Born 1961 in Klamath Falls, Oregon. 00:01:07: Has worked in hotels, restaurants, done child care and home care as “personal service worker.” Has done latter for past three years and for the most part cared for one person. 00:02:21: Person she cares for has hard time keeping caregivers. Disabled but lives independently. Thought it would be easy job, but has been very challenging. Didn’t know how to balance out her consumer’s stories at first. Concerned about taking her out in public. 00:04:55: People need people to be close to them. Automatically developed connection with current consumer. Others had told her it would be hard to achieve. 00:05:59: Consumer like one of her children. Wanted to see her live with dignity. Consumer does Special Olympics, goes into stores, Kim takes her places. Feels protective of her client. Must separate fact from fiction in what she says. 00:08:35: Job requires “a lot of heart.” Must be able to love that person. Kindness and understanding needed. Otherwise, won’t work. Learned on the job. 00:10:00: Every day is different. Depends on consumer’s mood. Can get dismissed by her. Works around it. Take a drive, run errands, do laundry, go for coffee or breakfast, to Goodwill. Also cleans house or “does something fun.” Lot of work. 00:11:43: Involved consumer in holidays with her family. Best friend-they are “pretty close.” Only one she can really trust. 00:14:13: Concerned how her family would react. Children took to her. Really good with kids. Never met anyone like her. Has passed the challenge...her client would never fire her. 1  00:16:21: Able to joke around. You have to...could go insane if you thought about it too much. All people with disabilities are different. At Special Olympics, consumer has her sit on sidelines. Jokes about her lack of sportsmanship. Can say “off-the-wall stuff that cracks me up.” 00:18:30: Gratifying to be there for someone. Feels good about her ability to take care of her consumer. Can’t go in and try to change their lives. Must let her be who she is. 00:21:29: Without a union, wouldn’t have gotten into the work. Had been in child care for fifteen years but didn’t know about union in home care. Later met home care providers through child care union activities. Organizer got her interested and “talked her into it.” Hadn’t voted until four years ago. 00:23:33: Has “become a whole different person.” Had been a loner. “Union brought me out.” Able to express herself about people we care for and the jobs we do. 00:24:18: Job is now important. Somebody standing behind me every day. Better pay and health care coverage a big victory. 00:26:13: Must have heart and soul to do the work. Got to be “real human” to take care of person who is not your kin. 00:27:15: Relaxes by spending time with family. Also wants to spend time with herself. Focus on having weekends off and time for herself. 00:28:16: Very rewarding work. Glad at what I do, glad to find union. Woman she cares for has made her a better person. 00:29:01: Community starting to know more about the work. Realize that people need independent living. Important that society know they are human beings—just a “little more special.” Glad that the state has such a program. 00:31:08: Important to keep funding home care. Keeps people independent, not put away. Keeps community from looking at such people as a “danger.” Makes a difference. 00:32:25: When she takes her consumer to public place, people “understand.” Has never seen people treat her consumer differently. Surprised by that. 00:33:43: End of intervie w. 2     
TakingCare; Joye Willman;xxxx;2014;Taking Care--Documenting the Occupational Culture of Home Care Workers   Archie Green Fellows Project, 2014-2015   (AFC 2014/021: 01122)   Archive of Folk Culture, American Folklife Center, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.   Joye Willman interview, 2014-10-20 : interview conducted by Helen Marie   Moss   INTERVIEW LOG  00:00:20 I agree to participate in the interview. Joye Willman lives in Portland, Oregon, been home care worker 22 years, works with all types of clients.  00:01:19 Got into it because needed flexible hours, had been around family with disabilities growing up.  00:02:17 Home care gives you a sense of self, lets you go home at night knowing you did something good, that if you weren't there they would be in a worse situation, example of client with OCD that she has helped.  00:03:36 district.  00:04:13  Other jobs - jewelry store, thrift store, sold all the normal things women sell  school  Special skills? Depends on client's need. She doesn't do colostomy bags for example.  00:05:10  big heart. Now have training, did not in the beginning. Diabetes, keeping relationships professional, safety, lifting. More safety with education.  How learn skills - were mothers first or nurturing instinct, love for people/ animals,  00:06:49 Typical duties - regular housekeeping, prepare food, take to Dr. or schedule and arrange transportation, anything they need done advocate for them with case worker.  00:08:30 Harder for seniors who used to be able to do things than for disabled. Example from past union leader Karen Thompson, who was born with one arm  thought another one would get in the way.  00:10:40 Some people don't have families, were in the Fairview Institution, severed family ties, and even forced sterilization. When came out of institution, didn't have that family nucleus, no support system. Home care worker fills in as family.  1    00:12:48 Delicate balance with family members, working as team or in hierarchy. Can create problems.  00:13:50 Boundaries? Depends on client. 99-year-old client who was quite demanding and anti-union.  00:15:25 Have to remind one client that she can't accept favors or gifts every month.  00:16:55 Stresses - two clients - each will call when I am working with the other person, complain to case worker about too many phone calls. They won't stop, now a big joke among all of them.  00:18:17 Occupational terms? Lots of union terms. Confusing acronyms, like CAPE.  00:19:30 Stories? - Story of my guy, known since 9 years old, cry when I talk about it, watched decline, when I was in abusive relationship, I thought of him (crying), wanted to thank him, now I am a caregiver for him. I'll stay with him until the end.  00:23:25 Talking with other home care workers - can be eating dinner and talking about colostomy bags - don't have a water cooler to congregate, so any time we have an event, you can't shut us up.  00:25:08 "Uber" important to have a sense of humor - one thing that got me through with 99-year-old woman, tell her a joke.  00:25:45 What attributes of job are good? Developed sense of self, was shy. Has grown, has inner energy. Was taking care of Mom in the last months of life. Home care worker peers helping her with care of Mom.  00:27:31 What is challenging? - getting everyone on the same page. Case manager, doctor, client, me, transport or, or, or.  00:28:13 Union - was union member before there was a home care worker union. Helped to create the union, history of formation of union, ballot measure 99 for home care commission, and someone to bargain with.  00:31:23 I am the only person who has been in all of the bargaining sessions, management or union.  00:31:30 Nothing in the beginning - Amazed to find out 200 home care workers just in my zip code, did not know that, invisible no more theme, didn't take out taxes, big issue.  2    00:32:38  00:34:16 would all 00:35:56  00:38:30 How relax when off work? What off work time? ha ha. Rose Society, loves beach and to read.  00:39:16 Read to clients? Not books, but documents, and ballot explanations so can make informed decision. One client doing an interview with Kate Brown, Secretary of State, about elderly and disabled.  00:40:00 A lot of seniors think they cannot vote. Interview on YouTube, and they put something in the voter's pamphlet.  00:41:13 End of interview.  $3.20 an hour, then owe taxes, no insurance or worker's comp.  First contract got this resolved, and insurance and worker's comp, they were afraid we claim worker's comp, didn't happen.  Got a raise, and last contract went to $13.00 an hour.  Talking to legislators about all the different issues, even Facebook friends with them  Harder job than people think it is, when we talk to legislature, any thing we get for us we are also benefiting consumer.  00:36:30 00:37:27  3       
TakingCare; Joyce Vegar;xxxx;2015;Taking Care--Documenting the Occupational Culture of Home Care Workers   Archie Green Fellows Project, 2014-2015   (AFC 2014/021: 01540)   Archive of Folk Culture, American Folklife Center, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.   Joyce Vegar interview, 2015-01-21 : interview conducted by Nathan J. Moore   and Donald Eugene Stacy   INTERVIEW LOG  00:07:05-00:07:23: Name is Joyce Vegar, but goes by Joy. Lives in Lakeside, Oregon. Has worked as a home care worker for 13 years.  00:07:30-00:08:12: Other jobs—fry cook, certified professional nanny for 15 years, childcare provider. Recruited to home care work by childcare co-worker.  00:08:19-00:09:24: Has worked mainly with seniors, but also with clients in the mental health system. Has done hospice work and worked with clients with Parkinson's, diabetes, and Alzheimer's. Has lived-in with clients.  00:09:30-00:10:22: Has worked exclusively on a one-on-one basis with clients. Sometimes part of a caregiving team, but only one home care worker is there at the same time. When you “live-in,” you work for a certain number of days, and then another worker takes over. Also worked in situations that are not quite “live-in,” but involves shift work. Always kept a notebook and arrived early to speak with other home care workers.  00:10:32-00:11:11: Has been on duty twice when clients passed away. Worked with one client for 20 months. She got to pass away in her bed with Joy, her dog, and her cat in the room, which was what she wanted.  00:11:31-00:13:08: Previous jobs have involved caregiving. Sees herself as a people person. It's important to know that her job makes a difference. People get to stay in their own homes, go places, do things. One client had cancer and could no longer talk. Joy would get her out of apartment and take her for drives. Sometimes did this on her own time without pay.  00:13:20-00:14:37: Can anyone do this work? Yes, but not everyone can do it well. You have to have compassion and like people. You should not be a home care worker if you remain uninvolved and disconnected with clients. Don't have to be bosom buddies with clients, but you have to care for them. You have to be willing to roll up your sleeves and get dirty.  1    00:14:56-00:16:33: How do you learn the job? There are training programs now, but not when she entered the field. There used to be just a basic orientation. Got lucky with first client — a stroke victim whose wife was a former CNA (certified nursing assistant). Learned a lot of skills from her. Now there are good paid trainings on a variety of subjects that workers can access through the Oregon Home Care Commission. Important to keep learning.  00:16:41-00:17:49: Does get close to clients, some more than others. Has become close to some of the families. Also has been a care giver for members of the same family. Works closely with family members when caring clients with Alzheimer's and dementia.  00:18:03-00:19:55: Emotional relationships with clients can be stressful, especially when someone passes away. Being a Christian helps. Often prays at work when things are going wrong. People with dementia often “lose their filters” and yell at caregivers. Going for a walk in nature helps.  00:19:58-00:20:37: On two separate occasions, the person who was supposed to relieve her did not arrive. Ended up working thirteen straight days with no help. Dealt with it by going outside for small periods of time.  00:20:47-00:23:00: Has been a first responder for people in emergency situations, sometimes in the middle of the night. There are times you work on your days off because there is no one else available. Flexibility is important, but does like to have a general idea of what the client needs. Usually, there's a task list to follow, but it's not always possible to stick to it.  00:23:03-00:25:30: Has a twenty-two-year-old daughter, who was ten when Joy started home care work. When a client broke her hip and locked herself in her house, Joy's daughter climbed through the window and opened the door. She was a hero.  00:26:23-00:28:35: Is there a typical day in home care work? Yes and no. Depends on the task list. Some jobs involve only cleaning, others involve meal prep, activities, etc. Almost always has more than one client at a time. Currently has six clients and carries out a variety of tasks— housekeeping, cleaning, and even takes one client out to dinner.  00:28:41-00:29:40: Likes the variety and being around different people. Works with three different clients on Tuesdays. Very busy.  00:29:48-00:30:32: What do you talk about with clients? Anything and everything. Doesn't talk about her faith unless client is a Christian and brings it up. Talks about families, dogs, interesting things that have happened, news items. You talk like you would talk to a friend.  2    00:31:34-37:02: Any specific stories that illustrate what being a caregiver is like? Yes. Lived part of the week with a client and shared duties with another less experienced home care provider. Client experienced a medical emergency and the other caregiver called the fire department. Joy arrived, got into bed behind client, put her hands on his shoulders, and told him to breathe. Client calmed down and did not have to be transported. Did what had to be done in that situation. Another client was developing a pressure sore from sitting in a recliner. Went to her house at two in the morning every morning and switched the pillow. Learned a lesson after messing up her own sleep schedule — just because you can do something doesn't mean you should.  00:37:13-00:39:15: Experience helps home care workers know what to look for on the job. Caregivers are always on the look out for things like pressure sores.  00:39:18-00:41:18: Humor is very important. Part of Joy's philosophy — you can laugh or you can cry and laughing is more fun. Sometimes things are genuinely funny. Tells story of cat jumping on her while helping client in the bathroom. Some clients like to laugh more than others.  00:41:24-00:44:23: Currently serves as home care council director for Coos and Curry Counties. Attends meetings at labor hall in Coos County and travels to Gold Beach for Curry County meetings. Very active in the union. Also serves on three committees. Getting together with other union members is really helpful. There aren't other people at the work site, so it's nice to talk about your day, experiences, get advice. Helps you realize that you are not the only one who has experienced things like clients refusing to take medicine or take a bath. It's nice to be in a room where everyone thinks that your job has value.  00:44:38:-00:45:53: Caregiver talk—outsiders might not understand acronyms like PSW (personal support workers). Caregivers talk about things that non-caregivers don't normally discuss — anatomy, giving baths, catheter care, etc.  00:46:47-00:48:50: Learns best through hands-on experience. Tells clients that they will have repeat things in the beginning. Also learns by making notes to self. Lots to remember with six clients. Not currently cooking for any clients.  00:48:58-00:50:18: Has the union made a difference in your work? Yes. When first started, there was no workers' compensation. Was always worried about tripping or hurting self. Now has paid time-off and health insurance. Has high blood pressure and allergies and medications are covered. Nice to be able to see the doctor, especially when dealing with women's and age-related health issues.  3    00:50:20-00:51:20: Has traveled to the Oregon State Capitol (in Salem, Oregon) for lobby days. Doesn't just advocate for self  advocates for clients too. Important to share stories with lawmakers. Remembers a client being asked, “What does your home care worker mean to you?” He responded, “It means I get to keep my feet.” He was insulin-dependent and couldn't put on support hose. Home care workers put it on for him. “I defy anyone to hear a story like that and not think that the program needs to be funded.”  00:51:21-00:52:15: The SEIU [Service Employees International Union] care provider umbrella includes home care workers, personal support workers, childcare workers, nursing home workers, and workers in adult foster homes. If everyone who receives home care support goes to nursing homes, what will we do with the people who need to be there? We don't have the money and bed space for everyone. It costs taxpayers a lot less to have Joy go in for a few hours a day than it does to put people in 24- our facilities.  00:52:19-00:52:49: Has not testified in a legislative session, but has talked to individual legislators. Will be talking with local legislators at an upcoming town hall meeting.  00:52:53-00:54:14: Some home care workers take clients to lobby days, but Joy's clients don't travel well. Home care workers wear purple union colors on trips. Currently, has a union t-shirt, vest, and jacket. Was in Mexico several years ago and was amused that her cosmetic kit, day-trip bag, and purse all had SEIU logos on them.  00:54:19-00:54:32: At the lobby days, if there is a big gathering, someone will start chanting, SEIU!, SEIU! (with clapping on the beats). Everyone joins in.  00:54:45-00:55:38: All wear purple so legislators will see them. If one person says that something needs to change, politicians will think about it. If a sea of purple shows up and says, “We really think you should fund this program,” it's hard to ignore it.  00:56:12-00:56:57: Discussion of various SEIU colors. Don Stacy (videographer) notes that his SEIU union local wears red. Joy: it's important that each sector of the union has an individual identity as well as a collective identity. Discussion between Nathan and Joy about what the term “home care worker” means and how it is often applied to multiple jobs.  00:57:05-00:59:40: How does the community view home care work? Some people are aware of what home care workers do, but a lot are not. One third of Curry County's population is 65 or older. One-quarter to one-fifth of Coos County's population is 65 or older. A lot of people need help or will need it in the future. They are part of the community and should be taken care of. It's part of the covenant we make with workers in the U.S. If you work hard all your life, you should be able to retire and be cared for. If we don't do this, we're letting people down. There are other cultures that revere their elderly and we can learn from them.  4    00:59:49-01:00:09: Works with male and female clients. It depends mostly on personality.  01:00:14:-01:00:35: Hobbies — walking, reading, watching movies and television, going for drives, talking to people. Active in the Hauser Community Church.  01:01:48:-01:02:38: Something surprising about home care work? The organizational part. Helping people with memory issues involves booking appointments, taking them to physical therapy, filling the medicine box. People don't know that home care workers “make the whole place run.”  01:02:56-01:04:17: Sometimes has to make necessary changes in a client's life. Tells story of client who threatened another caregiver with a kitchen knife. Joy made the decision to move knives to a safer place. Calls this “living-proofing the environment.”  01:01:32-01:05:32: Plans on doing this work as long as physically able. May transition to more specialized work that doesn't involve as much physical exertion.  01:05:40-01:08:58: Discusses Harris v. Quinn, a court case in Illinois. Any home care worker knows about it. The Supreme Court coined a brand new phrase: fully-fledged state worker. The Court said home care workers are not fully-fledged and entitled to certain benefits. Impacted SEIU in Oregon. Union stopped collecting fair share dues from non-members that still benefited from collective bargaining. Likens it to hooking up to the neighbor's cable. Everyone should help pay. Very offended by the idea that home care workers are not fully-fledged state workers. Considers it a civil rights issue. It will be an ongoing fight and SEIU may not win. Public unions are the last strongholds of unionism in the U.S. Unions don't mean what they used to mean. Union didn't used to be a dirty word. Going to a union meeting wasn't something that you had to do on the sly. Middle class is vanishing so that people at the top can make more money.  01:09:00-01:09:52: Father was a union carpenter, owns his home. Joy lives in a mobile home that's falling apart. Not sure how it can be replaced. We need to take care of the care providers.  01:10:09-01:13:10: Frustrated about not being a fully-fledged state worker. Receives pay voucher from a state office, paycheck says “State of Oregon” on it. Also does the union orientation for Coos and Curry Counties in state buildings. Why suddenly a second-class citizen? Works on SEIU's civil and human rights committee. An African-American committee member reminded Joy that social security originally excluded domestic and agricultural workers. Why? Because they were non-whites. Do we really want to go back to differentiating between the value of workers on the basis of what they do or the color of their skin? Home care workers are one of the most diverse work populations because people who need care come in all shapes, colors, and sizes.  5    01:14:40-01:16:42: Question from Don Stacy: How do you feel about the recent push for $15/hour in industries like fast food? How do you feel about home care administrators who say that they can't pay workers that amount? Joy supports anyone who can get $15/hour because a rising tide floats all boats. The heads of corporations need to re-examine what the phrase “can afford” means. Discusses the difference between heads of corporations affording luxury vacations and workers making choices between food and medication. Talks about being a single mother and trying to make ends meet.  01:16:52-01:17:02: Notes that many home care workers keep working past retirement age. Knows home care workers in their seventies or older because they can't afford to retire.  01:18:11-01:21:30: Example of the importance of home care work. Imagine being in a Wal-Mart or walking down the street. Think about everyone you see who is over 65 and imagine all of them not being there anymore. They are our bridges to the past. We need to respect that. Discusses her father and all of the buildings that he helped build. He deserves to be taken care of in his old age. Also talks about mother's struggles with dementia and not being able to have a home care worker.  01:22:47-01:24:26: Talks about how home care workers can contribute to decision making on health care policies and senior programs. Home care workers have experience and common sense. Gives example based on former client's experiences.  01:26:39-01:29:00: Home care workers at risk for occupational injuries and sexual harassment. Having status and stature provides protection. There is a need for a group setting in which home care workers can share their experiences and receive support.  01:30:30: End of interview.  6

TakingCare;Eileen Ordway;xxxx;2015;Taking Care--Documenting the Occupational Culture of Home Care Workers  Archie Green Fellows Project, 2014-2015  (AFC 2014/021: 02024)  Archive of Folk Culture, American Folklife Center, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.  Eileen Ordway interview, 2015-05-26 : interview conducted by Nathan J.  Moore and Donald Eugene Stacy  INTERVIEW LOG 00:00:30 Name is Eileen Ordway. Lives in Springfield, Oregon. 00:00:43 Has been a home care worker since 2008 with Senior & Disabled Services. Has also worked in assisted living facilities. 00:01:10 Works mostly with seniors and people with disabilities. Most of the seniors have been over 65. 00:01:32 Other jobs - assembling thermostats, worked as a cashier in the fast food and retail industries. 00:02:07 What led you to become a caregiver? Separated from partner in 2007 and needed a job. 00:02:38 Caregiving is more intense than previous jobs because it involves other human beings. The goal is to establish “well-rounded connections” with individuals. Her previous jobs have focused on making sales. People are vulnerable and anxious in the home care industry because they have lost independence and are struggling to adapt to illnesses. 00:04:07 Do you need special skills? You need patience. People who are adjusting to new circumstances can be harsh. They are seeking control because everything else in their lives is controlled by doctors. Compassion is also needed. 00:06:38 Home care workers should not take it personally when consumer-employers are short with them. She tries to picture herself in their shoes. 00:07:20 Has attended training programs offered by the Home Care Commission. Also earned a Master's degree in Business with a concentration in Health Care Administration. Likes knowing how people think so she can adapt to various situations. 1  00:08:38 Typical work day? There is no typical work day. Outside factors affect each day. One of her current consumer-employers is paralyzed from waist down and needs help with the basics (getting dressed, bathing, grooming, etc.). Also works with a woman whose husband is dying, and she needs emotional support. 00:12:00 She does become close to consumer-employers. Shares many life experiences with one of her current consumer-employers. Gives examples and talks about this relationship in detail. 00:15:57 Often meets family members of her consumer-employers. Became good friends with the husband of one of her clients. 00:17:22 Maintaining a professional relationship and giving consumer-employers what they need is not an easy balance. “I walk a tightrope of providing assistance and providing support in all areas. But I have to have a small amount of my own self that's a little distant.” 00:19:07 What do you do to relax? Likes to read, hike, go bowling, watch TV with her family. 00:20:17 Works roughly 80 hours per month. 00:20:32 Deals with intimate tasks in a way that conveys respect for individual autonomy. Discusses carrying out intimate tasks for a consumer-employer with paralysis. 00:22:03 Specific moments that capture the essence of being a caregiver - Discusses a consumer-employer who passed away and how her husband knew he did the thing by not putting her in a facility. Understands the need for assisted living centers and nursing homes, but does not think that they employ enough staff. Thinks that facilities are “looking at the bottom line.” 00:25:30 Discusses her ideas pertaining to health care reform. Thinks that the medical system focuses too much on prescribing medications and not enough on systemic solution. 00:28:26 Gets together with other home care workers at regional union meetings and at “lobby days.” Looking forward to an upcoming picnic sponsored by SEIU [Service Employees International Union]. Wants to help providers in a two- to four-block radius connect with each other. 00:29:54 Talks about how it is easy to feel isolated as a home care worker. Consumer-employers may lack social networks. Home care workers also have atypical work schedules due to consumer-employer needs. 2  00:31:45 What do caregivers talk about when they get together? They try to relieve stress and answer questions about union benefits. They also discuss their own health difficulties. A lot of health care providers are aging and others are experiencing work-related health issues. There is a common misconception that home care workers are domestic servants. She believes that this perception will change when people involved in long term care become more connected to each other. 00:36:30 Humor on the job - “A sense of humor helps a person see a silver lining in a day that can be very difficult.” Talks about being able to use humor with her clients. Important to understand what consumer-employers find funny. 00:37:37 The most gratifying part of the job - knowing that she is assisting someone with a sense of connection and belonging. 00:38:48 The most challenging part - adapting and adjusting to the various needs of consumer-employers. 00:39:40 Being a union member has made a positive impact on her life. Describes the differences between working as a unionized home care worker and working in non-union assisted living facilities. The non-union facilities did not have enough staff, which led to unsafe situations. Believes that she has an obligation as a worker to help shape the industry. 00:44:37 Has spoken about her work at the State Capitol as part of a statewide campaign for paid sick leave days. 00:45:51 Has spoken in legislators' offices and enjoys the political nature of the union's work. 00:46:33 Discusses what the union does at “lobby days.” Currently, the focus is on the “fair shot agenda,” which emphasizes that home care workers are advocating for others in the community, who need paid sick leave, retirement security, etc. Talks about the precarious retirement situations of many home care workers, who cannot generate enough work credits for social security. Also describes potential mechanisms for alleviating the problem. 00:55:22 Works with both men and women. 00:55:44 What is one thing that people might not know about your job? “What they probably don't know is that they can make the difference between the consumer-employer being part of the community or the consumer-employer living in the community and having no sense of belonging.” 3  00:58:33 End of interview.00:43:05: Union makes caregiving a job worth having. Prestige with pay and benefits. Get health insurance through co-op and Affordable Care Act (ACA). ACA helps take insurance off the bargaining table as an issue. 00:45:55: Career pathways for home care workers. On cutting edge in Oregon. Home care workers have closest access to consumer. Providing gloves important. 00:47:55: Asked to speak to legislators in Connecticut. Told that her testimony impacted a key legislator. No new nursing homes in Oregon in 20 years. Saves lots of money for state. No more basic freedom than choosing where you live. 00:52:57: Profession of health care is honorable, dignified. Some people don’t recognize that. 00:54:30: Caregiving a lot like being a parent. Parents don’t take sick days. Hard for caregivers to take sick days. Must push through it. Consumers still have needs. 00:57:03: Off work: likes television, movies. Union is her “hobby.” Goes to coast, likes to read. 00:58:44: Importance of caregiving to individual, society, and the state. Amazing program I intend to keep fighting for. 00:59:38: end of interview. 4

Has been a forensic nurse. Also served in the military. 00:02:58: Most recently, got into home care through his wife. She is group leader for a client they serve. Majority of his time is spent as umpire, referee, and sports entrepreneur. Home care is convenient for his schedule and allows him to diversify things he does in his life. 00:03:57: Empathetic person. Caregiver for his mother. Window of opportunity to take care of client and have flexible work schedule. Came into field in Oregon at a time when pay raises occurred. 00:05:10: Previously cared for elderly man, who had suffered severe stroke and had to be lifted. Needed strength and flexibility to lift him. Job involved medical protocol, hospice protocol, functional protocol. Food had to be pureed and strained. 00:07:05: Current client is a paraplegic. Job requirements change. Pick up different skills. Monitor IVs. Colostomy and ileostomy bags must be emptied. Wound care monitoring. Sanitation and disease prevention. Work around clock as a team. Laundry must be done in a special manner. 00:09:12: Client is aware and has a personality. Must be counselor, psychologist. Fun to interact with client. Caregiver is an extension of client’s disabilities. 00:12:43: Draws on his experience as a coach and referee. Challenge to keep a balance. It is both “interesting” and “tough.” 1  00:13:27: Must be a good listener. Open to different views. If you and your client differ on politics, must learn to accommodate each other. 00:14:30: Important to remember that as caregiver, you are in another person’s home. Must respect that. 00:15:35: Marine Corps background useful. “Yes sir, no sir,” "do it your way." in dealing with client. 00:16:18: Bus rides a nightmare with client. Client can get distressed by little things. 00:17:52: Client often feels her rights are violated when traveling on bus. Makes a deal with her at bus stops. Gets on first, sizes up situation to make sure she will be comfortable once she boards. Option: catch next bus or walk. Caregivers must make accommodation. 00:19:13: Establish routine. Help client feel in control. Introduced client to Facebook. Got her a Christmas tree. Importance of little things. Go to restaurants, movies, ball games. Client hadn’t done this in years. Expand interpersonal relationship and understand her better. 00:21:34: No conversation about future goals, although latent skills are there. 00:22:54: As caregiver, don’t know what family dynamics will be. Family “interviews” you. Must develop positive relationship with them. 00:24:47: If you don’t mesh with client, move on. Caregiver works at pleasure of client. Relationship can get strong. Become part of extended family. Invited client to family events. Not a job where you take weekends or holidays off. 00:26:23: Industry will balloon. People will want to stay in their homes. 00:27:45: Developed a “team concept” with their client. Added folks they knew to the team. Developed a log book. 00:30:04: Team concept build around scheduling, cooperation, sharing of information. His role is to do washing, vacuuming, day-to-day routine care. 00:31:19: Home care does not generally have a team concept. Can call in co-workers to fill in, if you are sick. 00:32:30: Asked if he would run for office by union and became district officer. Involved in phone calls, answering questions, coordination of effort. Union builds and develops home care 2  workers. A “maid” does not put IVs in you. Home care as a classification will expand and require accreditation. 00:35:23: Importance of knowing history of what has happened with client. Daily log book notes good days, bad days for client. 00:37:27: Folks want to know how to do the right thing for people in distress. Home care worker might come to resemble an LPN or CNA at some point. 00:40:10: Threshold you cross when person can make fun of themselves. Will have conflict with clients. Separate and then discuss issue. This is a skill many home care workers have. Distinguishes those who are “good” from those who are “really good.” 00:42:34: Intimacy: if you work in medical field, you become sensitive to it. Can be complicated with male caregiver, female client. Lines you don’t cross when dressing. “Girl talk is girl talk...certain rooms we don’t go in." Client amused at my expense. Shows level of comfort. 00:44:20: Let them know what you are doing and why. Client has wounds. Paper towels...sees them as sanitation aid. Client is “old school” and prefers wash rags. Concern about transfer of germs. Bleach wipes well worth the cost. 00:47:08: Gratifying to keep client out of hospital. Teamwork has upgraded her level of health. Get her to her care. Don’t hesitate to call 911, if needed. People like little things. Catch crabs and bring some back. Bring pictures of boats for her to see. Special meals...share leftovers. 00:49:20: Flip side: days that don’t go well. Can’t bring client out of a funk. 00:51:08: Client asks to put covers back on, says her legs are cold. Jokes with her...“Why are your legs cold? You can’t walk!” Client says “I don’t know. They just get cold.” Moment we can share. Take light moments like this and make the best of them. Biggest thing is establishing trust. 00:52:50: Clients will tell you secrets. Have to keep them to yourself. 00:54:29: Psychological training comes in handy. Helps in understanding how the mind works. 00:55:48: Easy working as a couple with his wife in presenting themselves to clients. Family of one client “thought the world of them.” Went to funeral when this client died. 3  00:58:06: Active in life of client’s family. Embody trust. Current client: invite her to place where his wife’s family gathers. Client hangs out with them and has a good time. Helps with overcoming hurdles and does a world of good. 00:59:11: Union membership best thing for home care workers. Gives the occupation an identity. “In between jobs” not always recognized. Have made good strides with wages and health insurance. Ongoing effort to get legislature to enact policies that will help disabled. 01:02:37: Watches television with his client. They especially like “Bones.” Union allows caregiver to be in this type of situation...validates it. Keep ranks of home care workers strong and have a voice in Salem. 01:08:46: BEEPINTAPE. 001:10:06: Refers to story about a prosthetic device for an injured dog. Dog could run after new appendage was installed. Person who doesn’t function well will need more accommodations. People can’t imagine what it is like for a person who has a disability. 01:11:48: Client can’t walk through the mall. Can’t wear shoes and stand. Won’t be able to dance. Adjustments needed to help her adapt. Joke about it. 01:12:48: Jokes about where how he could “lay hands” on her and she walks. People don’t understand what it’s like to lose their facility. Must always put yourself in their shoes. “I am her legs, her dancing shoes, her walking through the mall.” Never tell client you know how they feel...you don’t. 01:14:56: Workaholic. Teaches basketball officials. Officiates at sports events. Loves to be in an enterprise outside of work. Would like to go back to school. 01:16:40: Anyone who goes into home care in the future will need training and development. Must design a model and be in the forefront. 01:23:17: End of interview. 4

One client is a well-known mental health activist, involved with Oregon Country Fair  knows Patch Adams and other “psychiatric clown activists.” Temporary client was a truck driver. Just starting to work with a new client who is moving to Eugene and has connections to Lane Independent Living Alliance. Likes to see agencies work together and likes to work part-time for different agencies.  00:10:13 Would have liked more specialized training with operating wheelchairs and working with immobile clients. Important to learn the right ways to twist and bend.   1    00:11:48 Works at Lane Independent Living Alliance's peer support club, “manning the desk for people who come in.” Working in groups and providing one-on-one care has “fallen together.” Client with telephone service also was member of Lane Independent Living Alliance.  00:12:39 Special skills needed? Patience. Knowing who you connect to better. Has eccentric traits and likes working with people with whom he connects.  00:13:33 Typical day? – Depends on the time of year. Part-time jobs are different pieces of a puzzle. Also, works for Harry & David (food and gift retailer) during part of the year.  00:15:34 Relationships with clients – friendly, but it is understood that he is a caregiver. Does not share details of personal life. No religion or politics unless client brings up those topics. Believes in the “consumer model” of respecting rights and boundaries of client, letting client call the shots.  00:16:47 What if a client wants to make a bad decision? Will say something if client's health is threatened.  00:17:15 Talks about forming relationships with family members of clients.  00:18:35 What do you talk about with clients?

Working for more than one agency makes is easier to steer clients toward better resources.  2    00:24:20 Is a member of SEIU [Service Employees International Union], but wants to be more involved. Understands that caregivers are not paid enough  one of the reasons why many caregivers have multiple jobs. Very supportive of SEIU.  00:25:36 Would like to get together more with other caregivers. Meets some when working in group setting. Hard to meet co-workers when doing one-on-one care.  00:26:21 Discusses experiences working at Lane Independent Living Alliance. Clients come to connect with others and participate in activities. Activities include creative writing, art, karaoke, watching games and movies together. Sometimes gets paid musical gigs through organization.  00:27:59 Performs music at assisted living facilities.  00:28:38 Most gratifying part of job: “the feeling that it seems to be working out.” No complaints from clients. Disabled people can be unhappy  likes adding humor and friendliness to their lives and empowering clients.  00:29:32 Discusses humor as a disarming mechanism. Helps alleviate depression. Tells two detailed stories about dealing with specific clients. Sometimes things get to you – tells story of having to call police on a woman. Not a painless job.  00:32:16 How do you relax? Good to have positive relationship with somebody you can talk to. Discusses the problem of self-medication  emphasizes importance of dealing with stress in other ways.  00:33:46 Still plays music for money on the “organic finger-picking circuit.” Not as many gigs as in the past. Sees performances at assisted living facilities as directly related to caregiving work  part of the whole experience. Music can be profoundly therapeutic. Old-time music—the old corny stuff—seems to work better than other songs. Very rarely plays when working in one-on-one settings. Clients have other priorities.  00:36:18 Taught music lessons at Lane Independent Living Alliance. Hoping to expand lessons for disabled people.  00:36:45 Talks about the experience of being a musician and having a day job. The day job relieves stress caused by difficulties associated with the music industry.  00:37:57 Do you define yourself as a musician first and foremost? Caregiving and music are both important. Just different parts of psyche.  3    00:38:26 Has not been involved in the union's legislative activities, but wants to participate more with SEIU.  00:38:48 Discusses union songs and mentions musicians Woody Guthrie and Harry Stamper.  00:39:18 Has written songs influenced by previous day jobs.

Was severely injured working as a forest fire fighter  experienced being temporarily disabled.  00:45:18 Has worked mostly with men, but is willing to work with women. Depends on what the client wants. Has worked with women in group settings.  00:46:06 Wants clients to feel that they have power. Without that, you are going back to the “old medical model” where doctor gives orders and patients follow. Learned a lot about client empowerment from client who has been an activist for a long time. Mentions the influence of Ken Kesey's “One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest” and the “hippie radical movement.”  00:48:16 What are some things that people in the community might not know about your job? Technical stuff like handling wheelchairs and other technology. Many people cannot imagine themselves working with people with disabilities.  00:50:08 Discusses occupational culture of working at Harry & David. Refers to job taking orders over the phone as being a “pear jockey” and tells humorous work-related story.  00:51:30 How do you balance multiple jobs and hobbies?

TakingCare; Carol Tyndall Conlon;xxxx;2014;Taking Care--Documenting the Occupational Culture of Home Care Workers  Archie Green Fellows Project, 2014-2015  (AFC 2014/021: 01420)  Archive of Folk Culture, American Folklife Center, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.  Carol Tyndall Conlon interview, 2014-12-16 : interview conducted by Michael  Robert Bussel  INTERVIEW LOG 00:00:22: Other jobs before becoming caregiver for her son: medical transcriptionist, worked for lawyers, Oregon Health Plan, managed office for Habitats for Humanity. Moved to Oregon in 1981. 00:02:21: Formal care for her son when he “aged out” of high school. Has been his caregiver since 2001. Long waiting list for group homes. Son needed more emotional support and nurturing. Has autism, “child in adult’s body.” 00:04:57: More one-one-one time with her son and greater bond developed. Increase in his confidence and abilities. Outcome of his growing independence will determine what type of care is subsequently needed. 00:07:48: Left private sector employment to focus on her son. Learned more about him by having time to observe. Example: son disturbed while she was driving. Expressed empathy. Son is now more expressive. Signals that he wants to be touched, looks her in the eye more often. “Accidental breakthrough,” unexpected benefit. 00:11:24: Patience key in working with people with disabilities, especially those with cognitive disabilities. Lots of frustration when you can’t do things. Must not show frustration as a caregiver. Do job to best of your ability. Employment is a journey. 00:14:51: Finding other caregivers important in dealing with autism. Autism support group, people share tips on what works—immensely helpful. Sense of camaraderie and not being alone. Immediate bond. 00:17:45: Receives calls from families around the state. People say “you understand me.” In previous job, asked to speak with parents of children with developmental disabilities. They say, “Now I trust you” once they learned she had child with autism. 1  00:21:17: Common denominator: finding someone who understands, who will believe you and trust you. 00:22:39: Families of children with disabilities experience discrimination. Insensitive comments from others. Discrimination against her son because of his lack of cognition. Unique experience of being family caregiver does not go away once children become adults. Sense of protectiveness and desire that children have opportunities to access needed services. 00:24:15: Caregivers as parent. Have to advocate for their children, be their voice. Protect their health, safety, welfare, rights. 00:26:28: Typical day. Cues her son the night before to get ready for work the next day. Quiets house, lowers lights. In morning, opens door, turns on light, announces time they will leave. Prepares breakfast, lunch, snack he will like. Talks about appropriate clothing. Sets the mood. Relationship building. 00:30:14: Brings her son home from work. Asks about his work day. Cues with specific times for things to get done. Will be important when he begins to live more independently. 00:31:42: Electronic devices help her son. Check in verbally, visually by text. At fast food restaurant when son is ordering, only steps in as needed. Has seen positive effects on people who interact with her son. 00:34:02: In coffee shop, people love her son. Know his idiosyncrasies. He has developed friendships. Quality of life better for her son. Now laughs, has sense of humor. Pulled him out of his shell. Different person emerging. 00:37:13: Humor is part of bringing her son into experience of human relationships. Son has learned to laugh at himself. Importance of inclusion in schools for disabled kids. 00:39:20: Empowering for those with disabilities to have experiences similar to those who are non-disabled. Build self-confidence and independence. Define success on basis of overcoming challenges. Son got a standing ovation from audience when he graduated from high school. Profound moment. Fellow students changed by contact with her son. 00:45:03: Approached SEIU seeking help on policy advocacy. Labor issues and advocacy intertwine, overlap. Union actually listened. Felt validated. Union has helped on political side. 00:47:46: Called to testify before legislative committee. Noted deficiencies in policies and their effects on people with disabilities. Able to get significant legislation passed. Changes mean “my son is going to have a life.” 2  00:51:20: Job is ongoing. Has safety net in place when she is not around. Need complete break at times. Wants others involved as part of her son’s transitioning. 00:53:51: At a crossroads. Didn’t want to place her son in setting with people who might not understand his needs. Had to make a choice. Sacrifice so her son could be the best and most independent person he could be. Who best to help him transition but someone who is most familiar with him and could be his advocate. Family caregivers will not outlive their children. Need to make a gradual transition. 00:55:52: Digital scrapbooking as a leisure time activity. 00:57:35: Early years, only knew one other mother who had child with disabilities. Felt like two lone people. Got to be more of us. Learned if something is not right, don’t dismiss it. Never dreamed we would have another group in union to add to home care. Blind faith, had no navigational tools. Now get training, paid health care, camaraderie, community. What if people had given up? 01:00:27: New policies. My child will have a life. Things we do in life that don’t have a title or earn economic compensation. Gratifying. Pushed against fears. No road map. Inner satisfaction. Improve workers’ lives and quality of life for clients. 01:02:19: End of interview. 3    
TakingCare; Bobbie Sotin;1963;2015;Taking Care--Documenting the Occupational Culture of Home Care Workers   Archie Green Fellows Project, 2014-2015   (AFC 2014/021: 01580)   Archive of Folk Culture, American Folklife Center, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.   Bobbie Sotin interview, 2015-01-21 : interview conducted by Nathan J. Moore   and Donald Eugene Stacy   INTERVIEW LOG  Additional Notes: Bobbie refers to the people for whom she cares as both consumers and clients. Time coded logs for audio file afc2014021_01580_sr01  00:00:00 Introductions, audio and video set-up, signing of release forms.  00:02:49 Name is Bobbie Sotin. Born December 12, 1963, in Crescent City, California. 00:04:43 Been a home care worker since 2001.  00:04:52 Previous jobs – stay-at-home mother for 17 years. Went back to college and earned GED (General Educational Development) certificate. Worked at 7-11, which was awful. Also worked retail in a myrtle wood shop, then started another job at a call center with medical benefits. Wanted to choose her own hours. Put in application at senior services and became a home care worker.  00:06:07 Works with clients with disabilities.  00:06:30 How is caregiving different from previous work? Hard but rewarding. Has been a caregiver her whole life. Cared for grandparents and mother. “It was just a natural thing for me.” Was stressed at the call center job, but there was no reward for the work. Likes working with people who appreciate her. Also likes knowing that clients' lives are better because she is there.  00:07:21 Currently has three clients. Two seniors and one middle-aged client. Works 24 per month with each client. Doesn't work for the money because husband has a good job. Does a lot of union work so that other home care providers can get raises and pay their bills.  00:08:37 Can anyone do this job? No. You have to be able to cope with stress and different types of personalities. Has quit a few jobs due to the situation, but that has been rare. Has  1    worked with over 30 clients. Worked for one client for three and a half years. Sometimes you just don't mesh with a person. You can't make someone else change. If you can't deal with a client's personality, then you shouldn't be in that job. Decided to quit a job because the client was racist. It's not easy to quit a job. Had to quit another job when one client was diagnosed with cancer and needed more care.  00:11:50 Has worked with several clients who passed away. It can be very hard, but it's part of the job when you take care of people who are elderly and sick.  00:13:03 Mother and father were caregivers, but both had to retire. Two of her nieces were also home care workers. One is now training to become a nurse and the other is going to be a pharmacist. Daughter and sister are both foster parents. Caregiving comes natural to her family. Parents were union members too.  00:14:32 There are over 20 trainings provided by the Home Care Commission. Has taken all the trainings many times. Every time you're in a room with another person, you can learn something new. Some trainings should be paid for before workers even start, especially “Preventing Disease Transmission.” She is working to get home care workers paid for certain trainings before they start working with clients.  00:17:30 Is there a typical day in your field? Yes. Cleans, makes food, and manages meds for one client. The shift passes quickly. Has one client who is doing more for herself now. Acknowledging clients' improvements can be tricky  they might think they will lose their home care worker. Usually tries to be upfront and encourage them. The state will sometimes reduce the hours of care a client needs when they still need them. Home care workers can talk to case managers about this, but change often comes from family members.  00:22:16 Relationships with clients – you can't help but get close to them. Has become so comfortable with clients that she had to quit. When you start saying things that you would say to a family member instead of a boss, it's time to move on. She usually recognizes this and explain it to clients.  00:24:20 She got one of her jobs because she was filling in for another caregiver. The client liked her better. Doesn't like it when that happens. When she fills in for others, she tries to make sure that clients understand that she is just a substitute.  00:25:16 Impossible not to have clients become like family. The longer you're with them, the more it happens.  00:25:44 How do you deal with getting too close to clients? Sometimes have to back peddle. Has talked to clients about the situation. Usually clients are happy as long as needs are filled.  2    00:27:03 Decided not to work with a couple  her parents took the job instead. Bobbie's father got them to take their meds and stop calling 9-1-1 every day. Sometimes it just takes guidance and somebody who cares. Previous caregiver had told them that they didn't have to take their medication. Not the right thing to do. Home care workers should encourage clients to follow the doctor's instructions.  00:29:13 Did you ever “talk shop” with your parents? Yes. Shared helpful advice. The same thing happens at union meetings.  00:29:41 The registry helps a lot with finding the right caregiver for a client. Clients answer questions and the registry matches them up with an appropriate caregiver. There's different work associated with each client. You don't have to know how to do everything. Some clients have more difficult situations (feeding tubes, wheelchairs, etc.).  00:30:56 Specific stories that illustrate the work? Yes. Worked for a gentleman who had 88 hours of care per month. His case was re-evaluated and he was knocked down to 20 hours per month. He had to go through an appeal and was worried. Request for more hours denied. He had a stroke and became paralyzed on one side. He had to get a ramp put in his house, but the state chose lowest bidder. Ramp wasn't put in properly. Sees this as neglect on the part of the state. Home care workers notice these situations.  00:35:05 Current clients all receive twenty hours of care. One of them should have “mileage” in her plan due to physical disabilities. Expected to get on bus and haul groceries home by herself. State should help her with this. Transportation is an issue—clients have to walk in rain from doctors' offices to the bus stop. Clients should be let off at the office and helped into the office. Bobbie's goal is to get extra help for people who need some variation in their care plans.  00:38:18 Home care workers and clients cannot exchange money. If they need to pay for transportation, clients have to go through complicated systems involving prepaid cards.  00:40:02 Comment by Don Stacy: money can't be exchanged between clients and home care workers due to incidents of financial abuse. Some consumers also felt the need to buy gifts for staff. Bobbie agrees with the law. Notes that home care workers previously received checks for situations that now involve transferring money to prepaid cards. Not easy for people who already lack transportation. Bobbie often ends up providing transportation for free. “A home care worker's gonna do what needs to be done whether they're getting paid for it or not. It comes with the territory because the plans that the state has don't always fit the person.”  00:42:33 Has lobbied at the State Capitol many times. Wears purple union colors. Government takes a long time to change. Current clients might be interested in participating in lobby days,  3    but previous clients have not been able to go due to physical disabilities. Has taken a consumer from town who is not her client.  Time coded logs for audio file afc2014021_01580_sr02  00:00:06: Chants are part of union activities on lobby days. Doesn't remember specific chants, but there are a lot. Union members sing as well. Mentions Paul McKenna (Research Director, SEIU 503) who writes chants and songs.  00:00:40 How has the union affected your job? It has given home care workers a route to improving consumers' lives. Home care workers lobby for more money in the state budget for services. They have also given money from their contracts to pay for senior services.  00:02:49 Thinks that many community members don't know that home care workers exist. They don't have a clue until something happens to them or a family member. Once in awhile, people hear about home care workers who steal from clients, but they don't hear the good stories. Example of a good story: the Home Care Commission recently recognized a worker who recovered a client's stolen purse.  00:03:58 Doesn't know what to call clients anymore. They've been consumers, clients, customers. Tries to call them “client-employers.”  00:04:30 Union helps home care workers to network with each other. This makes it better for everyone, including case managers. Case managers learn a lot now from home care workers. In the past, they've only heard from clients. Discusses importance of home care workers attending doctor's visits. Consumers forget to tell doctors important information.  00:07:33 Tremendously important to have a sense of humor on the job. If you don't laugh at life, you're not going to make it. Clients joke with home care workers too. People who have dementia are hard to care for, though, because hey forget who you are. Home care workers need to have very thick skins.  00:10:00 Clients know when something is going on in your personal life. They want to help. You have to be careful about what you say. Gives example of breaking cake pan  client wanted to buy one for her.  00:12:14 Hobbies? Enjoying new grandchildren. Likes to ride Harley with husband and play Bingo. Also likes her “alone time,” which can be hard to find.  00:15:28 Works with both men and women. Prefers not to work with smokers, but isn't always possible. Discusses the problems of “third hand smoke.”  4    00:17:41 Talks about the occupational hazards of handling pills. Home care workers have to wear gloves to touch certain medications.  00:18:20 Discussion between Don Stacy and Bobbie Sotin about wearing gloves on the job. Bobbie: “It took us forever to get the State to provide us gloves.”  00:19:49 “Preventing Disease Transmission” class provides home care workers with trainings on universal precautions. Wants home care workers to have to attend class before starting the job.  00:21:08 Discussion between Don Stacy and Bobbie Sotin about OSHA rules.  00:23:30 Hopes for the profession: sufficient funds that provide for the consumers. Baby Boomers are retiring and some will need care providers. Doesn't think we have enough home care workers right now to supply the demand.  00:24:31 Thinks trainings and union meetings should be required. Home care workers need to be educated about the union.  00:24:54 Has been on the last four bargaining committees during contract negotiations. It is a lot of work. “It doesn't seem like the State gets their cookies, or ducks, in a row until the last five minutes of the race.” Very frustrating. Thinks the other side should be happy that home care workers are saving the state of Oregon a lot of money. Home care will be around for as long the state provides funding.  00:28:11 A lot of home care workers are older  thinks the average age is fifty-five. Her mother was on the job when she had a stroke.  00:29:47 How to recruit new home care workers? “Having a wage you can live off.” Home care workers are now making $13.75 per hour. It took six years to get beyond $10.20 per hour, which didn't encourage people to go into home care. Home care workers now only have to work 40 hours per month to be eligible for the union health insurance. Bobbie usually works fifty to 55 hours per month. Doesn't always use up the allotted hours for each client.  00:32:35 You can't work over the allotted hours for each client and get paid. If consumers need more help, they have to contact case managers. Hard for clients to call case managers because they don't always receive a call back. Case managers are overloaded.  00:35:16 End of interview  5    6       
TakingCare;April Shattuck;xxxx;2014;Taking Care--Documenting the Occupational Culture of Home Care Workers   Archie Green Fellows Project, 2014-2015   (AFC 2014/021: 01121)   Archive of Folk Culture, American Folklife Center, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.   April Shattuck interview, 2014-10-20 : interview conducted by Sonia De La   Cruz and Nathan J. Moore   INTERVIEW LOG  Time coded logs for audio file afc2014021_01121_sr01:  00:00:01 April Shattuck lives in Northeast Portland, has lived there all her life.  00:01:07 Has degrees in Psychology and Early Childhood Education, but trained mostly on the job.  00:01:24 Works mostly with adults with developmental disabilities.  00:01:53 Other jobs–office work, representative for a produce company, stay-at-home mom, house cleaner, nanny, jobs in the “care centered arena.”  00:02:23 How is care-giving different from other jobs? Much more “person-centered.” Would not want to sit in an office all day. Job is always changing, full of problem-solving opportunities, never a dull moment.  00:03:54 Began care-giving at the age of nine for quadriplegic neighbor. Neighbor easier to care for than clients with mental disabilities. Home care workers must develop a personal sense of wanting to help others.  00:05:32 Typical duties depend on customer’s goals. Important to make sure clients are physically active. Other duties: nutritional education, helping customer volunteer in community. Customers like to go to stores, walk around neighborhood, and connect with others with disabilities.  00:07:26 Typical routine? Depends on the customer. Some live on their own and interact less with caregivers than others. One client receives one hundred hours of care per month, which is a lot, but needs help with getting dressed, preparing meals, other daily tasks.  1    00:09:34 Schedule mostly nine-to-five by choice. Likes to have afternoons and evenings free. Some customers do not like to go out at night.  00:10:32 Relationships with customers-–you are their family. Customers sometimes get to know April’s family as well. Families with developmentally disabled members become overwhelmed, and some customers have little contact with parents.  00:12:04 Important to get information from customers about how they were raised, ways in which they did not receive support.  00:13:18 Maintaining boundaries with customers is a fine line. You have to be clear with customers. Many would call every day if they could. Does become personally involved, though  includes customers in family activities.  00:14:28 Does not take job stress home. Works through scenarios with customers about how to get their needs met when they are on their own.  00:15:23 Many home care workers bring the stress home with them and that leads to burnout.  00:15:45 It has taken awhile to learn how to leave work stress at work.  00:16:52 Discusses language used when talking about customers to others (with customers present). Ways to “talk around” certain issues without making clients feel bad. Example of Portland bus company denying customer personal lift service.  00:18:35 Importance of being delicate and respectful with customers.  00:19:00 How to develop trust with customers–making clients feel valuable, encouraging independence, understanding customers’ backgrounds.  00:20:55 Interacts often with other home care providers. Encouraged three close friends to become certified care providers.  00:23:21 Important to have sense of humor  you have to laugh at yourself.  00:24:22 Has kept all of the same clients since the beginning, but was fired from first job. In Oregon, customers choose care providers and type of care, which is good, but can be problematic if the right person is not helping them make decisions.  00:25:11 Being fired was devastating for a short time, but relationship was not meant to be.  2    00:25:22 The most challenging parts – the medical system, doctors putting customers on various pills. Customers do not always understand medical questions.  00:27:31 Important to accompany customers to medical appointments, any place where they are asked questions that affect care.  00:28:56 Talks about joining the union – made a difference in personal life. No legal representation in the past. The state government created home care position in response to a lawsuit, and Oregon is only state with a brokerage system. Before, home care workers had no legal recourse if clients complained or accused them of mistreatment.  TIME CODED LOGS FOR AUDIO FILE afc2014021_01121_sr02:  00:00:07 The union has given a voice to workers without workers having to hire lawyers. There is also healthcare through a state-run trust system. Was paying $115.00 a month for catastrophic care before the joining the union.  00:01:17 Has taken customers to political events about home health care issues. One customer enjoys going to union rallies and wearing SEIU [Service Employees International Union] t-shirts and hats to the events.  00:02:05 Does the customer who likes to go to rallies understand the union issues? Yes, briefly. Also likes to go get out and go to Salem, thinks it’s cool to talk to politicians. It’s important for politicians to see people who need home care workers because the government controls their lives, money, social security benefits. If they work, the government will cut social security benefits.  00:03:16 A lot of home care workers attend political rallies and events. Many are care providers for family members, called personal support workers. Independent contractors like April have to fill out more paperwork, deal with more red tape.  00:04:13 Lots of songs and chants at political events. Several people are very enthusiastic about the songs. Bus trips to the state capitol (Salem) that include lots of chants.  00:04:48 Rallies occur when there is legislation being passed that affects home care workers. When other groups of workers in SEIU are threatened by legislation, home care workers support them too.  00:05:22 Was a delegate at the SEIU 503 General Council Meeting. Meetings happen every two years. Lots of organizational work involved. So many things to vote on. Was able to meet the  3    different factions in the union. Was not previously aware of the vast differences between various union factions.  00:07:15 Something surprising about the job? I get to go grocery shopping at Fred Meyer’s every week (laughing). I get to go to the river on a sunny day. Many fun activities that people sitting in cubicles do not get to do.  00:08:07 Seeing people’s reactions to what customers do and say is funny. You have to educate people on what it’s like to have disabilities.  00:09:25 Hobbies? Hiking and gardening. Going to places where there’s no water, no electricity. Getting out in the wilderness is grounding. Likes to be active.  00:10:07 Can avoid thinking about work when away, traveling. Customers will get help from family members and others in their vicinities.  00:10:35 Plan on doing this job in the future? I plan on doing this as long as I’m needed to do this. Other plans – more extensive things with the world. Involved in projects to make the world better, more sustainable. Want to help people obtain really basic necessities-water, housing, schools.  00:11:24 The need to help dates back to childhood. A personal thing. You either want to help make our world better or you’re not concerned about it.  00:12:01 Hopes that people with disabilities get to lead the life that they want to live. Wants them to contribute to the world and not just be put aside. Just because you have a disability does not mean that you’re not as smart as the average person. Society could really utilize disabled people.  00:13:52 An experience that floored you completely or made you want to cry? Yes, self-injurious customer has made April cry on numerous occasions. She has been on drugs that have influenced behavior. Almost like caring for daughter, definitely a parent-child relationship. Customer is on a special diet that affects behavior as well. “I don’t know what I’m going to walk into every time I work into her house.”  00:17:06 Has nicknames for her self-injurious customer.  00:17:17 Self-injurious customer has a supportive family. Family has had to deal with daughter being put on various diets and psychotropic drugs. Customer’s brother is a personal support worker for her.  00:18:28 Used to be against drugs given to customers, but has seen helpful side of drugs too.  4    00:19:55 You basically are a parent to them, even though you’re a support worker. They might be fully grown and bigger than you. Motivating them can be difficult.  00:21:03 Are there people who could not do this job? Yes – people who like their “ducks in a row.” Most customers are easy to work with, but it is similar to teaching preschool. Has a customer who has to be reminded to go to the bathroom every fifteen minutes.  00:22:05 Takes customers weekly to play bingo at a day center for Alzheimer’s patients. Also takes one customer to volunteer with cats.  00:24:03 Very matter-of-fact with customers. Some home care workers are quiet. There many great males who work in the industry. There are customers who need a male connection. Hates going to the mall, but many customers like going there.  5       
TakingCare; Annie Smith;1945;2014;Taking Care--Documenting the Occupational Culture of Home Care Workers   Archie Green Fellows Project, 2014-2015   (AFC 2014/021: 01342)   Archive of Folk Culture, American Folklife Center, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.   Annie Smith interview, 2014-11-21 : interview conducted by Helen Marie   Moss   INTERVIEW LOG  00:00:00 Housekeeping, signing forms. Born in Arcola, Mississippi in 1945. 00:01:00 Live in Southeast Portland.  00:01:18 Home care worker since 1983 - Became a home care worker when husband had an accident and went into a nursing home, had a stroke, was in a coma after surgery. Was there 1.5 years, and then when woke up was paralyzed from knees down. I took training orientation from the state and I took care of him until he passed in 1997.  00:02:25 In 1998, a friend of mine asked if I would take care of his mother. Got a provider number from the state, and started getting paid. They would not pay me to take care of husband, but other people were paid!  00:02:45 Pay $3.37 in 1993 - when I started getting paid, it increased to $5.75.  00:03:00 Story about union organizer Jean Yamamoto. She was coming to her door in Cedar Hills. Never been active in unions, was active in civil rights movement in Mississippi, and in Oregon, knocking on doors for voter registration. Jean was very persistent, convinced her to come to a rally in Salem. When she didn't have a ride, she picked her up and took her - so she couldn't get out of it. Started from there in 1999, when we got first contract.  00:05:30 Other jobs - first job when teenager, had her first son so they kicked her out of school. Got a job at a restaurant - Old Southern Tearoom - had to dress up like Aunt Jemima! Darker you were, the more they liked you. Met a lot of people - all white. Catered parties, too, on steamboat.  00:07:34 Left Mississippi in 1977, came to Oregon, went to PCC (Portland Community College) started first African-American Cultural Club at PCC. Took accounting, and graduated in 1983.  1    00:08:23 Got a job as a receptionist, through college program. Then shipping and receiving at a sheet metal shop  the shop is still there.  00:09:28 Worked until 1985, then got married, stopped working until became a home care worker.  00:09:40 Two clients: one downtown and one at an assisted living.  00:10:02 Difference between home care jobs and other jobs? The caring. See that the other person can be able to live in their own home. Story about 93-year-old "feisty" client who only wants one caregiver, but has multiple caregivers. No supervisor but her, so have to work it out between them.  00:12:00 Skills, abilities needed? Patience, have to care about people. Clients are old and have medical problems, may not have family. You are like family because you are in their personal space, have to be honest, not pilfer.  00:12:51 How learn? When you have a family, you learn it. Have to care about people but not take it to heart. Be patient, loving.  00:13:33 No formal training.  00:14:00 Typical day - description of day with her client, starting from ringing the bell downstairs. Need to let them take the lead in their house. Come in and do job from "task list" that State gives them both.  00:15:36 "Our job is to make your house look like it did when you were up on your feet."  00:16:15 Do you become close? Of course. It is hard when they have to go into a nursing home or pass away. Story about a client, who passed away while she was there, grateful children.  00:17:48 Set boundaries - story about client buying a shampooer for carpet - had to tell him, not on task list, can't do that. They do get upset, but some things we are not supposed to do.  00:18:57 Get together with others? Union meetings, it is hard because we don't work together or see each other. That is hard, no camaraderie, can't talk about client, against rules.  00:20:00 Homecare workers do have terms they use, they understand each other.  00:20:50 Story about blind client whose hours were cut back, and started trying to do things herself, and could not do it. We home care workers could not be there enough. She would fall.  2    Had to involve the neighbors. Finally she had to be put in a nursing home, even though it was more expensive than increasing hours.  00:24:09 Compassion and sense of humor are most important.  00:25:12 Gratifying - being able to be there for the client, on time! Story about client who she jokes with about his cooking skills, and what a mess he makes. But he loves to cook, my job is to keep him happy, and fuss a little bit.  00:27:05 Most challenging - when client is sick and nothing you can do but make them comfortable.  00:27:28 Clients call them housekeepers to friends, not caregivers.  00:28:00 Difference being in a union? It is a big deal. At the bargaining table 2 times: last time long bargaining, there until late at night. Not leaving the table until we get a raise and health care.  00:29:26 She told organizer to have them "show you the money."  00:29:46 Without the union, we'd have less people doing home care work. Just indentured servants, housekeepers. State not your boss, but they really are. Client is the boss.  00:30:50 Got a decent raise.  00:31:13 Spoke at a downtown rally marching across the bridge. Been up to Sea-Tac to help with getting the $15 minimum wage.  00:32:04 What is it that people don't know about your job? Compassion, treat them with respect.  00:32:33 Hobbies? Loves to dance, listen to music, talk to kids in neighborhood, bring them candy.  00:33:50 How do you think the community, at large, perceives you, values you? They do, all my neighbors see me when I come home. I know other home care workers who live nearby, Ukrainian woman she knows, who takes care of Russian clients, we talk.  00:36:39 End of interview.  3

Anna Young interview, 2015-03-04 : interview conducted by Helen Marie  Moss and Donald Eugene Stacy  INTERVIEW LOG 00:00:00 Housekeeping items, forms. 00:01:26 I live in Columbia County, 35 miles from Astoria, Oregon. 00:02:06 Other jobs - part-time high school internship at the Lane County Dog Control, Forest Service as secretarial, medical insurance data entry for 11 years. Moved to Hillsboro for husband's job, then Columbia County. 00:04:19 I have been a homecare worker since 2004. Worked in various programs, but right now Medicaid clients. Has one client, who had a stroke, sharing hours with another home care worker. Discusses progress of this client now that he has home care workers helping. She also gives care as a volunteer to her mother. 00:06:32 I became a home care worker because friend of family, who is a case manager, asked me to try it. My friend thought I would be good and that I would love it. I was not so sure. First client was age 92 and I was the "respite" caregiver so his daughter could get out once in awhile. 00:08:16 It is fascinating to get into other people's world. You get attached even though you are not supposed to. I don't mind taking care of them. Relates some of her skills and accomplishments with clients, to help keep them in homes. 00:10:01 Talks about the Oregon Home Care Commission classes and how good they are, what other classes are needed. 00:11:30 Typical day - goes through her duties and tasks with stroke client. He is a jokester, but a gentleman. Personal care kept on a professional level. I encourage him to do things himself. Watch TV or play cards or do exercises for hands. 00:16:58 Get close to clients? I do become close. I know there is a "shut down" process, but happy they were able to stay in homes. 1  00:18:06 Hard to "turn it off?" Yes, had to learn to have "my time" as well. I walk with dogs to the creek to regroup. 00:19:30 Important to regroup because stressful situations outside of the actual care situation. Client budget is tight, wants to help them but can't or if they want to give you things and can't, accept it. 00:20:00 Stories? Past client, before classes had been established. Client was stubborn, hard to get someone to assist her. No family, one person supposed to be helping her, but wasn't. Home was a small trailer, horrifying place. No dementia, so refused to move, and nothing could be done. Had to gain confidence before washing sheets, took a long time. These programs that help people like her are awesome. 00:24:16 Sense of humor important? Depends on consumer. Helps with redirecting for dementia. Tells story about client concerned about a tree leaning too much and using humor instead of arguing. 00:26:30 It is the most gratifying to help someone, turn around a bad day with a funny story. Keep them in their home rather than a facility. 00:27:55 Many things are challenging. If clients are confused or mad, bad news from family members that upsets client, putting client in a confused state. 00:29:10 Union? Helped tremendously, support us, recognize us. I have gone to rallies, blitzes, union has trained us how to do these things. Example of union organizer helping her with a client situation. Has done lobby days with legislators, enjoys them. Worked in politics in 2012, canvassing for a local politician. 00:32:00 One thing would tell someone who has never done caregiving job? Very rewarding and a challenge. 00:32:17 Hobbies? Travel, horseback riding, looking up political stuff. Never political before, but now write letters to politicians because they have helped us tremendously. 00:33:08 Anything else? Thanks for doing this, show people not just a job. There are volunteer opportunities. She takes people out on off time, with permission. Her client used to fish, likes to watch the boats go by on the river. 35:14 Do you feel valued by community? Sometimes family members have no clue what we do. Others think they know but don't. In town, issue of neighbors talking to her, but she can't 2  discuss client with them due to confidentiality. My own family doesn't always understand what I do, I want them to understand so I won't be put in a facility against my will. 38:03 End of interview. 3    
TakingCare; Alice Redding;xxxx;2014;Taking Care--Documenting the Occupational Culture of Home Care Workers  Archie Green Fellows Project, 2014-2015  (AFC 2014/021: 01660)  Archive of Folk Culture, American Folklife Center, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.  Alice Redding interviews, 2014-11-21 and 2015-03-04: interviews conducted  by Helen Marie Moss and Donald Eugene Stacy  INTERVIEW LOG 11/21/14 Portland, Oregon Pre-interview: chatting, housekeeping and forms. From East Coast, lived in lots of places. Now Lives in Rainier, Oregon. 00:04:40 00:05:15 PART1: 00:00:00 00:02:44 Been a home care worker 14 years, works with clients who are physically unable and 00:03:32 seniors, some with mental, 2 -3 clients. Fell into it - word of mouth, ended up working with State. Have to be patient, caring, understanding. Let them do what they want to do. I learned being around other people, cared for father and mother, a natural gift I was 00:06:12 blessed with, but did home care commission classes, gives examples of the classes. Wonderful classes. 00:07:45 Typical workday - you have a routine, look around at what needs to be done, any special requests. Just being there for them, helping them out making sure the place looks nice. 00:09:15 You get close, how could you not? (Cause you stress?) Not really, they have to know that after hours I have a life. They get lonesome and they need us, but we have to set boundaries. 00:11:11 Story about falling asleep driving home after helping someone at night. Glad I was there for her, but pushed myself too far. Did what I had to do. Other clients have called late in the evening. So rewarding when they say "so glad you are here." 00:13:12 Other jobs: McDonald's, Target, pre-school teacher, gas attendant, cleaning houses before senior services. Volunteer for special reading, loved working with kids, with other people  at McDonald's did birthday parties - it was so much fun. 1  00:14:00 Caregiving is different because focus is on one person, more personal. The others are just jobs. More rewarding, feel more needed. 00:15:00 Regional meetings, trainings, we have a way of connecting. (Special things you talk about?) Talk about issues we have, and help each other. What is going on, I am union rep so look up to me. Chit chat about everything, but mostly issues  we are going to bargaining soon. Encourage them to participate, phone banks, rallies. 00:17:00 Very important to have a sense of humor, cause it is stressful sometimes. It makes the client's feel better. Breaks their mood from negative to positive. 00:17:49 Most gratifying - being there, helping, keeping them in their homes, giving them independence, they love it. I say "Do you what you can do and I'll fill in the gaps". 00:18:45 Most challenging? - when you are in a bad mood or you say something and they take it the wrong way, just don't take it personal. It's hard sometimes. 00:19:46 How has the union made a difference? Given me a structure, a reason  encouraged me to be a leader. I am a voice for my clients, my home care workers, helped me grow. Some challenges - talking to senators, organized rallies, orientations, regional meetings. I am getting so that I am not afraid. They see the good in people and bring it out. 00:22:11 One thing public should know: my job is helping stay in their homes, keeping them out of nursing homes. 00:23:30 Community perceives you? I have a small community - when they find out what I do they say, "that's great". 00:24:00 (Anything else?) Important to make sure you are compatible with the client during the interview. Ask each other questions. Know where each other are coming from, feel comfortable. I have had situations. Set boundaries. 00:25:30 Got involved in the union in 2006, started by going to meetings, then canvassed for the elections in 2010, each time you learn and grow. Hard to knock on doors at first, and talking to people, now easy. Learned from union and clients. A year or so left and I am going to make the most of it. 00:27:17 Ways benefit? Learning to not take things personally, clients teaching me their ways, two-way street. It is wonderful - I help them, they help me. 2  00:28:33 Chatting about the video. 00:29:58 End of PART 1 PART 2: 3/4/15 Rainier, Oregon 00:00:23 We talked about church where we are doing the second interview, been going to church for 30 years, lived in Rainier for 46 years, was in the Marines, talks about her husband and family, living in a small town. 00:02:05 Honored to be a leader in the union, union is a good share of her life, without them would not have benefits. 00:02:45 Clients in Rainier, excited for her to do interview. 00:03:51 (dealing with heater noise) 00:04:41 (homecare workers everywhere in state - peer group?) Yes, regional meetings. All connect, do "door knocks" get to know each other. Did not know the other people before the union, did not know about home care. Just had a meeting in Astoria. Also phone calls and internet. 00:06:55 Talks about husband being a marine and going to Vietnam. Proud of him. Talks about church, loves to sing. 00:07:45 Hobbies and things she likes to do. Loves the outdoor activities of the area. 00:09:10 End of interview. 3

Adelina Martinez interview, 2015-06-14 : interview conducted by Michael  Robert Bussel and Sonia De La Cruz  INTERVIEW LOG 00:00:40: Name is Adelina Martinez. Lives in Hillsboro, Oregon. Born in 1969 in Cuernavaca, Mexico in the State of Morelos. 00:01:40: Other jobs have been teacher’s assistant, work at a pre-school, instruction for children at home, jobs in the fields, hotels, restaurants. 00:02:57: Has a child who is twenty years old. Started as home provider for him ten months ago but has cared for him since 1994. 00:04:01: Other person helps care for her son. Has two children with disabilities. What’s important is that as a mother I understand needs of my child: appointments, therapy, meetings. Involved in everything and always with him. 00:05:40: Has to act as “translator” for child because of way he speaks: others cannot always understand him. 00:06:25: Home care in contrast to other jobs: more personal, requires lots of patience. Son gives me that patience. Son is easy going and always has a smile. He is a “happy boy.” 00:08:00: Need to be understanding, available, responsible. 00:09:06: Learned on her own about caregiving. Not only by being a mother. Therapist shows her things. Form of learning for her. 00:10:30: Typical day: bathing, teach child to be independent, help him get dressed, put shoes on proper foot, read books, give foot massages when needed. 00:12:15: Sometimes when meeting with other caregivers: talk about schedules, proper lifting, how to handle difficult situations. 1  00:15:42: Humor necessary with children. Children feel it when someone is happy or sad. 00:16:30: Helping a child be independent is gratifying. When parents are not around, hopes her child will be self-sufficient, be able to prepare a meal. 00:18:27: Frustrating not to know about resources such as things that can help with getting into a tub or onto a toilet. Resources not fully explained. Hears about resources by word of mouth from other parents. Good to know about other parents who have children with disabilities. 00:23:25: Is member of the union but doesn’t know who to connect with. Had a bad situation with another provider who was speaking to union organizer and she had to take care of her child. Was not a union member at that point. 00:27:30: Realized that she could be a provider herself. Joined union recently. 00:30:29: As mother, takes care of children and their specific needs. Has time to do that. Her work but also that of her family. Support to give children what they need. 00:32:12: Before: had to rely on other people. Others tried to take care of her child. Some afraid to do so. Others would charge a lot more and not do everything that a child needs. 00:33:41: To relax: takes walks with her husband, has coffee with friends. 00:34:55: Children have same feelings as everybody else. They have a sincere love for others. No bad or malicious thoughts. 00:36:28: Difficult for a mother to separate emotions that she might have. Friday “escapades” with friends are important given how hard her work week has been. Helps her unwind. 00:37:29: End of interview. 2   
TakingCare;Adam Christopher Riggs;xxxx;2014;Taking Care--Documenting the Occupational Culture of Home Care Workers  Archie Green Fellows Project, 2014-2015  (AFC 2014/021: 01220)  Archive of Folk Culture, American Folklife Center, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.  Adam Christopher Riggs interview, 2014-10-29 : interview conducted by  Michael Robert Bussel  INTERVIEW LOG 00:00:28: Name is Adam Riggs. 14 years as home care worker. Has worked with clients who are disabled and elderly. 00:01:02: Recruited into industry by a disabled person. Previously worked in food service. Found home care more engaging. 00:01:35: Likes one-on-one relationship of home care. More autonomy. More emotional labor. Must give slack to people. Allow them to be themselves. Be upbeat. 00:02:34: Need patience, good sense of humor. Pay attention to all aspects of a person’s needs. 00:03:16: Learn from person you take care of. Each person has different set of objectives. Attended classes put on by Oregon Home Care Commission. Most training has been on the job. 00:04:11: Typical day: traveling by car or auto. Personal care help. Housekeeping, pharmacy visits, trips to doctor. Lots of coming and going. Not on call, but must be available based on client’s needs. 00:06:26: Develop close working relationship with client. Modify your behavior to accommodate client. Can’t seek too intimate a relationship. Absurd to think we are automatons who can turn our emotions on and off. Complete stoic approach would be dysfunctional. 00:08:10: Mother of one client fawns and dotes. Sometimes have multiple bosses. Nod to one person, wink to another. 00:09:35: No common jargon with such a disparate work force. Do use hospital-like acronyms. Not together enough as care givers to develop common labor jargon. 00:10:25: People might be taken aback by how people talk about burden of their work. Union meeting good place to “unburden.” Cautions others not to use names given privacy concerns. 1  00:11:35: Discuss issues with family members who tell you what to do. Get burned out and stuck in one place. Hard to find replacement when clients get used to certain set of caregivers. Hard to get time off. 00:12:35: Work leads to lots of black humor with person you care for, if they are amenable. Callahan is cartoonist who does disability humor. 00:14:43: Trying to come up with slogan for local union. Suggested “Uptight Butt Wipes” which was rejected. 00:15:20: Gratified when people thank you at end of the day. Not too keen on personal care. Start out handing bar of soap to person in shower. Later become more hands on and “nurse oriented.” 00:16:26: Challenging because everyone gets worse. No one gets better. Strap on cheerful face and keep going. 00:17:11: Union provides outlet for something more mentally engaging. Union successful in improving wages. Hard to qualify for health insurance. Hours fluctuate. 00:18:50: Lobby days in legislature. Bring clients to talk about effectiveness of programs. Natural support from neighborhood due to familiarity. Home care cost effective when compared with care facilities. 00:20:23: Orientation for new home care workers twice a month. Union provides “political economy of scale.” Way for us to more effectively market our labor, assert our needs and our values. 00:24:06: Everybody ends up here eventually. Sooner or later, someone is dependent or has to give someone else a hand. 00:24:51: Relaxes by riding bike, taking care of dog, shooting pool, solitary things mostly. 00:25:36: Don’t be afraid to “cross Rubicon” on person care. People have more hang ups about poop and blood than they need to. Becomes more routine once you get used to it. 00:26:25: Have to put hands on people. Grow into providing more acute care. People can get frustrated over cleaning people who are messy. Can’t show slightest amount of frustration. Treat as part of your job, don’t take it personally, don’t blame individual. 2  00:28:27: Mother was health care professional, Eagle Scout project dealt with disability. Home care not foreign to me. Work not a calling. Would go elsewhere. Emotional labor hardest part. Must keep cheery outlook even when folks are deteriorating. 00:30:30: End of interview. 3

Esther Lagergren Lipko;Sweden;"PHILLIPS: This is Andrew Phillips and I'm speaking with Esther Lipko, L-I-P-K-O. This is interview number 419 [DP-45]. It's the 30th of August 1989. It's Wednesday. We're commencing this interview at 5:15. And Mrs. Lipko comes from Sweden. Could you tell me your name, where you come from, and what year you immigrated to the United States? LIPKO: All right. My name was Esther Lagergren, and I came to this country in 1924 in the month of August. PHILLIPS: And what year were you born? LIPKO: 1904. PHILLIPS: Could you spell your name, your Swedish, your maiden name? LIPKO: Yes. L-A-G-E-R-G-R-E-N. PHILLIPS: I see. Okay. And could you start by telling me what, could you start by telling me what year you, uh, sorry, what the name of your village was in Sweden? LIPKO: Yeah. It was an island. S-M-O-G-E-N. And it's pronounced Smogen, because it has two dots over the ""O"", so that makes it sound a little different. -- [pp. 2] --  PHILLIPS: Can you tell us a little bit about what your life was like on this island as a little girl? LIPKO: Yeah. Oh, it was beautiful. IT was, the island now is called ""The Pearl of the Ocean"" because, you know, it's water surrounded, all around. And my parents were business people, and so we had a good life. Of course, during the wars we were never in the wars but we helped all these other countries. So actually we, in our home, we couldn't have any more food than the rest of the people b most of them were fishermen on the island. And so we, there was a very congenial place, you know. Everybody was working together on this island, so it was beautiful. So I had a very good life. PHILLIPS: Can you describe your house for us? What was your house like? LIPKO: Well, beautiful. It, uh, it's right by the ocean. Uh, it was a three-story home. We had balconies on the top of the, you know, each end. And we had, let's see, all the homes stay right in the ocean, but it's rocks under. So you think that the houses would be floating, you know, but it's that they're built on these rocks. So it's, when we, in our home, we, when I get up on the third floor, we could see the whole ocean, so it was very, very, I had a good life as a child. PHILLIPS: What did your father do for a living? LIPKO: Uh, he was in the grocery business and the bakery business. And, of course, when he retired then my brother, one of my brothers took over. And if he wants to know something about my brothers I could tell you that. -- [pp. 3] --  PHILLIPS: Tell me a little bit about, how big was the family? LIPKO: We were actually nine children, and two had passed on before I was born, so I didn't see, know anything about them, you know. So, uh, my, I had a brother that was a sea captain and a brother that was an artist, well, he was also a correspondent. And, uh, then I had, then one of my brothers, my youngest brother is older than me. He lives in Chicago. so that's the only one that's over here right now. PHILLIPS: Can you tell us a little bit about your life as a little girl on this island, the kinds of things that you did before you went to school, I mean, before you were of school age. LIPKO: Yeah, well, I was very active, you know, skating and not so much skiing on the island, but skating. We used to skate in the ocean. And the ocean would be, you know, by our place, would be sixty feet deep of ice. And, uh, so that was most of our activity. You know, we didn't have any movies or anything like that, you know. In fact, I never knew what money was till I was fourteen, when I graduated from school. See, I only had a few years schooling in Europe, you know, not too much. PHILLIPS: Tell me why you didn't know anything about money. LIPKO: Well, because we never, there was no place, you know, to spend it. I remember when I graduated from school, I was fourteen, and my mother gave me a little box, matchbox, with money, to go to the mainland and buy my school clothes, you know, for graduation. It was the first money that I ever had because we was, well, we had little stores like, you know, things you buy every day, you know, like we have over here, you buy, kids buy everything, you know, that they can lay their hands on. ( she laughs ) So, uh, so I think that was a good thing, you know. -- [pp. 4] --  PHILLIPS: Tell me about your school. LIPKO: My school. Well, we start school, in those days, I don't know just how it is now, we started school when we were seven and, uh, from seven to fourteen, on the island. And then there's one year, we called it sort of the after school, so there was no, uh, high school or anything, so I didn't have any kind of a, you know, schooling, as far as, well, just reading and writing, you know, and things like that, but there was no, I never, in fact, I, when I came over here, well, you go ahead. I'll come to that later. PHILLIPS: I'm just trying to get, trace out some idea, some sense of what life was like for you and the rhythm of your life on the island. Can you tell me about, for instance, what would happen over the period of a day. Your father would go to work, and what would you do, a sense of what the rhythm of life was like for you on this island. LIPKO: You mean if my Dad wouldn't work, you say? PHILLIPS: Just a little bit more of a sense of what life was like for you on this island. LIPKO: Yeah. Well, it was, you might say normal, you know. There was, uh, there was nobody like, my parents were business people. Most of the people were fishermen, you know. But there was no prejudice. You know, there were no, uh, we all lived so happy together, everyone, all the kids. I can't ever remember having anyone try to hurt anybody. So it was a peaceful situation, you know, just, it was almost, you know, when you see all these things going on now it's almost, you know. So it was, we really had a very, very happy childhood as far as the school, you know, it wasn't much, it was just an ordinary, you know, reading and writing and just to get by, you know. So it, all right, our activities, we took our schooling very seriously. But, uh, then before I came over here there was a kind of a, all these young people wanted to come to America. And, uh, see, my oldest brother sponsored me. I had never seen him because he was, I was born after he left Sweden. See, he left there at sixteen. So then these girls and fellows that came over here from the island, I'd say maybe they were probably about ten, fifteen, and they all went back. I was the only one that stayed. So I was, have always been determined, as a little girl. You asked me about, you know, as a little girl, what my, you know, life was. I was a kind of peculiar little girl because I was very independent, very independent. I was very neat, you know. Everything had to be in place, you know. If anybody touched anything, you know, I would just, you know. So I was kind of a little different than some of the kids because I was, everything had to be just so, you know, and it was very, very compared to my two other sisters, you know. They were different altogether. So I think I carried that through life. -- [pp. 5] --  PHILLIPS: So tell me a little bit about the fisherman. As a little girl did you have much to do with the fishermen on the island? LIPKO: Yeah. They were, you know, they were so nice people, you know. They had, their families were like, you know, they were all sort of all together because sometimes the fishing, well, I could go back a little bit. They, uh, I had some girlfriends that they didn't, you know, it was, that was during the war. I was just, you know, a little girl. And, um, we would have extra food in the house, you know, see, because my dad was a business person. We couldn't keep too much because he kept tab on us, you know. And, uh, we would help out these people, you know. I would take some loaves of bread, you know, and things, and go and give, you know, to the kids, you know, that didn't have anything. You know, because everything was rationed then. Bread is one of the main things, you know. That's really the main food. Bread and potatoes and fish, on the island. That was the main thing. We had meat maybe once a week, not always, you know. So, uh . . . PHILLIPS: How about vegetables? LIPKO: Not much. Uh, I know we would have, my mother, she would put up carrots. You'd put them in the sand, I think, and then save them for the winter, you know, and apples. PHILLIPS: Tell me a bit about that process. LIPKO: Yeah. See, the people would come to the island in fall, say, probably around this time, you know, September, October. And these big boats would have, um, all this, you know, fruits and vegetables, see. So we would buy things and then put it, like apples, you put it in sawdust, I think, in big barrels, so it's safe for the winter, and carrots, and beets and things like that. But salads, no. We never had salads. -- [pp. 6] --  PHILLIPS: So why did you put it in sawdust? LIPKO: Well, to keep it for, uh, so that it wouldn't, you know, to keep it fresh. PHILLIPS: So it wouldn't freeze. LIPKO: Yeah, well, yeah, and also so that, I guess so, yeah, because it's cold, you know. You see, the only time it's warm over there is the month of July. You might say you can depend on that month. Other months are, uh, it could be cold, real cold, even in June or August. So, uh, it, uh, we had to kind of use our heads so that we could have things for the winter, you know. So it was really, we had to be very economical and, uh, so it was a life that, uh, has helped me a lot to concentrate on things, you know, when I came over here, you know, to just go along, you know, and not because, uh, of course, I'm ahead of myself now. You go ahead. PHILLIPS: It's all right. Okay, let's talk a little bit about when you, how old were you when you left this island in Sweden to come to America? LIPKO: I said eighteen but I was nineteen, I think. Yeah, nineteen, yeah. PHILLIPS: Tell me about life for you as a teenager. You went to school, you studied, then you left school on the island. How old were you when you left school? LIPKO: Uh, I was fourteen. PHILLIPS: Fourteen. LIPKO: Fourteen, yeah. PHILLIPS: What happened when you left school? LIPKO: Well, I, I just, we took some little jobs. I remember I was, helped out in the hotel, you know. I was fourteen. And from fourteen to sixteen I did little odds and ends jobs, you know. My dad was very kind of independent. He didn't want us to go. Most of the girls works with fish. You know, they pack them, you know, in ice, you know. My dad would never want us to do that, so we, I worked, helped out in a hotel and did some of the little things that, uh, give me a little extra of money. So I actually didn't do too much over, you know, as far as getting established in a job or anything like that, over there. -- [pp. 7] --  PHILLIPS: And what sort of social life did you have as a young girl on the island? LIPKO: Well, there wasn't much of anything, you know. Uh, the social life, well, it was mostly family life, I think. There was no, we didn't have any movies or any, we had activities in church, you know, and Sunday school, and things like that. But as far as, uh, and then ships would come into the island, you know, and they were mostly military ships. I mean, they were, oh, I'm going to, now I've got something that comes to mind that might be interesting. I was about, let's say I was about fifteen. You know, our activity mostly was swimming in summertime. You know, we swim in the ocean. You know, we swim miles, you know. And, well, this is way back. I was about fifteen. It was during the First World War. And, uh, you know, they had these mines, you know. I don't know if you seen these mines. You see, my brother's a sea captain. He was a sea captain. And, uh, that was some, he picked up a mine and he took it to the island. He had to get permission from the king to take it apart. You know, he was so daring, you know. He would do anything. So on the island he took the mine up. See, a mine is like, you know, it's like a baseball. It has a little thing like this, you know, with a thing in it, and there's a little needle in there, see. And when that needle hit something, you know, the whole thing blows up, see. So, uh, he had, he took one of the mines apart, and he used to, he's got this big thing on the island now with his name on it, you know, that he did that. It was a German mine, I think, yeah. So I was swimming one time and I saw this mine floating, you know, how they bounced, you know. And, uh, I noticed that and I started to run and I had to run, you know, some distance. And they say lightening is faster than sound. I guess you know that. And I saw this just lightning, see, and then that tremendous crash, you know. See, because it's all rocks, you know, on the island. And, uh, so I mean, and other times I would, we would see all these soldiers, you know, floating, you know, in the ocean, you know. All they had on was maybe, you know, they were all beat up, you know, but they would have, uh, some kind of a thing on them to tell them whether they were French or German soldiers. So they, we would go in, go up and tell the police. We had one police on the island. And, uh, so we'd go up and tell him and so he got the other men, you know, to sort of pick them up, you know. And, uh, so we had a little, kind of a little funeral for them, you know. And us kids, you know, we'd go and pick, there was very few flowers on the island. Just between the rocks, you know. And, uh, so we'd go and pick them flowers, and make little bouquets and put them on the graves, you know. And then afterwards we made a monument that was French or German. Of course, we'd never know their names or anything, you know. So some of the things, you know, that, very memorable, you know, that. So we, as I said, it was always something, you know. Of course it was, you know, sort of way back, which I was about fifteen. So it was a, many exciting things, you know. -- [pp. 8] --  PHILLIPS: These soldiers, where had they been killed? LIPKO: Well, on ships, I think. Yeah. And, uh, well, now, I was going to tell you something, but that's, that's afterwards in the Second World War when I was over here. There was a lot of things going on then, you know. PHILLIPS: So tell me, give us a, tell me why it was, how your family came to the decision, or you came to the decision as a young girl, to leave Sweden and come to America. Tell me about that. Let me just put this in context. The war finishes . . . LIPKO: Yeah. PHILLIPS: And then what happens? LIPKO: Well, see, I was around fifteen. No, let's see, uh, '24, see, the war, the first war was over in 1918. Well, then, of course, my dad was still in business, you know. And, um, so, well, I guess there was just not, as I say, after that I guess I just took little, I was just working on the island, you know, with little, sort of little jobs, you know. Of course, I knew, when, I remember, when I worked in this hotel, we were just helping out things, and, uh, one day the cook said to me she wanted to read my palm, you know, which I don't believe in that. But anyway, and she said, ""You know, you're going to go on a long trip."" And I said, ""No, I don't know."" I says, ""I don't think so."" And she says, ""Yes, you are. You're going to go ton on a long trip and it's not going to be too long."" Well, I dismissed it, you know. Well, in the meantime, this older brother that was over here wanted my sister to come because she was older than me. See, well, she had a boyfriend, so she didn't want to go. So I was next in line, you know. But outside of that, as a young girl I, we used to play tennis and I remember the last night in Sweden before I took the ship from island to Goteborg. You see, that's where the big ship was. I was out playing tennis. It was late, about twelve o'clock at night. And my sister comes along and she, I never even thought about coming over here, you know. My sister comes running, she said, ""Didn't you know that you're going to America tomorrow?"" I says, ""Oh, I am?"" I didn't know anything. You know, I didn't, you know. We were thinking about it, you know. My mother did all the worrying about, you know, my clothes and things. So, uh, so it was, uh, all I know, it was, I had a good life. -- [pp. 9] --  PHILLIPS: In other words, there was no anticipation at all. You knew nothing about the fact that you were going to be coming to America. LIPKO: ( she laughs ) No. PHILLIPS: What? How did you know nothing about that? LIPKO: I don't know. I, you know, I, I could tell you stories that you wouldn't believe, you know. Many things that, you know, since I come over here, you know, beginning with Ellis Island. Sometimes I don't know how I ever made it, you know? Because times were tough in those days. You know, they were hard, you know. There was no welfare, thank goodness. I'm glad of that. The people were thinking for themselves. Either you eat or you don't, you know. PHILLIPS: So tell me about leaving Goteborg on the boat, and traveling to Ellis Island. LIPKO: Yeah. Oh, from New York? PHILLIPS: From Sweden. From Goteborg to New York. Is that what happened? LIPKO: Uh, from, uh, from New York to Goteborg. Well, it was, uh, see, some people could come steerage, mostly Jewish people, you know. They had the poor, you know, and they were, they came steerage. I came, they only had one class at that time. There was, you know, the regular class, you know. But, uh, it was, it was really, it was very exciting, you know. I just never thought about, I didn't think about one thing or the other. You know, it was, we were all Swedes, you know. We had a lot of things in common. You know, we had dancing at night, you know, aboard ship. I mean, we had a really good time. Never thought about what was going to happen, you know. All by myself, never seeing, and my brother, I didn't, he was a stranger to me, you know, because I'd never seen him. -- [pp. 10] --  PHILLIPS: I still don't understand how it is that you actually came to leave Sweden to come to America. You said you didn't make any plans at all yourself. Your mother made the plans for you. Is that what you said? LIPKO: Well, yes. As far as, you know, she couldn't make too many plans. She just got my things, my clothes, you know. PHILLIPS: She had a brother already over here. LIPKO: Yeah. I had to. You had to. You wouldn't believe. But you go ahead and, you wanted to ask a question. PHILLIPS: Don't worry about that. Your brother was already over here. He acted as a sponsor. Is that what happened? LIPKO: Yeah. Well, he was my sponsor, see? Now, I could begin with Ellis Island. Do you want me to kind of, okay. We took a ferry. See, we had to stay in New York a month. I think it was three weeks in a month because there was a, um, somebody had some kind of illness, so they wouldn't let us off the ship. So we had to stay there about three weeks, I guess, because it was a long time. Finally we got this ferry that takes us to Ellis Island and how they can keep track of all these people. I don't, you know, everybody spoke their own language, running up the stairs up to Immigration, you know. And I wish so sincerely that they would still have Ellis Island. We would have a so much better country. They would screen people, you would have so much money or you'd go back. I had to have twenty-five dollars. If I didn't have twenty-five dollars, go back on the next ship. They'd screen you, they'd take, I remember they took my eye, you know, they twisted it, you know, to see if there was any, I guess you, they can tell if there was any kind of a sickness or something. And boy they did, they screened you thoroughly. If I had any disease, go back. Any problems, you know, like. And, uh, they give you a big piece of paper, you know, they put it on with some kind of a glue or something, they put it on your chest with your name and where you're going because, you know, all foreign languages. And, uh, they gave you, this is kind of funny, they give you a cup of coffee. They had these big iron cups, you know. They give you some coffee. And then they give you a box, a lunchbox, lunch, you know. And in this lunch was one of these little Jewish rye breads, not sliced, you know, so you had to, you know, something. They gave you a sausage about this long, kind of a rolled-up, you know, and some sardines, without opener. And, you know, you think about it now it's really funny. And here we, you know, take our, you know, take that bread out and take a bite of sausage, you know, and put it back in the box again. And we were sitting on a train. In those days these trains was, you know, sooty. And, uh, we tried to open up these sardines cans. You know, we couldn't open them because, and somebody opened it up with something and we was all over. But all in all it was experiences that, as I say, I wish to this day that we had Ellis Island. The biggest mistake. We wouldn't, why we, all these people, you know, it isn't that. Sure, they should come into this country, but there should be a limit and they should be, the people should be screened a little bit. And I was just reading, I got a paper here from Boston. I don't know if you ever heard of The Christian Science Monitor and I was reading that last night, and I said, ""How much the taxpayers are going to, will have to pay for all these people."" -- [pp. 11] --  PHILLIPS: So tell me about some of your personal experiences on Ellis Island, when you were being screened. Were some people who were with you sent back? LIPKO: Yeah. Oh, yes. A lot of people were sent back. In fact, there was a girl that was on my boat, on my ship that her sister was supposed to wire her some, that twenty-five dollars, and she never did, and they were going to send her back. A real nice looking girl. And, uh, one of the fellows gave her the money so they wouldn't send her back, yeah. But, oh, I tell you, there was no mercy there, you know. There was just, uh, so, as I say, I really felt very, very sad that Ellis Island was taken back because . . . PHILLIPS: Did they treat you well? LIPKO: Yeah. You know, we didn't get much, but they were, as I said, I can't understand how they could keep people organized that you go here and nobody understand each other. There was all kinds of languages. And, uh, I was never scared, you know. I was never afraid. I don't know. I guess I was, I never had fear. Even, my life now, you know, I never really had fear of anything. But it was, uh, as I said, they treated us well, but I can't see how they could understand all these people, you know, and keep track of them. PHILLIPS: Okay. I'm going to turn the tape over now. END OF SIDE ONE BEGINNING OF SIDE TWO PHILLIPS: We're continuing on side two with Mrs. Lipko, interview number 419 [DP-45]. -- [pp. 12] --  LIPKO: Pardon? PHILLIPS: I was just putting identification on the tape. LIPKO: Oh. PHILLIPS: Okay. I'm going to turn the tape over now. END OF SIDE ONE BEGINNING OF SIDE TWO PHILLIPS: We're continuing on side two with Mrs. Lipko, interview number 419. [DP-45] LIPKO: Pardon? PHILLIPS: I was just putting identification on the tape. LIPKO: Oh. PHILLIPS: Okay, let's continue now. Let's, perhaps, talk about some of your experience after Ellis Island. When you leave Ellis Island what happens? LIPKO: Well, of course, I came to Chicago, you know, where my brother was. Then, uh, you know, I couldn't speak one word English, you know, not one word. And, uh, school in those days were very expensive, high school, you know. You really had to have a lot of money. And so I did some housework so I could learn the language. And, uh, I guess I probably was what you might call a fast learned because it didn't, in about three months I could speak good English. But I tried, you know. Put little words together, you know, and I couldn't afford to go to school. So I worked in housework for about a year and, uh, I had many experience there that, you know, I, sometimes I didn't last too long because, you know, I did a lot of dumb things, you know, things that I never, you know, had done before. Because in my home, you know, we never, I never scrubbed floors and things like that, you know, because I wasn't, you know, I was working outside. And my folks had a, some people that did work, you know, in the house, because they were busy. So I did a lot of dumb things that, uh, I guess if I knew better I wouldn't have done. But it, uh, sometimes I'd last two weeks, you know, sometimes I'd last one week, you know. But anyway I learned, I learned a lot. I learned things that probably would have took a girl that went to college, you know, because it, uh, something that I, you know, an everyday thing that I had to put up with. So it, uh, oh, yeah, I had many, many, many experiences that . . . -- [pp. 13] --  PHILLIPS: So when you actually, you're in Chicago, you're working, doing cleaning work . . . LIPKO: Yeah. Well, it was mostly the people were working. There were some lawyers, and there were some bankers' families and so on, and they had children. So mostly, you know, I did things in the house, but watched the kids too, you know, so that . . . PHILLIPS: How long did you do this work for? LIPKO: For about a year. PHILLIPS: And then what happened? LIPKO: Oh, then I, uh, oh, we had a factory not too far from us that they made Babe Ruth candies. I don't know if they still have Babe Ruth. Are they still making Babe Ruth candies? I don't know. And, um, so I worked there for about, for a few years and, um, and I met some girls and we, uh, we roomed together then. And once in a while I'd go over to my brother's, you know, his family, and stay with them for a while, you know. But I, uh, as I say, I was always, you know, you always had to work, you know. PHILLIPS: What sort of living did your brother do, what work? LIPKO: Uh, he was an interior decorator, my oldest brother, yeah. So, uh, and he had one girl, one daughter, that's on my, maybe you want to ask something, but I was going to break in here or something. But anyway, he had one daughter, she was four when I came over. So we kind of knew each other, you know, from that point, see. But we lost track of each other, even though she lives in Chicago. Beautiful, beautiful girl. She was Miss, uh, she was in for Miss America but she didn't want to go into it. She was Miss Chicago, you know, very. And I hadn't seen her in forty years. One day, last Christmas, I got a letter and it said that she had looked up my name in Denver and, uh, she's a broker. And she said that, uh, she just wanted to contact me, you know, because her parents, you know, her brother, you know, my brother, her Dad, had passed on, so she was all by herself. In fact, I got a letter today from her. And she's so, she said that she's all by herself and, uh, she's, I guess, worth a fortune, you know. And she said that, uh, I'm the only aunt she has. She said that she wants to make out her will. So she'd get me, you know, the, and, uh, but, of course, she'll be seventy here next. I got a card, the 19th of September, I just bought a card for her birthday. And, uh, so, as I say, I mean, I don't, you know, money to me doesn't mean a thing. -- [pp. 14] --  PHILLIPS: So tell me about life during the Depression in America. You were here then? LIPKO: Oh, yeah. That was, that was hard. That was hard. That was, uh, my husband Ben, he worked for General Motors, Chevrolet Division, in Detroit. And they had a strike that lasted two years. That was, that was hard. So he did some odd, you know, odds and ends jobs., they thought maybe the thing would be over, you know, and it dragged on and dragged on. And, uh, that was, that was hard. It was very, very, very hard. There was no, uh, and they did have welfare in those days, but not much, you know. Either you had to be a Republican, or you had to be a Democrat. You know, I mean, like, for instance, the Democrats would give people, uh, not that we were just destitute, but, you know, it was tough. Democrats would give you extra stuff so that you turned Democrat, see. And the Republicans, you know, they would try to, you know, I mean, there was just, there was, all political. All, everything was political. And, um, so, of course, my husband, he was Democrat, and I was Republican. So we, you know, I mean, it was, I would, I used to bake bread, you know, huge loaves of bread, sell them for ten cents so we could buy something else with that ten cents, you know. I mean, that was, but, what, it was hard, but experiences that really you couldn't buy that for money, you know what I mean. Really, it made real people, you know, to think. Now you can just go down, you know, and get anything you want. But, uh, you see, people talked about, you know, Sweden is socialist, you know. If you want me to say something about it. Well, socialism, I don't know if you know anything about it, you know the difference between . . . -- [pp. 15] --  PHILLIPS: We don't really have to talk about that. I'm more interested in talking about some of your experiences during the Depression and after the Depression. LIPKO: Yeah, yeah. Well, as I say, it was hard because the people lost their homes, just like they do to this day, you know. PHILLIPS: But you didn't lose your home. LIPKO: Well, we rented for the time being, and then we had, we had a home, it wasn't too big. It was kind of small. It was a nice little place, but, and so we didn't pay much, you know. But there were some houses there where . . . PHILLIPS: Do you remember how much you did pay? LIPKO: Pardon? PHILLIPS: Do you remember how much you paid? It's not important. LIPKO: No. I remember when we, down payment on it was one hundred dollars. PHILLIPS: But you were buying your own house. LIPKO: Yeah. We were buying, we paid down a hundred dollars. There was a payment, you know, mortgage payment. And, uh, but that was like probably one thousand dollars then, I don't know. But it was very, it was, our monthly payments, I don't know, probably was about twenty-five dollars or something like that. So you can't compare, you know, with today's. PHILLIPS: So after the Depression did life improve very rapidly for you after the Depression? What, how did life affect you? LIPKO: Uh, yeah. Then after so long, of course, my husband went back to work and, uh, some, that, we lived in Detroit, in, Detroit, Michigan. It was a suburb of Detroit. Hazel Park was the name of it. So we had, as I say, we had a, it was, you know, life was beginning to shape up. You know, get back to some of the things that we couldn't have bought, you know, and everything. We did have a car which was, you know, was not the best but, uh, so, uh, but then, of course, you know, then I had three children. I have a son now that's a veterinarian in Washington. And, uh, and my daughters. So when they got to be, you know, go their own way, you know, and do, why, things always got better, you know, because expenses, you know. So but I wouldn't trade anything for coming over to this country, you know. Because that was, even though I could have had, maybe, you know, I could have had more personal things, you know, if I'd been over there, and things like that but, uh, I was always out for adventure, you know, and I got it, too, you know. Even though sometimes it looked hard, it was hard at times but, uh, it was, I really, you know, I really enjoyed it. I enjoyed this country. It could be so much better if, uh, I do like politics a lot, you know, and when I read some of these things that things could, if people only used their heads, you know, it could be a better country. -- [pp. 16] --  PHILLIPS: Okay. I think that's about it, is it? LIPKO: No! PHILLIPS: Tell me, what else? LIPKO: You bet, I, I'm sitting on top of the world, you know. But when I read some of these things that, uh, that could be, I don't say that these people coming over to this country, you know. But I think that it should be a level off a little more. You see, they are taking in so many . . . PHILLIPS: I think I'll finish the interview there. We can talk about this, but we don't need this part of it on tape. When you're talking about now we don't really need on tape. LIPKO: Oh. PHILLIPS: I'm really only interested in your own experiences, your own . . . LIPKO: Oh, yeah, oh, yeah. So it's off now. PHILLIPS: It will be. That finishes interview number 419 [DP-45] with bells. ( a clock chimes ) You can count the bells. We've finished at six o'clock. "

And some people made screws and bolts and they made an awful lot of everything in different parts of the factory. And in one part of the factory they made material, wood material.

And she used to come over, she came, she was a Lutheran. She was an, ah, of course Russia was Catholic, Roman Catholic and you know they were very strict against the, the Lutheran people see? So she escaped over that Baltic Sea and come over to Sweden, but she, she was a nun really. And she was so nice. She went from house to house and she made up clothes and she took old clothes and washed them and took 'em apart and made clothes for younger kids out of it. That's all she did, went from house to house to do that. She was very nice person. So from then on we celebrate that the 13th of January.

GUSTAFSON: A wedding? Oh, yes. LEVINE: What was that like? GUSTAFSON: That was like, well, in the church, in the Lutheran church, the church had a crown, a gold crown, a little gold, beautiful, really gold crown, and if they bride want to she could wear that when she got married in the church. LEVINE: How about funerals? Were the funerals any different than they are here? GUSTAFSON: The funerals. Of course there, in Sweden, you know, they don't pay for anything. I mean, everything the government is taking care of, see. So there was the same as here. You know they had a service and the, the funeral parlors was, the cemeteries, were usually around the church, the cemeteries, as a rule. They were around the church. So all my, all my relatives that I have in Sweden that passed away - my mother, father, they're buried in one of the lots that were around that big church, see? It's an immense cemetery there. They usually were around the churches. LEVINE: And do you have any other memories of your father besides when you were four and a half and you took him his coffee? GUSTAFSON: Yeah, every Sunday morning, every Sunday morning, of course we had to go, we didn't have running water you know, so we had to get our water then, see. But the water, we had a, a well, a little ways away from where we lived, in the, in the woods. And that well was so, it was such a beautiful, was a good water. So clear and so nice water. People went there with their buckets, you know, and collected water used for drinking, see? And every Sunday morning my father and I used to go to that well. (Laughing) And I can remember I want to look just like my father all the time, see? -- [pp. 14] --  LEVINE: You wanted to look like him? GUSTAFSON: Like the way he did, I did. So when he went out he had his hat even on the side of his head. So I had a white hat. A white hat that looked like fur. But I guess it wasn't fur. But it looked like a fur hat anyway. And the minute I come outside the door, I looked to see if my mother saw me, then I put mine (laughing) on the side of my head. And then when I, when we come back again, I forgot to straighten it out, see. So I can remember my mother looked at my father, said, Oskar, can you see what that girl doing now? She's trying to look just like you, she said. That wasn't, that wasn't nice you know, for a little girl like me to have my hat on the side like a man, no. Oh, I'll never forget it. And I was only four and a half years old when he died. Can you imagine? And I can remember his face, even. I got a grandson by the name of David. He looks so much like his grandfather. That when we're together I can't help but look at him all the time. END SIDE A BEGIN SIDE B LEVINE: What did he look like? GUSTAFSON: He was an ordinary person, just an ordinary  But always happy. He was always happy. LEVINE: Do you remember any particular foods that your mother made or that you remember enjoying when you were a little girl? Any dishes? GUSTAFSON: Ya, we had beautiful dishes. I don't know how we got them, but they call it [Ekdah]. They came from England. -- [pp. 15] --  LEVINE: Oh. But I mean particular foods. GUSTAFSON: Oh, you mean food. You mean food. Well, know, of course you know meatball, Swedish meatball (laughs). We had that. And we had the regular, we had the pot roast and regular dinner like we have here. LEVINE: Did you have a favorite kind of food? GUSTAFSON: Yea. We had a lot of fish. Because we had, went fishing all the time. We ate a lot of fish. LEVINE: Now, did you go to school. GUSTAFSON: Yea, I went to school. And we had to walk quite a while to school then. There was at least two miles to school; more probably. And we walked. And in the winter time when there was, because there was a lot of ah, ah, streams and things like that. So then when they were frozen we used to go, we used to go to school on our, our skates. We used to skate to school sometimes, see. Because there was at the end of that stream, the school. LEVINE: And how long did you stay in school? GUSTAFSON: Well, this is years ago, remember. We had to, we start school eight in the morning, had to stay 'til four o'clock in the afternoon. But we had an hour off for dinner. And we had some time off for rest in the morning and afternoon. But not much, I guess, about fifteen minutes probably. When we could go out to play. But then in the middle of the day we had an hour off. But we start at eight o'clock in the morning 'til four o'clock in the afternoon. So in the wintertime it was dark when we, when we walked home. -- [pp. 16] --  LEVINE: And what did you do after you finished school? GUSTAFSON: After I finished school? Well, I worked in the restaurant. I worked, I helped, I was a helper to the cook. Spare cook or whatever you call it. And after that I took that up so I did a lot of cooking. I used to, be head for cooking in the, in some restaurants and I come here, I used to go out and cook here too. LEVINE: Were these restaurants in Borgord? GUSTAFSON: Yes. But not a big one in Borgord. But in the next city there, [Finsbogen] was a large one, was a big restaurant we used to go to. LEVINE: So you met your husband in Sweden. GUSTAFSON: Oh, ya. He was from Borgord. He was from the same place as I was. But of course, he was older than I was. Then as I grow older we started to go together. I can remember when he met me when I was a young girl. He used to say, you know, I'm going to marry you. And we used to laugh together, you know it? But that was all. We didn't go out together or anything. But he just told me, I'm gonna marry you. LEVINE: And did you like him? GUSTAFSON: Ya, of course I did. We were married fifty years. We never had any, never was anything bother between us. Never. I don't believe in that. And my children is the same way. They're very happy married people, all of them. So I believe that, their home makes it. You know, by the home you come from. LEVINE: What was your husband's name? -- [pp. 17] --  GUSTAFSON: Harold. LEVINE: Harold. GUSTAFSON: Harold, Harold Gustafson. And his father was a contractor in Sweden. And he didn't, we didn't have, on my husband's side there was nobody over here when we left there. And we had no reason to go because he had, he had a good job. But I don't know. There's a Viking in you, you know. You want to see something else, see. And I had a sister and brother that had gone over here, and at that time, around 1927, there were a lot of people that left for the United States. But ah, we were only going to be here two years. LEVINE: Why was that? GUSTAFSON: No. That's all we were going, we were just going to see United States and see how it was and go back home again. And we came in 1927 and then they had they Depression here, 1929. That was terrible. LEVINE: Well, first before we talk about the Depression, tell me about leaving Borgord, and do you remember leaving? Do you remember packing up to leave? GUSTAFSON: Oh, yes. Oh, yes. I remember that all right. We sold all our home, our furnishings and everything. And there was spotless, everything we sold you know. We were not married that long, see. And then we walked from there to my mother's place. And that was outside, so on that side of the city, it was a farmland so there was, there was a field on one side of the street, the, the, the road. And then there was some woods on the other side. And this was in the last part of April. And the spring comes early in Sweden than it does here, see. So all those fields were nice and green. I'll never forget it. And the sun was hitting. And I'll never it, how I started to cry. And my husband said, why are you crying. I said, what do we know what we're going into, Harold, I said, look at how beautiful it is. And what we left. Now, what do you think? So ya. I didn't tell you, when we come over to (laughs) New York. We were on the (pauses)  I never forget that. We never, I never saw a black man before in all my life, you know. There was no black people in Sweden, see. After we gone through Sears Island, you know, and the long row there, just going through there, and I remember this black man, you know, helped us with the luggage when we come to New York. And we had just changed our money for American money. And you know, the dimes, you know, are so small and then the nickels were larger, and we thought, you know, the nickels were worth more than a dime. (laughing) When that man had helped us, we didn't know, we didn't know what else was, so my husband gave him three nickels instead of the dimes, you know. And I'll never forget that he said something, though I don't know what he said. But it wasn't something nice, because I could tell on his face. But we didn't know the difference, see. He thought we would give him more. Three nickels and three dimes. And then we, they took us all to a hotel in New York. -- [pp. 18] --  LEVINE: Well, do you remember, do you know what you brought with you? GUSTAFSON: From Sweden? LEVINE: Yeah. GUSTAFSON: Yes, we brought, I had a lot of antiques from Sweden. I always like the antiques. And we brought a lot of that. We had three big wooden boxes full of stuff with us. With rugs and towels and my mother made a, some dishtowels and everything. And I had all of those with me, and a couple dozen of those. And lot of the linen tablecloths she had made and all that. Some, I don't think I had some curtain with me. But linen tablecloths. An awful lot of linen tablecloths. And, and some dishes that we didn't want to throw away, that probably was given to, you know. And knick-knacks that we didn't want to throw away and things like that. I can remember that the man, he took a look, they were kind of late in the afternoon when we, when it was our turn to go through the custom in New York. And he took a look at those three things that we said, and he said, I wish I could go through 'em he said, but get going. He said, get out of here. (Laughing). LEVINE: Well, do you remember anything about the voyage. When you were on the ship? GUSTAFSON: Oh, yes. Oh, yes. (laughing) I, there was my husband and my two boys. We had one cabin together. The kids were small, see. But there were some other people that we know that came too, that we know from Sweden. And they, they were so sick. The, the, the place was, it was a mess, they were so terrible sick. And my husband and my kids, we were not sick at all. When we come down to the dining room, they were hardly anybody in the dining room. People were sick. They were seasick. And then after a while, I thought,and they aren't ever going to get over this you , know, to be sea sick. I thought it smelled terrible, [ ] cabin, see. So then (laughs), I find out they've been drinking a lot too. (chuckling) Of course, my husband and I, we didn't drink, see. So that probably was more in that, that these were both that seasick. Oy, yo, yo. Terrible. -- [pp. 19] --  LEVINE: And what were your son's names. Your children, who came with you? GUSTAFSON: Their, one's name was Bertil, and Jan, my oldest son is Jan, and the other son was Bertil. And they're both passed away now, and their wives have passed away too. So I only got my youngest son, and his wife. The sons. But I got plenty of grandchildren. And they're very, very nice to me. They're very nice to me. LEVINE: So do you remember when the ship.. The name of the ship was the what? GUSTAFSON: Huh? LEVINE: The name of your ship? GUSTAFSON: Drottningholm. You got that. LEVINE: Drottningholm. Right. And do you remember when that ship came into the New York harbor? GUSTAFSON: Oh, yes. I remember when we saw the Statue of Liberty, we first saw that. And everybody was up on the deck looking at it, you know. And I said, Harry coming into New York now, see. LEVINE: And tell me anything you can remember about Ellis Island. GUSTAFSON: Well, when you first come in, there, we had to, before we, we went, we went into the, they made us go into some rooms, see. And the ladies had to go into one room and the men another room, and we had to go doctors examine. The doctors examined us. I remember that. And of course I had the two children. I could take them with me when I went in. And then we met my husband again. Then we had to go, and, and from, show our identification, who we were, you know, our passports and all that. And we had to have so much money to get in, we had to show 'em where we were goin'. The name of the people where we were going. We had to show 'em that. And we had to have, we had to have, two hundred dollars apiece in American money to come in. -- [pp. 20] --  LEVINE: So, do you remember anything specific about the examinations? GUSTAFSON: Well, we went into the doctor and there wasn't much of an examination. But they listened to our heart (there is a nursing home announcement in the background) and they examine us. It wasn't much of an examination, but we had to go through it anyway. (loud voices in the hallway) I can't remember. But, when they exam you, naked. You wasn't naked. LEVINE: No. GUSTAFSON: No. LEVINE: We're going to pause for a minute because there's a lot of noise outside right now. Okay, we're resuming now after some noise in the hall has stopped. So, did someone meet you? When you were told you could go ahead, where did you go? GUSTAFSON: In New York? Well, there was a man there that took us to, took us to a hotel. I can't remember the name of the hotel. That took us to the hotel. And ah, signed us in there. And we had to stay to that hotel into the morning. LEVINE: Did you ever have any contact with the Seamen's Institute? GUSTAFSON: What? LEVINE: The Seaman's Institute? It's a Swedish organization in New York? Did you ever have any contact with that? GUSTAFSON: I don't know. I might be them that took us. I don't know. There was somebody that took us. LEVINE: And what was it like there, where you stayed? GUSTAFSON: There was like a hotel. We had a room and stayed overnight. And they would give us food there and everything. And then the next morning they took us and put us on the train to Bos-, to Worcester. -- [pp. 21] --  LEVINE: Now, was this mainly Swedish people in the hotel where you were? GUSTAFSON: Yes. Ya.

I was the oldest one, so. And then after that my brother, it was a few years after that he came. So. LEVINE: Do you remember leaving Sweden? LAWRENCE: Me? LEVINE: You remember saying good-bye to your family? LAWRENCE: (she laughs) Ja. And, but they, we went back, after I got married we went back a couple of times. After the, the Depression here, my husband didn't want to go on welfare, so we sold everything that we had went back to Sweden and stayed for two years. LEVINE: Oh. Okay... LAWRENCE: There, there was man that worked for (Swedish) Sweden. And he said, I'm going back, he says, why don't you go, too. So we sold everything and back we went. And I enjoyed every single day of it after that. -- [pp. 12] --  LEVINE: Okay. Well, tell me about when you first, where did you leave from? When you left your, your home, home... LAWRENCE: Lysekil. LEVINE: Yeah. LAWRENCE: Ja. LEVINE: And then how did you, how did you go to the port? How did you get to the ship? LAWRENCE: Well, we, in the little town that I, we had to walk down to the water there, ship, to the, where the water's laying. LEVINE: Oh, you walked there? LAWRENCE: Oh, ja. It didn't take more that five minutes. LEVINE: Uh-huh. And what was the name of the ship that you came... LAWRENCE: Kungsholm. Kungsholm. LEVINE: Kungsholm. And what, what, were you, when you were on the ship, do you remember anything about the crossing, coming to this country? LAWRENCE: Yes. We were four in, in a room. And it was two that were very, very sick. We had to take them up because we couldn't stand it. It was too much. And we had quite a bit of a storm. So the boat was rolling. But otherwise everything was fine. LEVINE: Now, you were travelling alone? LAWRENCE: Yes. LEVINE: You were by yourself when you came? LAWRENCE: Ja. LEVINE: How did you feel about coming to this country when you were coming here? LAWRENCE: Well, it was, I don't know what it, well, kind of different I would say. And when I come to Hyde Park, my aunt there, she worked in a factory sort of making man's clothes. So she get me in there. But my eyes started to get bad, so I, I had to quit. So I took a house work with a family with four children. One morning I get up quite early, did the washing, hung it out. And when the man come down for breakfast, he looked out, said, ""Did you wash?"" And it was fourteen below zero, and I didn't know. That didn't mean anything to me. Fourteen below zero. I put the clothes on the line and it was hanging there stiff as can be. (she laughs) If you know what I mean. -- [pp. 13] --  LEVINE: Yeah. LAWRENCE: So when, when, in the afternoon I had to take them in. I could have stood, but the man used to wear union suits. I could have stand it in the corner, and it was all stiff. (she laughs) But everything was fine. LEVINE: Well, you were used to the cold. LAWRENCE: Well, we had cold in Sweden, too, so, that didn't make a difference to me. When you're young you don't think about anything like that, so. LEVINE: Yeah. LAWRENCE: So, and then they moved to Worcester, went to Worcester. LEVINE: Well, do you remember when the ship came into the New York Harbor? Do you remember when you were on the ship... LAWRENCE: Ja. LEVINE: ...and it came into New York? LAWRENCE: Ja. LEVINE: Do you... LAWRENCE: And then we went into Ellis Island. LEVINE: What do you remember about that? LAWRENCE: Well, all I can remember is that quite a few of us went down, down there. And if I'm not mistaken we had a cup of coffee. And after that there was a boat to, outside Worcester. We had a boat ride from Ellis Island to Boston, but I can't remember the name of the boat. LEVINE: Do you remember being examined at Ellis Island? LAWRENCE: No, not that I can remember. LEVINE: Uh-huh. LAWRENCE: No. LEVINE: And, did, no one met you? You were just put on another boat... -- [pp. 14] --  LAWRENCE: Yes. LEVINE: ...directed to another boat to go to Boston? LAWRENCE: Ja. It was a small boat. It wasn't far from Ellis Island to Boston. LEVINE: Do, do you have any other impressions of Ellis Island? LAWRENCE: No. We didn't stay long (unintelligible). We just was in, in the room when we had a cup of coffee and that's all. LEVINE: Now did you know anybody else who was on your ship... LAWRENCE: I have no idea who they were. LEVINE: Yeah LAWRENCE: It was all stranger to me. LEVINE: Yeah. Did you speak any English? LAWRENCE: (she laughs) You can hear my English now? LEVINE: Well, your English is fine now. LAWRENCE: So. LEVINE: Well, now, so, what was it like for a young, a young woman of twenty-three to be travelling alone to this country and going to Boston on... LAWRENCE: Well, you didn't think much about anything like that. You just think that you were coming to another country. That's all. And the first Sunday I was here, they took me down to Revere Beach. (she laughs) And I was, the women were, were dressed in union suits, almost... LEVINE: They were like bathing suits? LAWRENCE: Bathing. (she laughs) I couldn't believe when I saw them. They had almost dress, with long stockings and union suit that went way. (she indicates) LEVINE: What, what kind of bathing suits had you seen in Sweden? What was the difference? -- [pp. 15] --  LAWRENCE: Well, we had the bathing suits, of course. And many times we went without. That all depends on where we were. So, when it was warm we never heard of any bathing suits. But after a while we had the bathing suits on. So. It's a different life. LEVINE: Yeah. LAWRENCE: But I had a wonderful life here. LEVINE: Can you think of anything else struck you as different when you were first, when you were new to this country? LAWRENCE: Well, well, first there was the language, of course. You didn't know anything, if it was telling you anything or whatever it was. I didn't know what (unintelligible). That's all. LEVINE: And how was it for you learning English? LAWRENCE: Well, you had to pick up like a little here and little there. You can here it now, how I can't express, explain everything even now, either. But I'm doing the best I can. LEVINE: You do very well. I, there's no problem. LAWRENCE: And I have two wonderful daughters. LEVINE: Okay. Well, first tell me how, you got a job right away. First in the factory and then you went to work for the family, right? LAWRENCE: Ja. LEVINE: And then, when along the way did you meet your husband? LAWRENCE: In Sweden. We went together for four years, two years in Sweden. LEVINE: Oh, so he was your boyfriend when you came here? LAWRENCE: He, ja, he came here two years after I did. -- [pp. 16] --  LEVINE: Ah. Okay. So you, you planned that you would come here and then he would come here? LAWRENCE: I didn't know that he was coming, but he did come. LEVINE: Did he come because you were here? LAWRENCE: Ja. LEVINE: What was his name? LAWRENCE: John. LEVINE: John. And, so John Lawrence? LAWRENCE: Well, we say it was Lowrenson [PH]. LEVINE: Lowrenson? LAWRENCE: Ja. LEVINE: How do you spell that? LAWRENCE: L-O, Lo, L-R-N, C-, C-, or what it's call it [sic]. S-O-N. Lowrenson. LEVINE: Lowrenson. Uh-huh. And then when he came here he changed it? He changed his name... LAWRENCE: Ja. Because his name, I don't what happened, but he, he called himself Johannson. Johannson. LEVINE: Uh-huh. LAWRENCE: But he changed that when he came here because there was too many Johannsons. When he was working and so forth, he went over to his father's name. Lowrenson. But he changed that to Lawrence, instead of to Lowrenson, because it was harder to spell Lowrenson than it is to spell Lawrence. LEVINE: And so he had changed his name from Lowrenson to Lawrence before you married him? LAWRENCE: No. After. LEVINE: After. So for a while your name was Lowrenson, too? LAWRENCE: Ja. LEVINE: Uh-huh. And then, tell me how you met him. -- [pp. 17] --  LAWRENCE: Huh? LEVINE: How did you meet in the beginning? LAWRENCE: In Sweden? LEVINE: Yeah. LAWRENCE: Well, (unintelligible) that's a small town, so almost everybody knows everybody else. And we had a big party going to get money. And... LEVINE: What was the money for? LAWRENCE: Huh? LEVINE: What was the money for? LAWRENCE: Well, for different things. They gave to charity and they gave to this and that and, can I say it? LEVINE: Yeah. LAWRENCE: That we belonged to the Temperance Society, if you know what that is. LEVINE: Yes. LAWRENCE: No drinking, no smoking. So that's, that's what we were doing. Little of everything like that. LEVINE: So you met, you, you were both involved with the Temperance Society? You were both... LAWRENCE: Oh, ja. And we had a big, large ham in Worcester. Eggs. Two, two or three of them. Temperance. So there was no drinking here in our house. No smoking, either, for that matter. So, but all those is gone. There's no more temperance anymore. LEVINE: Well, it sounds like... LAWRENCE: Which is too bad. LEVINE: It sounds like that was very important to you. LAWRENCE: You said it. Ja. No. We just (unintelligible) like that. LEVINE: Were there Temperance Societies in Sweden as well? -- [pp. 18] --  LAWRENCE: Oh, ja. Oh, that's a big, there still are. Oh, there, that's a big organization. The temperance. I wish it was here, too. Ja, we had a quite a, we had three temperance lodges here, Temperance Society.

LAWRENCE: She's been at Astra Pharmaceutical for four, four years. No. More than that. She's been forty-six, forty-six years I think it is at Astra. We know the owner that started the Astra.

LAWRENCE: The Depression here. Was it 192'... LEVINE: It could have been '29 or '30's. LAWRENCE: Ja. See, he sold everything because my husband didn't want to go on welfare. He didn't want that on his record. So we sold everything and went back to Sweden and stayed for two years. And then come back, because there was a man from Chicago that told my husband, I'm going back. He says, why don't you do the same. So here we are. LEVINE: Now what was it like for you going back and living in Sweden again? LAWRENCE: Well, it was kind of different. LEVINE: What was different? LAWRENCE: But you get used to it after all, so. LEVINE: What were the differences that, that you had to get used to again when you went back? LAWRENCE: Well, that I can't really say. There was much... LEVINE: Well, did you live in the same, I mean, was the way you lived different? I mean, the house and the... LAWRENCE: Well, we had to have the tenement. You only get one room, and it was a real small one. And then the kitchen. That's all. That's not like here. So. But. LEVINE: How about like electricity and water and all the things that... LAWRENCE: Well, that's are all was the same as here. -- [pp. 21] --  LEVINE: It was all the same. LAWRENCE: Ja. LEVINE: Uh-huh. LAWRENCE: So.

LAWRENCE: You said it. LEVINE: Uh-huh. LAWRENCE: Ja. LEVINE: Well, do you know why you were so happy to come back? LAWRENCE: Well, the living is different. So we had a wonderful living here. And still have for that matter. Now I won't say it, but we had a wonderful, wonderful home life. Two very nice children. So. LEVINE: Was there a large Swedish population in Worcester when you were... LAWRENCE: There was, ja, there was, there was quite a few Swedish people here then. We had three, I think it was three Temperance Societies here. LEVINE: Were they mostly Swedish people in the Temperance Society? LAWRENCE: Ja. Ja. Well, you can, maybe somebody else. I, I wouldn't know. But the one that I belonged to were all Swedes. So. Ja. (unintelligible) I had a wonderful life here. LEVINE: Now, what do you feel proud of? -- [pp. 22] --  LAWRENCE: Huh? LEVINE: What do you feel proud of? LAWRENCE: Well, everything is nice. I won't say anything. The people is nice, but, (unintelligible) that we belong to, well, you know what I mean. LEVINE: The people that you belong to?

We were citizen here. Ja. Ja. And he worked at Norton for many years. He was a wonderful worker. LEVINE: So he was happy in this country, too. LAWRENCE: Ja. Ja. So, that's the story. LEVINE: Okay. Well, now, what do you, how do you think it made a difference to you, the fact that you grew up in Sweden and you came here when you were twenty-three years old and... LAWRENCE: Well, it's hard to tell. It's an awful lot of difference in working conditions, there and here. I had wonderful places here that I worked. So. As I say, otherwise, it's. (she laughs) You're recording all this? LEVINE: Yes. Yeah, it's all of interest. Now, let's see. Is there anything else that you can say? Are there qualities that you have that you consider Swedish, and are there qualities that you have that you consider American? How do you think about yourself that way? LAWRENCE: Well, I would almost say they're about the same. I would say. Ja. -- [pp. 23] --  LEVINE: What kinds of things do you carry over from Sweden? Are there any customs, or any ways of doing things... LAWRENCE: Well, there are a lot of, lot of Swedish customs that, it's here, take them over here many times. Like they, they made similar parties that they have here. You don't know anything about those, do you? LEVINE: No. Tell me about them. LAWRENCE: Well, they dress up in costumes, and have different dances and different, they all (unintelligible) is very important in here in this count, in Sweden. And they carry over. So there are a lot, a lot of Swedish things going on here, too. LEVINE: Oh. LAWRENCE: You can only look at the museum up there at the, ja, what's going on there. So. LEVINE: Uh-huh. Did you and your husband and children, did you, did you participate in these Swedish... LAWRENCE: Huh? LEVINE: Did your, did you participate in these Swedish festivities? LAWRENCE: No, not much. Well, we were, it made similar things that we have down there. The Temperance Society did quite a bit of doings at midsummer and so forth. LEVINE: Did they have parties? Did they have, where people dressed up in costumes and... LAWRENCE: Some of them were in Swedish costumes. Ja. So. LEVINE: How about cooking? Do you still cook some Swedish dishes? LAWRENCE: Oh, some, oh, ja. We do that, too. -- [pp. 24] --  LEVINE: Yeah? What kind of Swedish cooking did you continue making in this country? LAWRENCE: (she laughs) You heard about ""sill?"" LEVINE: Sill? LAWRENCE: Herring? LEVINE: Yes. LAWRENCE: That's, that's good. LEVINE: Uh-huh. LAWRENCE: And otherwise it's about the same. So. LEVINE: Swedish meatballs? LAWRENCE: You said it. (they laugh) Ja. That's all the daughter is what doing now. She had the house now when I moved out. So, she had, so happy to, she had to do her own cooking now. My mother did before. So. Ja. LEVINE: And, when you look back over your life, what makes you feel very good? LAWRENCE: Well, I would say that I have a very nice home life here the whole time. So, a wonderful husband and nice children, and so forth, and a wonderful son-in-law, if I can say it. LEVINE: Oh, good. LAWRENCE: Ja. LEVINE: Did your children marry Swedish men? LAWRENCE: No. LEVINE: No. LAWRENCE: She married to, he's German. Born here, of course. They met while playing together when they were two years old. LEVINE: Oh.

The other one was born in Sweden. LEVINE: Oh. LAWRENCE: Ja. Well, we didn't want a, well, as I said before we didn't want to go on welfare. So we went back home. LEVINE: And what did you husband do when you went back home to Sweden? LAWRENCE: He worked in the big factory. So. LEVINE: And did you work when you went, no, you, you had your child. LAWRENCE: My husband didn't want me to work. He said you stay home, and, so. Ja. So now you know my life. LEVINE: And how is your life now? How is your life at this stage?

LEVINE: And I'm here in Highland Park in Mrs. Losso's home. LOSSO: Yeah. LEVINE: And this is Janet Levine for the National Park Service. Okay, if you would start, Mrs. Losso, by saying where you were born in Italy. LOSSO: Oh, I was born in a small town. Well, it wasn't small. It's a providence of Genoa. Well, that, and there's a small town in between that. I don't know if you, well, it could be Cavari[ph], they used to call it. But we most, Genoa, I think, is a big city. -- [pp. 2] --  LEVINE: Well, you said Borzonasca. LOSSO: Borzonasca. That's the town where I came from. LEVINE: Right. And that's spelled B-O-R-Z . . .

LOSSO: Wait a minute. ( she laughs ) I was, yeah, it was in November . . . LEVINE: That's right. LOSSO: Wait a minute. Now I got all fouled up with this. 1902, November the 2nd. LEVINE: Right, okay. Okay. ( they laugh ) Now, when you think about Borzonasca. LOSSO: Yeah. LEVINE: Borzonasca, however you say it, what are the things that you remember about that town? LOSSO: We had a business over there. We had a big store. LEVINE: What did you sell? LOSSO: Oh, everything. Everything. It was a big store. It was the only big one we had in the town. Oh, we were well-known over there. And, uh, my father used to work, he was a manager in a factory. And my mother raised ten kids. No, five girls and four boys. LEVINE: Well, now, the store, your father didn't work in the store? LOSSO: No. He was out on business in a factory. He was like a manager in a big building over there. He was good at that. -- [pp. 3] --  LEVINE: And what was his name? LOSSO: Lino, Lionel, they called him. L-I-N-O. Merrusi. LEVINE: And, uh, what do you remember about your father from when you were a little girl in Italy? What do you remember him doing, and . . . LOSSO: Oh, he was a good man. LEVINE: Did he ever do things with you? Now, be careful, because you're hooked up here. ( referring to the microphone wire ) LOSSO: I know. Here's his picture. ( she laughs ) He was a nice man. He was like a manager in the factory. He was good. And she had five girls and four boys, my mother. And then, besides, she raised a, yeah, she raised another one outside. LEVINE: How did that happen that she raised . . . LOSSO: No, because the woman didn't have no milk, you know what I mean? They don't do it here, with the bottles and everything. They used to raise, help each other that way. See? LEVINE: So she nursed someone else's baby who couldn't nurse . . . LOSSO: Also, yeah, yeah. Oh, we all, you know, in the town you're all like that. You help one another. It's not small, because it's got two big churches in there, but I mean we're all known, like. It's not here. Here we only know, I don't even know who lives in here. ( she lowers her voice ) They're all Jewish people. They all moved in here because they don't have to pay nothing. All Highland Park moved in here. We're about five of us from the beginning, since it was built. It's about twenty-two years old. -- [pp. 4] --  LEVINE: Well, now, let's talk more about, uh, about your life in Italy. Did you go to school there? LOSSO: I went to a Catholic school over there. They only had that. My daughter, she's got the pictures, we take it, yeah, with the sisters and all this, the religious, you know. Very strict over there. LEVINE: And tell me about the school and about the church. LOSSO: Well, as I can remember, he had a picture taken, too. Take everything away from me. She loves to have antiques like that. We used to go in the Catholic school. We didn't have, what you call it? LEVINE: Like a public school. LOSSO: Yeah, a public school. That's only in the religion over there. Yeah, she's got my picture there. It was taken with the sisters. LEVINE: What do you remember about the sisters over there? LOSSO: Oh, they're nice girls, very strict over there. LEVINE: What would they be strict about? LOSSO: The religion more, too, because there's only one thing over there, the religion. We're all Italian, and we're all the same nationality, and everything the same. So we didn't really, they were all good. We had a good, we had a big department store over there, a big store. We used to sell everything that you can remember. LEVINE: Did you sell food? LOSSO: Everything! Clothes and material. It was like one store had everything in it. We used to pay rent over there, because these people lived in the next town. Well, that's more like, uh, would be like Highland Park. And they had business down there. They used to go back and forth. And we rented the place there. Oh, what a beautiful place it is! They got big stairs like that, all marbled. Even in a small town! Compared to here. -- [pp. 5] --  LEVINE: Now, where the marble stairs were, was that where you lived? Or where . . . LOSSO: That's where we, we lived in there. We lived on the first floor, like. We'd pay rent. They had four flights. The stairs were that big, all marble. And then we had, like, the department store. They carry everything. We left so many bills over there. We used to pay by the, by the month or by the week, you know? And all of a sudden they decided to send us, they'd come here because she had five girls and four boys, and the boys were over here, and one sister. Then they sent for my father to come over from over there, to be here with them, and then they won't let him come back. So we had to decide to sell, we came over, five of us. LEVINE: Well, now, your brothers went over first? LOSSO: Yeah. LEVINE: But did you have, like, aunts and uncles, or did you have any other family over here? LOSSO: No, only brothers. LEVINE: So your brothers were, how was it that your first brothers decided to come? Do you remember? LOSSO: Not that I know. Well, I guess they wanted to make a different way of living, probably, and things like that, because over there, in a small town, what can you do? There's not much business or anything. So they came out, the two of them came out, and we came out in five of us on the boat. I was eleven years then. LEVINE: Now, how come your father couldn't go back? -- [pp. 6] --  LOSSO: They won't let him. LEVINE: Your brothers? LOSSO: Yeah. He had four boys. But three of them was here. And they all work, and one had, like, a house, and he had a saloon business, restaurant, like that. And, uh, that's when they send my father, and he's, he was here, my mother was over there, we were five over there yet. So they decided then we all should come over. We sold everything over there, and then we came over. LEVINE: Okay. What was your mother's name? LOSSO: Louise, Louisa. LEVINE: Louisa. And what was her maiden name? Do you remember? LOSSO: Oh, I couldn't remember that now. If my daughters were here, probably. I could think of that name. LEVINE: That's all right. Whatever you, if you happen to think of it you can say it. LOSSO: Yeah. LEVINE: Okay. And did you have Grandmother and Grandfather over in Italy? No. LOSSO: No? No. LEVINE: How about aunts and uncles? LOSSO: No. We were all in the, just . . . LEVINE: Just the immediate family. LOSSO: Yeah, just the family. We didn't have nobody there. LEVINE: Now, were you closest to any particular family member? LOSSO: Over there? LEVINE: Yeah. When you were . . . LOSSO: Oh, you know how it is over there. Everybody knows each other, like here. Not like here, because here they changed. I mean, uh, you know, over there, the people, they're all like in one family. They all know each other, and you live a different life altogether. -- [pp. 7] --  LEVINE: Tell me about the church and what kind of holidays did you celebrate in the church? LOSSO: Did you see that picture I showed you? LEVINE: Yeah. LOSSO: Yeah. Oh, they're religious over there. We had two churches. That was the big one, then when we used to call the little church, and we were, like, from here to there on the town. They were up for it, and this was down here. It was a small church. It was nice over there. LEVINE: Could you describe your first Holy Communion? LOSSO: Huh? LEVINE: What was it like when you received your first Holy . . . LOSSO: What they do here, mostly it's the same thing. Oh, yeah. They were strict over there. Too bad they got all those, I never thought of asking for those pictures. I had all the pictures taken with them. I got that one up there. That's when we came over, the five of us. LEVINE: Oh, great. Now, were you, um, was that a big day for you, when you received your first Holy Communion? LOSSO: What? LEVINE: Was it a big day when you got your First . . . LOSSO: Oh, in Europe, yeah, they celebrated. LEVINE: What did you wear? Do you remember what you had on? LOSSO: Oh, yeah. I had a veil, just like here. Oh, yeah. The religion goes that way, from the pope on, there's everything, the same way. Yeah. Oh, it was nice over there. I had pictures taken there with the sisters and the whole class, because there's only religion. -- [pp. 8] --  LEVINE: How big a class was it? Was it a lot of children, or . . . LOSSO: Oh, yeah. It was about twenty-five of us in there. Oh, yeah. See, she got all those pictures. That one up there, she loves the antiques and things, like to remember. This, the other one up here, she works for my son, he's in the (?). She don't give a thing what goes on. She don't like what she does. LEVINE: It's a difference, a difference in personalities. LOSSO: Oh, she's just a, and then any little thing everywhere, she's altogether this. And you won't even think she belongs two sisters. They hardly even talk to each other. LEVINE: Okay. Now, how about what did you do when you were little? Did you help the, did you help your mother or father do certain things? LOSSO: Well, we had a store there. LEVINE: And what did you do? Did you do anything in the store? LOSSO: Well, I used to go to school. I used to go to school and then, you know, because I was young yet. Boy. LEVINE: Do you remember what you did? Did you have a girlfriend, or did you . . . LOSSO: Over there, a small town, you know, we all know each other, you know, together. Oh, that's the beauty of it, yeah. Oh, we had a lot of . . . LEVINE: What do you remember about it that makes you feel like it was a really nice place to be a girl? LOSSO: Well, compared to this, you know, a big city, country, whatever it is, it's altogether different over there. -- [pp. 9] --  LEVINE: Yeah, tell about it. LOSSO: We did different, the whole town know each other. We, like one family. I mean, we all get together, holidays or anything like that. It's all, it's altogether different, like, well, here's got a lot of denominations, you know, that you can't expect that, but over there we were like that. We knew everybody who lived in town, because it wasn't that big. LEVINE: And everybody was the same as far as being Catholic . . . LOSSO: Oh, yeah, we all respect each other. They're all nice people, really. Oh, I could get used to over there. ( she laughs ) LEVINE: Tell me about . . . LOSSO: I came over here, I had to go to school. I, yeah, I went up to the sixth grade that time. That was a graduation, like, those years here. Well, I came in New York, and I lived there ever since. I came here in 1929. I got married here. LEVINE: Can you remember the kinds of food that your mother made when you were a little girl in Italy? LOSSO: Oh, Jesus, compared to here. And I do my own, yet, like I'm used to it. I got all the utensils here. And, you know, my mother thought, she never, oh, yeah. But she used to work down in a big city and, uh, and she used to be the cook there for the priest, for the church. And one time she took me down there, I was about nine years old. And me, I wasn't used to being among those, you know, the priest and all that, you know? And I got, well, we were respected, though. We know how to be with them, they'll tell you, you know. And then when, oh, no. Then she, my mother was a very good cook. So she went to another city, it's a bigger city, Menelia[ph], they call it, and there used to be the church, and the priests where they used to live. She used to be the cook there. So she invited me down there one week. -- [pp. 10] --  LEVINE: What was it like? LOSSO: Oh, it was beautiful. Because we were never out of town, you know what I mean? We had no cars or nothing. We always lived there, and all the people. We went over there, and me, I was about nine years old. ( she laughs ) I wasn't used to being among priests and all those things, you know? Well, she had her own, she used to work there, though, she'd help out. Then one day they took me, I was nine years old, they took me to the big city because it's got the waterfront and, you know, the ocean and everything. Oh, it's beautiful. But the priests don't go among the other people. They go all away from there, and there are all rocks. Me, I was young, I never saw the ocean before in my life. They took me down there. I went down there for a week, like a vacation, you know? And they took me by the arm, they took me there. Oh, I was afraid to see all that water, we never saw it. He took me by the arm over here, and he dunked me up and down to get used to the water. LEVINE: Oh! LOSSO: But they were nice, though. They, they're more strict than they are here, though. You know, they respect you. Well, I stayed there about a week, like a vacation, you know, something like that. And I used to like it because it was a big city. We used to go here and there. She used to cook, and then my mother was a good cook. LEVINE: What kind of meals did she make? Can you remember anything that she cooked when you were little? -- [pp. 11] --  LOSSO: I make it here, the same thing. I got all the, you know what my mother thought of it when she left Europe? She thought she was going to the end of the world. She brought five mattress. I got one in there. A wool. She brought everything, we had the store there, too. But we left so much money there. They used to pay by the week, or the month, you know? We didn't care. We had to come, and we just lived in this beautiful building. It was, the stairs were that big, all marble stairways. They had balconies, they had, too. But these people, they were well-known. They just had business in the city. Camarin[ph], they used to call it, see? And they used to go back and forth, you know. They used to rent where we lived. There was a beautiful. And, uh, what else can I tell you? LEVINE: Well, tell me what your mother cooked? LOSSO: Oh, God, I can remember everything. She could cook anything. But this, then they're here. Here they got more seasoning, more, I still do my own cooking my own way. LEVINE: Can you tell me something you cook that you learned in Italy? LOSSO: Well, we make ravioli. You know about that? LEVINE: Uh-huh. LOSSO: I got the rolling pin here yet. LEVINE: You mean you make it from scratch? LOSSO: Oh, yeah! Like the dough. I see sometime on Sunday there there's a lot of Italian people, but they make, they got everything extra that they need. We used to make it with what we had, see? She had, my second brother, he opened a place up in Woodcliff Lake. Oh, it was a beautiful, it took the whole square block, and it had columns like this. It was a, what you call that, like rich people, millionaires. He had the whole square block. Gates that high, you know? He used to go up there on Saturday and Sunday, you know, to pass the weekend, because we always work, and, uh, she has a grand opening, my brother, the people that they know you. And she made these ravioli. -- [pp. 12] --  LEVINE: Do you remember how she made them? LOSSO: Oh, sure. I got the rolling pin in there, all cut out, the way they stamped them and the way they make them. I made them for my daughter, what was it, a couple of weeks ago, somebody's birthday or something. LEVINE: Could you describe how you make them? LOSSO: What you put in? LEVINE: Yeah. LOSSO: Oh, um, now, wait a minute. Well, it's like, Bessie here, there's an Italian woman, she cooks the same way we do. On Sunday that's all it is, cooks. The flour, and eggs, a little salt, you know, we make the dough. Then, you know, you make, softened it, you work it and make it nice and smooth. Then when it's about that big you put flour on the board. My daughter's got the board. And, uh, and you make, not long ago I made it, but I can't do it no more, because I can't stand so much on my feet. And my, uh, her son helped me out, because I get a backache when I work, and as much as I try to do it, I can't do it. And, uh, oh, yeah, well, it's regular dough. It's not anything special that you make a pie or something, eggs and, you know, and things like that. And then we roll it out. We got the long rolling pin, it's about that big, the straight one. Then we make the dough and make it big. Wait till I show you the other one! Then we make the filling. LEVINE: What do you make for the filling? LOSSO: Oh, Jesus. What the hell do you put in there? Spinach, eggs, cheese, and sausage. Yeah. And meat, beef we put in. We cook all that stuff, you know? And then when it's cooked, we make the dough first, we make a big one, and we divide it in half, just turn it. Then we spread it all over, you know? And this piece, you put it over, and you put the rolling pin. Oh, well, you put the filling in it. Then we put it over, then you go over. I'll show it to you before you go. They go with this rolling pin in squares, it makes the squares, with the filling popping up. And there's a line there where the rolling pin goes, you know? And then they puffed it. It's got, made purposely for that. And then you roll it with a cutter, you know. And they cut it all like this. Oh, she made it for me open, I don't know how many she made. She got sick up there. We got a big, it was up on the hill, like, and they had the Woodcliff Lake. They got the lake in the front there, and these people was a millionaire that had it. They had all the homes for the waiters and the people that worked there. Then he had another little house in the front. Too bad I never took those pictures. I knew I had them someplace. And, oh, it was, it had big columns like that in the front. Oh, it was a beautiful place. He was a millionaire. And on the side there they had all houses, little houses, for the people that worked there. -- [pp. 13] --  LEVINE: I see. Before we talk about this country, is there anything else about Italy that you remember, when you think back to that time, and . . . LOSSO: Well, see, we never were now, really, to go out in different cities and different, I was small then. My father worked, and then we had the store there, and, uh . . . LEVINE: Remember other things that your mother packed when she was coming here? LOSSO: Oh, she thought she was coming to the end of the, she thought she was coming to the end of the world. I never saw, I got a mattress in there. It's all wool. I had it remade. It came, it was about that high. She brought five. She thought she was coming to the end of the world. Oh, my God! All the stuff that she brought over, all the utensils and everything. We had a store there, too, but most of it we left there, the money, you know, they used to pay by the month there, you know, write it out? And, uh, oh, she brought so much. I don't know what she thought. I got all of her stuff here. LEVINE: Oh. LOSSO: That she used to use, and then some of them, my daughter has it up there, because I had them in the house and I saw, I came, I couldn't bring everything in here, so she's got half of my stuff up there. ( she laughs ) All copper. LEVINE: Copper pots? LOSSO: Oh, over there is everything copper. Yeah. Oh, she, she used to be a good cook. So she had it, and my brother had the grand opening. -- [pp. 14] --  LEVINE: Well, uh, tell me, then, when you were leaving, do you remember saying goodbye to people in the town? LOSSO: Oh, yeah. We left all the money over there. They had, you know, pay by the month . . . LEVINE: People owed you from the store. LOSSO: What were we missing, though? Because we were never out. We were brought up in there, and that's where you lived, like. It was like Highland Park, the same thing. You're used to it, and that's it. LEVINE: You remember traveling to Genoa, when you left your little town? LOSSO: Yeah, in there, a carriage, then, with the horses to ride. In those days we had no automobiles. Yeah. We went there. LEVINE: And did you stay . . . LOSSO: And I got scared because I never saw, I never saw the water, the ocean, and then, uh, the ship besides, oh, Jesus, what a ship we had. LEVINE: Tell me about the ship. LOSSO: You know, they had sections, like they would have here, first, and then there's four in the cabin. That goes like this, back and forth. The ocean was so rough! And we had the trunks under there, came in through the window, the round window there. Oh, Jesus. Oh! LEVINE: So you were in a cabin? LOSSO: Yeah. Oh, they had their own, you know. You buy whatever, yeah, we're on the second class. LEVINE: Oh, you were . . . LOSSO: The first class is rich people, like here. They got everything modern, you know? But we came over, it was on the second class. We were five of us. -- [pp. 15] --  LEVINE: Do you remember if there was a steerage on your ship? Were the people in the bottom, like, living in like a dormitory? LOSSO: Yeah, there are two, three floors there. Oh, yeah. It was pretty big at that time, that ship. Not like they made them lately. Yeah. Oh, we were, we had, the water came in and out, was going like that. The following week it sank, that ship. LEVINE: Really! LOSSO: We came here on St. Patrick's Day. LEVINE: That's when you arrived. Do you remember coming into the New York Harbor? LOSSO: Oh, yeah. Now my daughter's telling me she brings stuff down there on display and all that, and, you know, she doesn't realize. She goes for things like that. My other daughter's not interested in those things. She doesn't, but her, she loves it. LEVINE: So when you first came into the Harbor, did you see the Statue of Liberty? LOSSO: Oh, yeah. Oh . . . LEVINE: Did you know what it was? LOSSO: Well, not those days, because I don't even remember if we were taught in school, because it was a religious, you know, everything more likely that way, too. And, uh . . . LEVINE: And did you have to, do you remember going to Ellis Island? LOSSO: Oh, and we docked here, sure. This is the one I got. LEVINE: Well, that's when you became a citizen. LOSSO: Yeah. LEVINE: But before that, when you first came over, do you remember like, um . . . -- [pp. 16] --  LOSSO: Oh, Jesus, it was like a stable over here. It was all little, like a room. Everybody went one room or the other. Oh, my God, the way we came in, when we saw that, we were like animals. Put us up in those. ( she laughs ) LEVINE: Now, it was you and your mother and one brother . . . LOSSO: No, yeah, the youngest one, my older sister. There's a picture up here. LEVINE: Oh, okay. LOSSO: And, uh, we were five of us coming over. Yeah. Wait a minute, my youngest brother, me, and two sisters, and my mother, yeah, we were five of us. LEVINE: Uh-huh. And, uh, do you remember if there was any problem at Ellis Island? Was there any problem with anybody being sick, or . . . LOSSO: No, no, we did. Oh, we came in there like animals at that time. All little . . . ( she laughs ) Little boxes to put separate people, all those people coming in, you know, at that day. LEVINE: Did you have to stay overnight at Ellis Island? LOSSO: No. Then my brothers got me. They came. They took us, and he had a home, and we went in there at the beginning. LEVINE: Do you remember being examined at Ellis Island? LOSSO: Oh, yeah. They make you through. LEVINE: Your hair, looking at your eyes? LOSSO: No, they don't go for that. They just, where you come from and things like that, more. They don't . . . LEVINE: Questions. -- [pp. 17] --  LOSSO: Yeah. They don't, as far as I remember anyways. LEVINE: What was it like when you went there? Was it crowded? LOSSO: Oh, the whole boat. Oh, my God, there's three, three flights in there, in the boat. So many people. We were like, to me it looked like animals, like a bathroom. All boxes, like that, we called them boxes. Ellis Island, those days. And now she tells me she bought things, this and that. ""Gee,"" I says, ""I would love to see the difference it is now."" What they remodeled it again now. Oh, God. Everything was new to us, because we were never out of the town, you know? And everything seemed so, my brother, not the young, the youngest one was with us and, uh, the second one. Oh, he was crazy after me. He had a house, and he had a saloon in New York. LEVINE: Where in New York? Do you remember? LOSSO: In 26th Street, between Eighth and Ninth. LEVINE: Between Eighth and Ninth, on the west side. Uh-huh. LOSSO: He had a saloon, and he had a big room in the back. He used to make a restaurant out of it. And he had a house with two floors, so we lived in one of them. The other one was rent, oh, no, my sister, yeah, was there. We were five girls and four boys, my mother. LEVINE: Do you remember, who picked you up at Ellis Island? LOSSO: My brother. LEVINE: Which one was that? LOSSO: He was a second one. The older one, he had four children, he couldn't make it, but he took it. Oh, he was crazy after me. When he saw me, oh, boy, in New York he took me all over to see this and see that, you know? Oh, he was crazy. -- [pp. 18] --  LEVINE: And what struck you in particular when you saw this new city? LOSSO: Well, we weren't used to those things, and everything seemed so, it's a big city anyway, New York, no question about it. And everything, oh, God, I couldn believe it either. Oh, well, I was about eleven years old. I mean, you know. I have a picture there. Yeah. Then we, uh, we used to live in that house, and he used to own it, and my other sister used to live upstairs. We stayed there for a long time. And, uh . . . LEVINE: What was it like seeing your father again after all that time? LOSSO: Oh, yeah. Well, that's why. They didn't want to send him back to us. So they decided, all together, that we should come over here, because they liked it here, sure, better than over there. But it was sad over there. We knew all these people. The whole town know each other. And then you got to leave, you know. It was, and we didn't know where the hell we were going. ( she laughs ) To come in this country too, you know, all the things, we're going to go with a boat, the following week it went down. It sunk, that boat. Oh, dear. There were, it was all right. Me, I was young yet. I got the picture up there. I was sitting on my mother's lap. I was a baby. Oh, that was years before. But, uh . . . LEVINE: So did you go to school when you stayed with your brother on 26th Street? LOSSO: Oh, sure. Then we got our own apartment after. -- [pp. 19] --  LEVINE: Right in that neighborhood? LOSSO: Yeah. We went to Chelsea School. LEVINE: And what was that like? LOSSO: Wait a minute. Ninth, Eighth or Ninth Avenue. It's a big school, it was. And I went up to the sixth grade there. END OF SIDE ONE BEGINNING OF SIDE TWO LEVINE: What was it like learning English when you first went to school? LOSSO: Oh, that was tough. ( she laughs ) That was really, but they got a lot of patience, a lot of, like it would be like today. They try to learn different languages and all that, you know? It takes time, you know. But I, and it wasn't far from there either. The school was on 28th Street. I went up to sixth grade there. LEVINE: Did the children tease you at first when you first came over? LOSSO: No, over there they're different. No, even here they were, they weren't like, oh, God, I said, Jesus, what is she today? I says, my kids, even when I was up here that I bought a house, they used to go from one block to the other, on that same block. They never moved out of that place there. They go here, what they do, I can't stand it. Did you look on TV, the way they get dressed and all this? Oh, Jesus. LEVINE: So were your teachers nice to you? LOSSO: Huh? LEVINE: Were your teachers nice? LOSSO: Oh, we were in Catholic school. LEVINE: Oh, you went to Catholic school in Chelsea? -- [pp. 20] --  LOSSO: Oh, yeah. Oh, not here. Oh, no. Over there. LEVINE: Over there. Uh-huh. LOSSO: No, over here, it's still there, that school. It's on Ninth Avenue and 29th Street. It's still there, that school. No, I went to public school there, yeah. And finished the sixth grade. Yeah. LEVINE: And then what did you do after you finished? LOSSO: Then we worked. LEVINE: Where did you work? LOSSO: I used to work for Lord & Taylor. LEVINE: Were you selling things in the store? LOSSO: No. I sew. I even sew today. Everybody in the building come here, do this and do that for me. The heck with these people. You learn something, but here they're different. They don't teach those things. Even in school, they don't. I don't know. LEVINE: What did you, what did you sew for Lord & Taylor? LOSSO: Well, I used to go in the factory, and come home for lunch. They used to make the Eighth Avenue subway, up and down the stairs there, the wooden stairs that you have to, we used to walk all the time, back and forth for lunch, four times a day. So first I used to work in the skirts, the Jewish people and, uh, well, I was there quite a while. Everything by hand. They used to charge snaps, one penny. We used to hand in . . . LEVINE: You got one penny when you put on a snap? LOSSO: That's what they paid you. I used to hand my env-, there, never open the envelope. They give you the little envelope, whatever you make, you had it in. If they give you something, all right. If you don't, that's it. Of course, they pay board, you . . . -- [pp. 21] --  LEVINE: You mean, you gave the envelope . . . LOSSO: To my mother. LEVINE: To your mother. LOSSO: Yeah. You know, they had to live, too, and they use it a different way. When we were, well, I was working. Then the four girls, five girls, we had a, we rented a place, it was a doctor's place. It was a beautiful house. And we lived on the first floor, and they had eight rooms in there. We had a big dining room there, my God. She . . . LEVINE: Where was that? LOSSO: In New York. LEVINE: In Manhattan? In the west side, by, uh . . . LOSSO: 26th Street. LEVINE: Uh-huh. LOSSO: So we . . . ( she laughs ) See what they do those days? We had a big, uh, apartment, and we were all four boys, and all the girls and one boy there at that time. And we needed all the rooms we could get. And, uh, it was a doctor's place there. I used to babysit for them. He was a nice Irish guy. And we used to live in their house and pay rent. I don't even remember how much we paid. It was easy to take care, though. It was eight rooms. And what we used to do, when we used to work, my, we had a big dining room table. See, they don't do like that they do today. All the boys sat over there, the girls went out with, and we sat on this side. And you used to talk and work at the same time. We didn't waste no time. We did our work. LEVINE: You mean, you did the homework, what they call home work? -- [pp. 22] --  LOSSO: No, crocheting or whatever you had to do by hand. LEVINE: You mean for the family? LOSSO: No, no. LEVINE: For yourself. LOSSO: Yeah, yeah. I mean for us, like. You'd be surprised all the stuff I got here yet that we made from over there. LEVINE: Well, how did you learn how to sew and how to crochet? LOSSO: Oh, over there that's the main thing in Europe. That's the first thing the kids learn when they get older, old enough to hold a needle. Oh, they teach them early. No, I gave there in the saloon. LEVINE: Well, who taught you? Who taught you how? LOSSO: Oh, well, my sisters were older than me, you know. And we used to work, the three sisters used to go. One of them had to go in a different section, and you used to work for Jewish people, way up in those big buildings. And, uh, we used to come home for lunch, go back, four times a day. We never eat outside. We used to go out, lunch hour, go in the Woolworth in the big stores, just to ge"
Teresa Cardinale Constantine;Italy;"LEVINE: Okay. This is Janet Levine for the National Park Service. And today is July 7th, 1993. And I'm here in the Ellis Island recording studio with Teresa Cardinale Constantine. Mrs. Constantine came to the United States from Italy in 1917 when she was eight years old. Well, I'm very happy to meet you, and I'm looking forward to hearing your story about coming to this country.  CONSTANTINE: It was nice meeting you, too. It's a very, privilege for me to be here.  LEVINE: Wonderful. Okay, well, let's proceed by starting at the beginning. Tell me your birth date and the town you were born in.  CONSTANTINE: March 9th, 1908. And I was born in a little town in Italy named Casono del Murge.  LEVINE: How do spell that?  CONSTANTINE: It's C-A-S-O-N-O. Del Murge is D-E-L, M-U-R-G-E.  LEVINE: And where is that located, Casono del Murge?  CONSTANTINE: It's located mostly on the west coast of Italy. And the providence [sic] is Bari. B-A-R-I.  -- [pp. 2] --  LEVINE: Now did you live in Casono the entire time, your eight years before you came to the United States?  CONSTANTINE: Yeah. Yes. Yes.  LEVINE: Okay. What kind of a place was that? What, was it a big town, a village?  CONSTANTINE: No, it was mostly a village. And not too big. And we had our home there. But, of course, it's not like here in the United States, you own a home and it's yours. Each floor is owned by a different person.  LEVINE: Oh. Tell me about the house, whatever you remember about the house you lived in there.  CONSTANTINE: Well, what I remember, it looked something like in the 1800 of, in this country. It was very plain, different rooms that's just separated by curtains. No doors.  LEVINE: What was it made out of?  CONSTANTINE: Stone. Stone homes. That's what they are all made out of stone. Inside it's mostly tile. Not wooden floors. And it, we had it pretty easy, because we were in the town. The farm people had it much harder.  LEVINE: Did you have, do you remember what your mother cooked on?  CONSTANTINE: Oh, gee, I really can't remember. But what I, what I do remember, to keep warm there was a little fireplace. It's made out of wood round, and in the center of the, of the fire would be like a copper lining. And in there we used to warm up with the, with the almond shells. We used to light almond shells for fire. And this border around, it would be to put your feet on. You kept warm. (she laughs) Really, really, no bathrooms.  -- [pp. 3] --  LEVINE: How did you get water?  CONSTANTINE: We, we had a well into our own building, and we didn't have it that bad. But there was people, there was a town, you go to the town and they have, well, in many places they had water pipes that people could go in there and fill it up, you know. But we had a well. And my mother also was in business. We had like a country store. A little bit of everything, you know. And we had a nice living. Not expensive living, but nice living. We never went hungry.  LEVINE: What was your mother's name?  CONSTANTINE: My mother's name was Victoria.  LEVINE: Do you remember her maiden name?  CONSTANTINE: Yes.  LEVINE: What was that?  CONSTANTINE: Salvaggi. S-A-L-V-A-G-G-I.  LEVINE: And, so your mother ran a little store.  CONSTANTINE: Yes. Yes.  LEVINE: What do you remember about the store?  CONSTANTINE: Well, it, that was, we ran the store from our own house. And she was a baker. She used to bake bread. And she was known in the town as ""Victoria the Baker."" But we used to sell a little bit of everything in there. But my father had passed away and, when I was four years old. And my mother really was a man and the mother of the house.  LEVINE: Well, now, so you don't remember your father?  CONSTANTINE: I think I remember him because my mother talked so much about him. But really I have no recognition [sic]. And we have a picture that, you know, that I have now. My brother had it. He's the only one that had a picture of my, of my father. But since he passed away they gave it to me, which I was very happy.  -- [pp. 4] --  LEVINE: Well, now, you lived in, the house you lived in, there were different people living on each floor?  CONSTANTINE: Each floor, yes.  LEVINE: So that you and your mother and your brother were on the first floor...  CONSTANTINE: Yes.  LEVINE: The ground floor?  CONSTANTINE: Ground floor.  LEVINE: Which is where she sold things out of?  CONSTANTINE: Yes. Yes.  LEVINE: Do you remember any experiences in the store, any things that happened...  CONSTANTINE: Well, this is what happened, you know. My mother used to bake bread. And she'd make my brother and I get up and help her. Maybe we gave her more trouble, because we had to weigh the dough. And one time I forget to put an ounce on it. And after the bread was all made, my mother had to take it all apart and do it all over again. So I don't think we were too much help. (she laughs)  LEVINE: Well, did you say you forgot to put an ounce on it?  CONSTANTINE: We had to weigh the, the dough.  LEVINE: Uh-huh.  CONSTANTINE: And I forgot to put, say, it was a pound, and it needed another ounce. I forgot to the weight on it to weigh the bread. And after it was all finished my mother had to break it all apart and start all over again. That's the only thing I really remember of doing it, you know.  LEVINE: Yeah. What was your brother's name?  -- [pp. 5] --  CONSTANTINE: Joseph.  LEVINE: Joseph. And how about your father? What was his name?  CONSTANTINE: Thomas.  LEVINE: Thomas. Okay. And so you and your brother and your mother were the only one's living in your home there?  CONSTANTINE: Yes. Yes.  LEVINE: Did you have grandparents?  CONSTANTINE: I had grandparents, but they lived in their own home.  LEVINE: In the same town?  CONSTANTINE: Same town.  LEVINE: Do you remember any experiences with your grandparents?  CONSTANTINE: Well, the only thing I remembered is when we came to America, they came to, they came with us to the boat. And we waved good-bye. They were old at the time. They were eighty-six and eighty-five. And six months later my grandmother passed away, in six months that we were in America. And she passed away. And six months later after that my grandfather passed away, so we never seen them. Oh, I wish I would have taken that picture with me today. I would have showed you.  LEVINE: Oh.  CONSTANTINE: We had a picture with my mother, my brother and I, and my sister and my mother's grandparents. We had taken it to send to America. My father had been here, and he was here for two years. Then he came back to Italy, and my mother wouldn't let him come back, because they used to say, you're lucky he came home, because a lot of them go away, they never come back home. So my mother wouldn't let him, he was supposed to come, but she wouldn't let him come, so he passed away there.  -- [pp. 6] --  LEVINE: I see. Well, now your father, when he left for the United States, was that about 1915?  CONSTANTINE: Oh, no. I don't think...  LEVINE: No, it had to be before that.  CONSTANTINE: I don't think I was born.  LEVINE: Oh, okay.  CONSTANTINE: Yeah. But I was two years old when we took this picture to send to my father.  LEVINE: I see.  CONSTANTINE: Yeah. So, I don't think, you know, he came back. I was the fifth child. They had six children. But three died and three lived. Maybe...  LEVINE: Now, who, what was your sister's name, the one who lived?  CONSTANTINE: Marian.  LEVINE: And how old was she? You were, now wait a minute. She, did she come to America at the same time you did?  CONSTANTINE: No.  LEVINE: No. She came before that?  CONSTANTINE: Yes. She came six months before with some friends in the, hometown people that were leaving also. And my mother, you know, she asked them to watch over here. She was eighteen.  LEVINE: Uh-huh.  CONSTANTINE: See, she was the first child. I'm the fifth. And that, there was ten years difference between her and I. So she came here six months before.  LEVINE: I see. Now, what, why was the decision made for her to come? Do you remember why she went first?  CONSTANTINE: Well, I think that, I really don't know the reason, you know. My mother never really talked about it. But she had a brother here. And she wanted her to, to go to the new world and see how it was and how she liked it. And with my uncle everything worked out fine. And she got a job right away. And she worked, she saved money on that ten dollars a week. And before we came, she had her home, she had rented a house, and she had needs. What we needed to, to stay there. Beds, a chair, table and chairs, and where we sleep a little bureau. Only the necessities that was important for us to start our lifetime, you know.  -- [pp. 7] --  LEVINE: What was she working at when she was here?  CONSTANTINE: When she came here she got a job in the chocolate factory. Candy factory.  LEVINE: Uh-huh. Where was that?  CONSTANTINE: In New York. But we lived in Brooklyn.  LEVINE: Okay. So, did you go to school in Italy at all?  CONSTANTINE: Yes, I did. I was promoted to the second grade.  LEVINE: Uh-huh.  CONSTANTINE: I finished second grade, and I was promoted to the third, but I didn't, I didn't use that at all. And at the time I was doing very well with the speaking and, and writing. Now I don't know too much. I forgot all about it. (she laughs)  LEVINE: Well, now you know English.  CONSTANTINE: Yes, I do. Yes.  LEVINE: So, so, what do you remember about school? What do you remember...  CONSTANTINE: In school?  LEVINE: ...of your experiences there?  CONSTANTINE: In Italy?  LEVINE: Yeah.  CONSTANTINE: I really don't have too much recollection of it. I think we were taught by the nuns. We used to go to the convent and be taught by the nuns. I don't have, I, I can't recall that period of my school days.  LEVINE: How about your brother? Was he in the same school?  CONSTANTINE: He was in the same school. He had finished third grade. And he had promoted to the fourth grade. And in, that is a very good grade in Italy, you know, because they have one year for each class. And really I should know how to speak and write well. But I don't. I forgot all about it. I picked up my new language. I forgot all about the old, you know?  -- [pp. 8] --  LEVINE: Uh-huh. Well, who were you closest too in the family?  CONSTANTINE: My, my original family?  LEVINE: Yeah.  CONSTANTINE: I was very close to my brother.  LEVINE: What was he like, Joseph?  CONSTANTINE: He was a wonderful person. Very warm. Very loving. And he, he was the father of our home. When I was young he was my father. And if I wanted to go out and he said no, he was strict. I couldn't go out. (they laugh) But he was easier going with his children. But he was wonderful to me.  LEVINE: Yeah. Well, let's see. How about community life? What did people do in Casono for fun?  CONSTANTINE: Oh, I don't know. I don't think I ever seen, you know. Just getting together. That was the main thing. Just getting together. Sometime picnics out to the country. Because we were in the town, so we went to the country. That was a big thing, you know. And what I remember there so well, is that you exchanged, my mother had, say, the bread and the spaghettis and the cheese. And the farmer had the vegetables and the meat had the meat. You exchanged. Most of the times it would even up the money. And there was many times people owed my mother money. And this is what I remember so well, because my mother made me do it. She sent my sister, when she was older, never came back with any money. But she sent me, and I talked them to death. (they laugh) And they paid. And my mother says, ""I know who to send now."" I could have been no more that five, six years old at the time, you know. But I had, I had a gift of gab. Especially making people laugh, you know.  -- [pp. 9] --  LEVINE: Wonderful.  CONSTANTINE: Yeah.  LEVINE: Well, now, what did you, what people do for work in that town, do you remember?  CONSTANTINE: Most of them were stone makers. Builders. House builders. That I know of, you know. And, of course, there was, there was banks. There was a bank that, we had a dear friend, he baptized my brother. He was more wealthy person. And he worked in the bank. And most of them, men especially, were, were cement workers. Stone workers that they build the houses with, that I could recall.  LEVINE: And how about the agriculture?  CONSTANTINE: Well, there was a lot of farm. There was a lot of farm. And the town was known for almond trees. A lot of almond trees. That's why we were able to burn the almond. (she laughs)  LEVINE: Yeah.  CONSTANTINE: That was our fire, you know. That was the, like we have coal here and things. We had the almond shells.  LEVINE: Let's see. So do you remember any dishes that your mother made that you particularly liked as a little girl?  CONSTANTINE: Oh, mostly spaghettis. You know, pasta. Mostly pasta. They were...  LEVINE: What did you put on it? Do you remember?  CONSTANTINE: Oh, we had cheese and gra, sauce just like you use, like we have it here. The only thing once in a while she would make polenta, and we didn't like it no matter what she put on it. It's like wheatina, you know. It's supposed to be a delicacy, but we didn't care for it. But we had meats, and we had pasta, and we had vegetables. As I said, they exchanged. The money exchange with, with the products that they gave, you know, with each other. And then, you know, that was the way of life that I remember.  -- [pp. 10] --  LEVINE: Yeah. Do you remember the religious life. Do you remember any...  CONSTANTINE: (she coughs) Very.  LEVINE: ...religious occasions?  CONSTANTINE: Very. Very, very much the Catholic religion. At that time mostly all Italians were. But not today. They're all mixed. But they were all very strict Catholics.  LEVINE: Do you remember any either religious celebrations or any...  CONSTANTINE: Well, we had, like, once a year we had a feast in our home town. The patron saint, they would take her out every year. You see how they do in New York, on Mulberry Street, they bring out the statue, and they bring her all around the town, and this is what was mostly that I remember, that it was celebration, a big celebration with the patron saint of the town.  LEVINE: And what would you do? What would people do during that celebration?  CONSTANTINE: Well, they would, they would have music. And they would, you know, dance around, get together, eat, you know. And, nothing too extravagant. (she laughs) The town wasn't that big enough to, it was just simple. Simple.  LEVINE: Do you remember games that you played as a little girl?  CONSTANTINE: You know, this is the funniest thing. I don't remember being little. I don't know why, I don't remember my young youth. I think we had to grow up very early, because of my father dying so young. And we had to help out. I don't even remember my young days in America. And I was quite a big girl, eight years old. I should. And I don't remember my young days. We had to, there was no playing. No games. The most fun we had was going on picnics and getting together with friends. That was the big thing. The only thing I remember in Italy during the war time, my mother to raise money, we were selling fruit. We had a camp of, near our home town that the soldiers. And they used to come to buy candles and fruit and whatever we were selling. And I would help my mother by weighing the grapes. You had to weigh it, you know, by the pound, not by the pound. (she laughs) And I would, if the scale didn't go this way it went, I would take the one off. (she gestures) Even if, now that was, and the soldiers were laughing, because of such a small girl like me, trying to save everyone of those, of those grapes, you know. (she laughs) But's that's the only thing I really remember when I was there in Italy.  -- [pp. 11] --  LEVINE: So in other words, your mother would, would get fruits and vegetables from the farmers...  CONSTANTINE: Yes.  LEVINE: ...and sell them in the little store that she had?  CONSTANTINE: Yes. Yeah. And this was to raise money during the war time, because we were saving the money for the trip. We were not the wealthy people. We were on average mostly down instead of up. (she laughs) We didn't have wealth. No.  LEVINE: Do you remember anything about the war?  CONSTANTINE: Well, all I remember that there was this camp in the town, and the soldiers used to come to the town. And on the trip, when we came, when we were on the trip to America, like our boat, they said it was practice, but it was being shot at. We all had to wear jack...  LEVINE: Life jackets?  CONSTANTINE: Life jackets. And we were in danger, and everybody prayed, you know. That's the only thing I remember about the war.  LEVINE: Okay. Now, so your sister came, went six months before you and your mother and your brother?  CONSTANTINE: Yes.  LEVINE: And she was received by your mother's...  CONSTANTINE: Brother.  LEVINE: ...brother. And she then, did she send money back?  CONSTANTINE: No, no.  LEVINE: No. She...  CONSTANTINE: She just saved.  LEVINE: ...just made ready for you...  CONSTANTINE: Yes.  -- [pp. 12] --  LEVINE: ...to come.  CONSTANTINE: Yes.  LEVINE: So then your mother made the money...  CONSTANTINE: Yes.  LEVINE: ...for your passage?  CONSTANTINE: Oh, yes. Yeah.  LEVINE: And, do you remember leaving the town?  CONSTANTINE: Yes, I remember.  LEVINE: What was that like?  CONSTANTINE: It was sad leaving the town. And very, very sad leaving the grandparents. We knew we'd never see them again. They were on in age already. At the time they were already in, in 1917 he was eighty-six and my grandma was eighty-five. And we knew we'd never see them again.  LEVINE: Do you remember anything that either your grandmother or your grandfather told you?  CONSTANTINE: No.  LEVINE: Any kind of...  CONSTANTINE: Story.  LEVINE: ...stories or lessons or their ideas of life or anything?  CONSTANTINE: Well, their ideas of life were very simple. They were already too old, you know, for, for me. And as I said, I don't remember being, we were close to them, but we, you know, we saw them every day, but never sitting down and saying stories or anything to you about anything, you know.  LEVINE: What would they be doing, like when you would see them? What, what, activities? Did they...  CONSTANTINE: No.  LEVINE: ...do things. They were...  CONSTANTINE: No. Just visit.  -- [pp. 13] --  LEVINE: ...they were older. So they were sitting...  CONSTANTINE: Yeah.  LEVINE: ...and you would come in and...  CONSTANTINE: Yes. Yeah.  LEVINE: Uh-huh.  CONSTANTINE: They were, we were just visiting, you know, to see Grandma and Grandpa. And maybe share some food, you know, bring them something that my mother would make, and bring them something. But no games and no, you know.  LEVINE: Okay. So, do you remember anything your mother packed to take with you when you went?  CONSTANTINE: Oh, just the necessities. The, mostly necessities, clothes. That's about all. We didn't carry too much.  LEVINE: Do you remember your clothes? Do you remember like what you were wearing when you went to the ship?  CONSTANTINE: Well, it was a plain cotton dress, you know. I remember a blue ribbon on, on, for a belt. And the first day that we were on the ship, all the children we so happy. We played ring around the rosy, you know, all together. But that was the last day we saw each other, because after that we were all sick. We all got sick, you know, and we didn't see each other. We were, didn't play too much. (she laughs)  LEVINE: What was the name of the ship?  CONSTANTINE: The name was ship, it was Dante Alleghieri. And, you want to spell, me to spell it?  LEVINE: No, that one I've heard. We get, we get that...  CONSTANTINE: Dante Alleghieri. It, it was nice at the time.  -- [pp. 14] --  LEVINE: Do you remember your accommodations on the ship?  CONSTANTINE: The accommodations, it was like we were all in one room. The women and girls were in one room, and the men were separated from there, from their wives. They were all in another room with the boys. And the accommodations were like, the beds were like hammocks, because this is third class. Not, no, not way down in the boat. We didn't have beds and we didn't have a lot of any luxury at all. But we made it. That's the main thing. (she laughs) We made it.  LEVINE: Do you remember the food?  CONSTANTINE: The food was terrible. The smell of the coffee was awful. My mother often bought the second class food, because it was, you know, it was done up a little bit better. We, we didn't eat too much because we were very seasick.  LEVINE: So in other words your mother would what, go to the dining room for the second class?  CONSTANTINE: No, she would ask someone, attendants of the third class, and they would bring it down. No, we, we couldn't, no, you didn't go to the dining room. It was just attendants, you say, could we have, you know, some things from the second class. And that was much better, you know, than they were giving us.  LEVINE: Yeah. Uh-huh. So, is there anything else about the voyage that you remember that we haven't said?  CONSTANTINE: Well, the voyage, it was quite rough. And as I said, the boat was shipped out, was shot at. And we all had to wear these life jackets because we were in danger. But thank God we made it through, which whatever they did we made it through. Everybody prayed. And the only thing I remember on the boat is that the people, they were so close you think everyone was family. They all loved one another. And they all stayed together. As a child I could remember this, you know.  -- [pp. 15] --  LEVINE: You mean the feeling of the...  CONSTANTINE: The feeling...  LEVINE: ...of the people...  CONSTANTINE: ...of the people...  LEVINE: ...as they were crossing?  CONSTANTINE: Yes. Yes. Very, very close. Everyone was your sister. Everyone was a member of your family.  LEVINE: So the, the adults were looking out for the children and...  CONSTANTINE: Yes.  LEVINE: Uh-huh. Did they have any music or dancing on the ship?  CONSTANTINE: No. Not when I came. (she laughs)  LEVINE: Yeah. Okay. So then, do you remember the ship coming into the New York Harbor?  CONSTANTINE: Yes I do. When it came in the first thing we saw was the Statue of Liberty. And when we say that beautiful lady we knew we had come to America. (she laughs) Yes. That I remember so well.  LEVINE: Do you remember what people were doing when, when...  CONSTANTINE: Cheering, and, and screaming, and everybody was so happy that they have made it. Now we don't know if we would have landed here. (she laughs) When we got to Ellis Island, now that was another thing.  LEVINE: Well, how about the New York skyline. Do you remember seeing that for the first time?  CONSTANTINE: Well, there wasn't these tall buildings. There was none of these tall buildings when I, when we came. Now, you know, these, it came after we got here. It was just simple. No high buildings.  -- [pp. 16] --  LEVINE: What do you remember that you had heard about Ellis Island before you actually got off the boat and came here? Do you remember what people thought about it?  CONSTANTINE: At Ellis Island, there wasn't...  LEVINE: No. Before, before, you actually, like what did you hear on the boat, or what did people expect?  CONSTANTINE: Nobody mentioned it. Nobody mentioned it about Ellis Island. Everybody looked forward for the Statue of Liberty.  LEVINE: Oh.  CONSTANTINE: Yeah. There was no talk about it, you know. About when we got here and what it would be like. I don't think anyone knew.  LEVINE: I see. Okay. Why don't we pause here, and we'll turn the tape over, and then we'll continue with what you remember about Ellis Island.  CONSTANTINE: Okay.  LEVINE: Great.  END OF SIDE ONE  BEGINNING OF SIDE TWO  LEVINE: Okay. This is Side B now, and we're just about, I'm talking with Teresa Cardinale Constantine. And we're about to hear what Ellis Island was like to an eight year old when you first arrived in this country.  CONSTANTINE: When we first arrived, we had to go through an inspection. And my, there was my cousin that came to America with us. It was my mother's sister's daughter. And she was asked a question. It, it was, my, my cousin that was asked a question by the, the inspector, says, ""How many feathers has a chicken?"" And so she says, ""Well, you count them and let me know."" So she passed. Now it's my brother's turn. And there was a man in front of him, and they asked him, half Italian, half in English, ""Sei e sette, sei e sette."" The man said, ""Twelve."" He thought he said six and six. He didn't pass. My brother answered thirteen. He passed. Now it came to me. And I had these fever sores on my mouth and my head from an infection of my vaccination. And I got a chalk mark on my arm. And my mother didn't pass because she had to stay here with me.  -- [pp. 17] --  LEVINE: Now how, when did you have the vaccination?  CONSTANTINE: When I first went on the boat.  LEVINE: So they vaccinated everybody...  CONSTANTINE: Yes.  LEVINE: ...on the boat...  CONSTANTINE: Yes.  LEVINE: ...shortly after leaving Naples?  CONSTANTINE: Before.  LEVINE: Before.  CONSTANTINE: Before you, when you got on the boat, you were vaccinated. Everybody was vaccinated. Mine got infected. And from the infection of the vaccination I developed these fever sores. And I used to go to the hospital in boat to take care. But by the time I got here they were not any better. And so I had to stay here in Ellis Island.  LEVINE: Do you remember what the vaccination was for?  CONSTANTINE: No. I don't know.  LEVINE: So, so your mother was in good health, but she stayed because you had to be detained?  CONSTANTINE: I, yes.  LEVINE: So, so what happened? You were in the line, and they see that you have these fever sores, and then what happened next?  CONSTANTINE: Then I was taken away with my mother to somewhere else which I didn't know what it was, but it was a doctor's office. They examined me, and they saw that it was nothing that was danger or disease. It was just...  LEVINE: Infectious or anything?  CONSTANTINE: Yes. So they separated my mother and I. My mother waited in the waiting room, and they took me in another room. And they examined me, and they kept me there. Then the next thing I know, I was in the hospital. They were bathed and washed and they cleaned me up, and I had to stay there.  -- [pp. 18] --  LEVINE: And what was the hospital like?  CONSTANTINE: It was nice. It was clean. And it was very nice. The doctor's were so wonderful to me, and, and the nurses. I cried every night not knowing where my mother was.  LEVINE: Nobody told you?  CONSTANTINE: No. We were just separated. The last time I saw her was in the office room in the doctor's office. And then they took me to the hospital and they left my mother to go back maybe where she had to stay and wait for me. And there was a room where they kept these people. Now my brother couldn't go out because he was under age. And my cousin had to stay there and wait with my mother and my brother, because my sister worked and she could only come on the weekend to get her out. Because she was receiving us with my uncle. And we, they all had to wait. But there was a big where they all stayed together. And...  LEVINE: Your brother stayed with your cousin and your mother?  CONSTANTINE: Yes. And, and there were the people that had, did not pass for some, what would you call, a test, or whatever they were giving them. The question they were asking them. There was a girl staying there with my mother in the same room where she had to count twenty backwards. And she was always mixing her, her numbers. And she didn't pass. And my mother left her there. She still was detained on account of these numbers. But, you know, it was a, a silly, there's a word for it that I want to say.  -- [pp. 19] --  LEVINE: You mean a silly exercise?  CONSTANTINE: No. A silly, it's, these questions were not, that you needed, it was a catchy little thing. And it was an intelligent [sic] test. That's what it was. Trying to see how intelligent would ask, answer. This girl count, counting nine, twenty backwards. She would get mixed up, and my mother would hear her practice at night. And she would hear her practice and she would get all mixed up. She would go the next day for the test and she wouldn't pass. She's back there again. And like my cousin. How many feathers has a chicken. Now, if she started to hesitate, well, this one is a dummy. You know. (she laughs) So she gave them the right answer. And she said, ""You count them, let me know."" And she passed. So, it was a little intelligent test, that's what it was.  LEVINE: How, were you able to speak to any of the nurses or doctor's in the hospital?  CONSTANTINE: Well, I spoke Italian.  LEVINE: Did, did any of them speak Italian? Do you remember?  CONSTANTINE: They, they understood a little of it. They understood a little of it, but this is a dialect. It's not Italian. (she laughs)  LEVINE: Oh.  CONSTANTINE: You know, it's like the southerners have a dialect, the northern, Brooklyn, everybody knows who comes from Brooklyn. They have a way speaking. And it's, so, but they knew a little bit that, you know, that they understood. There wasn't too much to say. Just take care of me. And then they were so nice to me, you know, I cried when I come out. I, I didn't want, I didn't want to come out. (they laugh) Then when I saw my mother I was very happy, you know. And to today, when I pass a bridge, any bridge with lights at night, it reminds me of the time I was at Ellis Island.  -- [pp. 20] --  LEVINE: Oh.  CONSTANTINE: Because I used to look out of the window and I could see the bridge.  LEVINE: That's from the hospital room.  CONSTANTINE: Yeah. And I could see that, all the lights lit and wonder where my mother was, and wonder. I thought she went out. But they were all there waiting for me. Then we all come out together.  LEVINE: Well, let's see. So it was your sister who came and picked you up?  CONSTANTINE: Yes. My uncle also.  LEVINE: And your uncle.  CONSTANTINE: Oh, yes. Yeah.  LEVINE: Uh-huh. So where did you go when you left Ellis Island?  CONSTANTINE: Well, we lived in, in Brooklyn in a street called Utica Avenue. And my sister had already rented this little house before we got here, and everything was set before we come.  LEVINE: Now, how did the house compare with the house you had lived in in Italy?  CONSTANTINE: Oh, much better. Much better.  LEVINE: In what way?  CONSTANTINE: In atmosphere. In privacy, because we didn't have too much privacy, as a curtain, you know, it separated the rooms. And it was made, in Italy it was made like one big room separated with curtains, and these was your bedroom and your kitchen and, you know, whatever you, you know. But it was much nicer. In every way, you know, we found it much nicer. We, we loved this country the first minute we came.  -- [pp. 21] --  LEVINE: Do you remember any things about this country that struck you in the beginning as being different?  CONSTANTINE: Snow. Snow. It, when we first came out, because it was in January, there was a lot of snow. And Italy doesn't have much snow. Very seldom. That was different to us.  LEVINE: Yeah.  CONSTANTINE: To, my first impression, when we come out of the, you know, out of Ellis Island, and my sister was waiting. And we had a nice reunion, and we took the train and went home and we saw all this snow, different buildings. Completely different than our own home town. That was all it impressed, you know.  LEVINE: And how did your mother feel about being here?  CONSTANTINE: She loved it. She liked it. She was a woman that, I would say she was a pioneer. To leave, not knowing where we were going, and the only thing she had to look forward to that she had a brother here. And she knew that, you know, he would certainly see that we were taken care of.  LEVINE: What was your uncle's name?  CONSTANTINE: Thomas. He was my mother's brother.  LEVINE: Uh-huh. So, let's see. So, did you start school right away?  CONSTANTINE: Yes. They, I went into second grade. And...  LEVINE: What was that like?  CONSTANTINE: Well, it was so, it was so different. You don't know the language. And when you had, this comes to my mind, when I spell. You had to have a name sheet. S-H-E-E-T. And I said ""shit."" (they laugh) My daughters are laughing. And it was, it was hard at the beginning. But then you, you know, when you're young I think you get into it right away. And it wasn't too bad.  -- [pp. 22] --  LEVINE: Do you remember any incidents that happened while you were learning English, where maybe something clicked for you that you understood, or how you learned it, or anything like that?  CONSTANTINE: No. It, it, you know, you just paid atten"
Frances Pizzotti Polletta;Italy;"LEVINE: This is Janet Levine for the National Park Service, and I'm here today with Frances Pizzotti Polletta, who came from Italy in 1920 when she was twenty years old.

And you lived in the same town, Ferrandino, until you were twenty. POLLETTA: Yes. LEVINE: Now, could you tell me about the town? What's that town like? POLLETTA: Nothing special. It was a nice town. -- [pp. 2] --  LEVINE: Was it big? POLLETTA: A very good size. LEVINE: Yeah. And what did people do there? POLLETTA: Oh, any kind of work. LEVINE: Was it a farming place? POLLETTA: Well, my sister, one of my sisters, she go to my mother and father's place to work. And I stay in Ferrandino, had two families that had no water in the house. So I fetch the water every day long, carry the pan. LEVINE: Where did you get the water? POLLETTA: They had to open fountain in the city, the town. LEVINE: So did lots of people go to the fountain? POLLETTA: Sure. LEVINE: To get the water. POLLETTA: To get the water, the water run all time. LEVINE: And how did you carry it? POLLETTA: By hand, the pan. LEVINE: And how often would you go? POLLETTA: Well, I go three times a day, each two family, and the rest I clean the house, my house. My mother go to work, and I take care of home. The next day I do the same thing again. And there was one lady, she was a widow, she had two grown-up daughters, but she was afraid to let them go to school all alone. And she hired me to go along. One was almost older than I was. But she no trust that, you know. LEVINE: To go to school? POLLETTA: No, to go, to take the girl to the school, just walk together. She want to make sure that she went to school safe and everything goes fine. -- [pp. 3] --  LEVINE: So that was a job you had? POLLETTA: They paid me for that. She was a widow. She was really nice, a good family. LEVINE: Now, did you go to school? POLLETTA: Yes. LEVINE: And do you remember the school that you went to? POLLETTA: This, no. There was, they used to call the Familial School for Girl, and boy, Musket for the boy. LEVINE: They were separate? POLLETTA: There was a name, that's all. I went until the sixth grade. LEVINE: And was it a Catholic school? POLLETTA: Yeah. No, it was a public school. LEVINE: Public school. Uh-huh. What do you remember about school that you liked? POLLETTA: Well, I liked it. There was no law at that time to push to go to school where I come from. But I did it. My two sisters, they don't want to go to school, and nobody bothered. But I told my mother, I says, ""I want to go to school,"" so she let me go. LEVINE: Uh-huh. You're the only one of the children who went? POLLETTA: Yeah, that's right. LEVINE: Do you know why you wanted to go? POLLETTA: Because I liked to be writing and read. LEVINE: Now, in your family there was your mother, father. POLLETTA: No, just my mother. LEVINE: Just your mother. POLLETTA: My father was here in the United States. -- [pp. 4] --  LEVINE: Your father came first. POLLETTA: Yes. LEVINE: And what was your mother's maiden name? POLLETTA: Francesca. LEVINE: Francesca was her first name? POLLETTA: Yeah. LEVINE: And her second name before she . . . POLLETTA: Francesca Pase Pizzotti. LEVINE: Uh-huh. And how do you spell her maiden name? Do you know? POLLETTA: My name? LEVINE: No. Your mother's maiden name, before she was married. POLLETTA: Pase. LEVINE: P-A . . . POLLETTA: S, give me the pen. ( she writes ) ( she pauses ) ( voices speak off mike ) LEVINE: After a little break. So you spell it P-A-C-E? POLLETTA: P-A-S-E. LEVINE: S-E, P-A-S-E. Okay. And Francesca. POLLETTA: That's it. Francesca Pase Pizzotti. LEVINE: Okay. And your father, what was his first name? POLLETTA: Antonio Pizzotti. LEVINE: And your brothers and sisters. What were their names? POLLETTA: My sisters? LEVINE: Brothers and sisters. POLLETTA: I don't got no brother. LEVINE: No brother. POLLETTA: I had two sisters, three sisters. One in Italy, she's dead, and two that came over here after. I come one my older sister, the oldest one. She was twenty-six, I was twenty. And that make me understand, see, if I don't come, without her she could not come, because she didn't know how to write or read. So when I reach on a Battery there, everybody got in, they make me read for her and for me. That's it. -- [pp. 5] --  LEVINE: Okay. So what were your two sisters' names? POLLETTA: Susan. LEVINE: Susan. POLLETTA: Yes, Sunta. That's the Italian way. LEVINE: And how about the other one? POLLETTA: Uh, Josephine. Josephine. LEVINE: And do you remember the house you lived in? POLLETTA: Over here? In Italy? Oh, yeah. LEVINE: What was it like? POLLETTA: Rotten. LEVINE: What? POLLETTA: Rotten. LEVINE: Rotten? ( they laugh ) Was it big or small or . . . POLLETTA: Oh, it was big enough, but old-fashioned. LEVINE: Old-fashioned. Uh-huh. And how was it different from this house, say. What's the difference? POLLETTA: Over here? LEVINE: Yeah. POLLETTA: Everything. LEVINE: Like what? POLLETTA: Everything around. The way you see it, that's the way I got it. I rented it for vacation there for a couple of week, but I died to come home. LEVINE: Oh, really. POLLETTA: I mean, how much I love, I like Rome, but no, I says oh, I not go back, back home. LEVINE: Because it's a lot more primitive than your house here, right? POLLETTA: Oh, yeah. LEVINE: Well, you didn't have running water. Is that right? You had to go get the water. POLLETTA: On my farm. Yes. But not in Rome. -- [pp. 6] --  LEVINE: Not Rome, no. POLLETTA: Over there they had hot water in the house. LEVINE: So you had to get water. POLLETTA: Help with the labor, (?), used to call one lire. LEVINE: And what did your mother do? Did your mother have to work when your father was here? POLLETTA: She worked like a man. LEVINE: Yeah. What kind of work did she do? POLLETTA: She would dig and plant and pack, everything, work on the garden. LEVINE: And what kind of, was it a farm town? POLLETTA: It was too close and not too far. I have to walk in the morning and night. LEVINE: What kind of things did people grow in and around? POLLETTA: Like over here. Everything they plant they pick it up. See, my brother, when I went to Italy, that's not my brother, my nephew, and he had a big farm. He had everything. Over here you have to buy everything. LEVINE: Did you grow things to eat for your family there when you lived there? Did you . . . POLLETTA: I never went. Far away to go. LEVINE: Did you grow what you ate? Did you grow vegetables that you also ate? POLLETTA: Yeah, they do that. Yeah, like over here, broccoli, beans and peas, corn. In fact, when we come back say goodbye to my sister that time, my natural sister. He had a big bed of corn grown, already clean. And he had wheat, oh, yeah, grain. He says, you see, the miller pick it up and take out the (?). Molido, they call over here. They grind to make the flour. They had a (?) flour and add white flour with the grain. They enjoyed it. I mean, I like to say all that, because I forget it. But still I wanted to come back over here because it was my family or whatever. I was dying to come back. -- [pp. 7] --  LEVINE: Well, did you remember your father? POLLETTA: Oh, yeah. LEVINE: When did your father leave? How old were you? POLLETTA: Oh, that's a big guess. I don't remember my father at all. I think I was maybe six, seven years old. I mean, I lost his age completely. I don't remember. But now we're going to go, I remember when I reach over here. LEVINE: Well first tell me, before you left, before you left your town. How did it get decided that you would go? POLLETTA: My father called the family. LEVINE: He called? POLLETTA: I mean, he requested to move over here. LEVINE: He wrote to you to come. POLLETTA: Yes. He sent enough money for four people. But the war broke and they shut up the port and everything else, and my mother remembered we used to go to Rome to refresh the passport, to stamp again, to wait. So the war was over and we go on, there was a leader there. He said you have to wait for five months before you travel because they were afraid that the bomb was underwater yet. They had to make sure. So when he called my mother says, ""All right."" But the money my mother had for the trip was gone, and it wasn't enough. LEVINE: How long was it from the time you were supposed to leave until you did leave? POLLETTA: To take the boat? Oh, maybe pretty good one hour and a half, or more than that. From my place to Naples, that's where we get out on the boat, in Naples, Italy. And we travelled fifteen days. -- [pp. 8] --  LEVINE: Do you remember leaving your town to go to Naples? POLLETTA: Huh? LEVINE: Do you remember when you left your town? POLLETTA: Oh, yes. LEVINE: Did, was it a sad time because you were leaving? POLLETTA: For me it was. LEVINE: What did you, why didn't you want to go? POLLETTA: Just because I was feeling like I didn't want to come, and I let my father know that. I write a letter to him. I says, ""You're going to push me,"" I says, ""you're going to be sorry."" And I wrote that because I was mad. LEVINE: You really came for your sister's sake. Is that why you came? POLLETTA: That's right. For my sister's sake, that's God's truth. LEVINE: So you didn't really want to come. POLLETTA: Because if I don't come, she can't come. My mother was disappointed. Everybody else in the family home. LEVINE: So you were the only one in the family who would read and write. POLLETTA: That's right. LEVINE: So you came with your mother? POLLETTA: No. My mother come 1921. LEVINE: And you came in 1920. And so it was just you and your sister? POLLETTA: My younger sister came with my mother. LEVINE: So you came with your older sister? POLLETTA: The older sister. LEVINE: And was there a big farewell when you and your sister left? -- [pp. 9] --  POLLETTA: Oh, yes. We had kind of a good night the night before. LEVINE: What did you do? POLLETTA: Well, I came through, I see a lady, just about like that. Nothing else (?). She came and she ( adjusts her position ), my arm. She came and she brought me a little package like this, two package. One Vincenzo and another one was Candido. ( a telephone rings ) Two sons she had, Maria. LEVINE: Can somebody else get that? ( discussion off mike ) POLLETTA: So she had two son over here, (?). And they says, you please, she (?). I hope to God they want you, (?) old lady. I hope to God (?) cemetery (?) marry my son, which I did. ( they laugh ) LEVINE: Now, what did she give you? I didn't understand. POLLETTA: She give me a package of cigarette, a pack of cigarette. One was Marcitonia, I remember the name. The other one was Virginia. I never forgot that. LEVINE: And she gave you that to give to her son? POLLETTA: Right. That's the gift that she sent to the son. She can't do anything any more, was an old lady, that way. LEVINE: Did you know her son from before? POLLETTA: Well, I used to like that, because if I want to say yes, was too far away. I never, but, you know one another, but not to be friendly. Come a (?), when I reach, my cousin, we went to the house. I says, ""I got this my cousin Dominick."" He says, ""Dominick, you know this two party?"" ""Oh, yeah."" He said, ""I work down at Betts."" -- [pp. 10] --  LEVINE: Down where? POLLETTA: Betts, a shoe shop, Betts. I says, ""Yeah."" He says, ""Who give you this?"" I says, ""Your mother."" He says, ""Well, we're going to arrange that we're going to go some night to the house."" So they took me down to the house. She turned out to be my sister-in-law and my brother-in-law. And the other brother, the one I married, he was there, too. So it was, I'm shocked because my (?) was too strange for him, but we see it like that. And I says, ""Oh, shake hands."" I was so happy. I says, ""Your mother sent this."" I says, ""And to Candido."" He says, ""That's me."" I says, ""I know which one is Vincenzo."" I said, ""That's for you."" He shook hands. I says, ""Thanks so much."" He start to cry. He likes his mother very much. He was the younger one in the family. So that's it. So then we started to be friends. Today, tomorrow, next week. One wrote a little letter, and they ask to my father, later on, say you could let her to get married. So (?). I was working at Steven's. LEVINE: What's Stephen's? POLLETTA: Steven, tha's a big mill there. VOICE OFF MIKE: It's the largest woolen in the world, a smoking mill. POLLETTA: So I was working there. LEVINE: You were working there. Well, what did your father say when . . . POLLETTA: Well, my father had (?). We get out of the train, and there, on the station over here, and he motion to me. He look at his clock, watch, he says, ""You wait. Eight o'clock."" Never say that. The (?) says, ""Your father going to come pick you up."" So we went. Nobody was inside there, just the man in the window for ticket. So I heard a little noise outside, talking. And I get up, and I just say to them, my sister says, ""Where are you going?"" I say, ""Shh."" So I just opened the door a little bit, I see all the men that were working on a railroad truck, the one that carry the fork or the shovel, all working men. And my sister says, ""Shut the door there."" And I (?). She call out my name, ""Kikina."" It was a nickname. My father heard that, he was in that group. He say, ""Gee, that's my daughters!"" He knew we was going to come but he didn't know the day. Because of the boat, they're locked on the water. They all was scared. So when he come, and my sister recognize a little bit, because (?). But definitely (?). So we had a nice day in New York, to my cousin and the family. -- [pp. 11] --  LEVINE: So what was it like to be around your father after you . . . POLLETTA: Oh, I love my father very much. But just like separated, lost forever. The way he looked, the way he was. But when I see I think everything come back in a minute. Yeah. LEVINE: And, well, let's back up a minute. When you were leaving you went to Naples. POLLETTA: Yes. LEVINE: Now, how did you get from your town to Naples. POLLETTA: By train. LEVINE: By train. And how long did it take you? POLLETTA: It take a couple hours, more than that. LEVINE: And then did you leave right away, or did you stay in Naples? POLLETTA: No, we stayed, we spent a night in Naples. LEVINE: And why did you spend a night there? POLLETTA: Because the boat wasn't ready. So they give us a room. They go with money, to trip. LEVINE: The steamship company. Did you stay in a place with a steamship? POLLETTA: Yeah. And they paid for the room for us. So in the morning we get up, we have an alarm. Wait till the time come, somebody lead us, they wanted people with the baggage. That is the time they take it in on the boat. LEVINE: Do you remember what you took with you or what your sister took? Do you remember anything that you packed to take to America? POLLETTA: It were all strange people, some you know, some you don't know. It was always different. -- [pp. 12] --  LEVINE: Well, did you have a suitcase? POLLETTA: Yes. LEVINE: What was in it? Do you remember? POLLETTA: Clothes. LEVINE: That's it? POLLETTA: That's it. LEVINE: Your sister, too? POLLETTA: That's right. She lost it, too. LEVINE: Do you remember how, you lost it? ( Mrs. Polletta laughs. ) How did you lose it? POLLETTA: We just missed. LEVINE: When did you lose it? POLLETTA: I think it was in New York. We got everything when we get out of the boat. But I fell. I even twisted my foot, I get off lame. There was those big ropes there, up high, and I was so fresh to go by them. I walk outside, and I fall. One man take me up. I says, right away I walk lame. My foot never did get over that. LEVINE: And that was getting off that boat? POLLETTA: Yeah. Maybe it was still on the boat. So half of the way to go because it was a lot of people. The boat was full. I don't know how many. LEVINE: Were you down in the bottom of the boat? POLLETTA: That's right. They used to call it third class. LEVINE: It was a big dormitory. POLLETTA: Yeah. He had a wall, he had a piece of everything (?) on the night. LEVINE: Was it bunk beds? POLLETTA: Yeah. LEVINE: And a lot of them in one big place? -- [pp. 13] --  POLLETTA: Oh, yeah. And it was a lot more. LEVINE: And did, where did you eat when you were on the ship? POLLETTA: We're going to go up and open air, and they put the table. It was six from my home town. We know one another. So they put six together. And my sister was sick. She had, she's sick the second she come in on the boat. She was sick all of the fifteen days. She never eat. LEVINE: Was she seasick? POLLETTA: She was like this. So they give you vaccination, and the vaccination went wrong. She had an arm big like that, all red. Every day she had to go to take care of that. And they told her if the arm don't get better by next week they're going to send you back. And she was real scared to death. She don't want to go back. I don't blame her. But I was the one a little stronger, yes, whatever. (?) LEVINE: So do you remember when the boat came into New York Harbor? POLLETTA: Sure, I remember that. We get out there, and they used to call Batteria. You have to walk a little ways, with a bag and a hat. And we reached there, then it was too far, really. So when we were inside there, my God, the people was back. And my sister, she was holding on to me, because I got, that put in line. So when I reach there the man lead me to go to read. It was like this, glass on the top and the writing was on the bottom. So I have to read everything what was there, what they mean. -- [pp. 14] --  LEVINE: You could read it? POLLETTA: Yeah. So I says in Italian, I say to him. I says, ""I come to my father."" All those words. ""My father call us to come over here to be with him, and later on my mother going to come with my sister."" That was one for me, another one was for my sister, the same thing. I have to sign my name and I have to sign her name. They'll let you go, you know. Still you can't go to land. They lead to another room. So they took my sister, and she disappear. I was scared to death. I says, ""Oh, my God, where is she now? They're going to send her back in Italy."" I don't know what to think. Because I see the chalk that they some letter on the back. They're going to stand, like a ""C"". So I don't know, to me. But later on I see the people we come together all disappeared to one place or another, because we don't come all on the same place. One they go Chicago, Philadelphia, whatever. We don't see no other company we get to eat. So, but finally I was just (?). I see when a man look at me, just look, but he no move. But when I see my sister, they open the door, she come back. I says, ""Where you were?"" She says, ""In there."" She says, ""They check my eye, gave me maybe some physical check up."" I says, ""Are you all right?"" She says, ""Yeah."" She didn't talk too much. She was scared. I was the one with the big mouth. I don't like it, but I have to do for her and for me. So anyway they told us to go sit in here (?), we went to sit. No more boat and no more our friend. So we sit and we was feeling angry. I see then that was a little store, now I say that. I know it was a store. I says, ""It must sell food."" So my sister said, ""Where are you going?"" It was from here maybe to the garage, my garage. And I see the stuff there. They had bananas. I never see banana before. I see the man walking by, he had a banana, he had a crackers, he had bread. I says, ""Oh, I'm going to see what I want."" So the man ask what I can do. I said, ""That."" I pointed to a banana. I say, ""Yeah."" I said, ""That."" He said, ""Money."" He put the three banana in the bag. I said, ""A box of crackers."" All right, put in a bag. And I see the bread, the same thing. So I was going to see how much it cost, I was going to see, and I had in my hands like this. He says, I don't know if it was five dollars or whatever. I went like this, and I take off the money. ( Mrs. Polletta disturbs her microphone as she demonstrates her gestures. ) I take it out. So he give me the change, but it was Italian money, but he give me back American money. He give me three dollars back. I said, ""Geez!"" And I see the lady along there, and I tried to make my sister laugh. I says, ""Look."" ""Ah, I don't want to see that."" She was still afraid. She don't believe she was on her way out. So we went. At the same time we started to eat a bit, a piece of cheese. The conductor come. He went like this. He motioned pick it up the baggage, to follow him. So we followed him, not too far gone. We were still near the water, practically. And we get in. I thought it was hours. But when we get in, when we sit I can feel the water. -- [pp. 15] --  LEVINE: The ship moving? POLLETTA: The ship move. I says, ""Oh, my God."" My sister, that's all she had on her mind. I said, ""We're going back to Italy."" Somebody laugh. They were Italian, we went a little out on deck. That's we see the Liberty statue. So I'm talking to my sister, I say, ""Look, La Madonna."" I thought it was the Madonna. I don't know why, God bless. And we go back and we sit, and it come the dark. I think it was five o'clock. It was another conductor again, and make like this. It's five o'clock train. We go New London and we get, I couldn't get a job, but I had work. We reach (?), no longer (?). Just five minutes to five. So we get out of there, the conductor come again. Lead inside the station, and we sit. It was full of people. We didn't know nobody, and nobody know us. So we sat there, and all the people go by, back and forth. END OF SIDE ONE BEGINNING OF SIDE TWO LEVINE: I said, ""Geez, I see the man."" I don't tell my sister that. I see the man go back and forth. What he want? I was kind of scared. But then the people started to slow down, he come. He says, ""I can ask to work, please."" I said, ""I understand."" Then he started talking Italian. He says, ""I want that place there, Palazzo. He says, the motel, everything. He says, ""I got a business, and I got coffee and doughnuts downstairs. My wife work there. And I see you two girls ain't got nobody over here, not to say hello, not to give a glass of water."" He says, ""I offer you my."" He was a very nice man. He says, ""You're going to stay here overnight, I won't trust it. You have to sleep on those, you know, those, on a seat."" My sister says, ""Yeah?"" He says, ""Yeah."" So we follow him because it was right across the street. It take two minutes, we have to stop for the car. After we get in there there was the smell already kitchen. And he says, ""Get in."" We get in, it was one step. He put us to sit on the stool by there, and we drink a coffee. He says, ""Have a cup of coffee, doughnut."" He says, ""On my honor."" He was a real nice gentleman. So we eat. Then we lead upstairs. It was one floor. And we passed a couple door. Before the door, he take off his key, a bunch of keys and he open the door. It was a bedroom. He said, ""That's the best I can do it."" I introduce to his wife first. He says, ""Sure, it's a good thing, go ahead."" So he opened the door. He said, ""That's the bed."" There was a bureau, a beautiful room. I never seen in Italy that. Clean carpet. I was real impressed. And I says, ""Grazie."" And I said, ""Thank you very much."" He says, ""Not yet. Tomorrow morning a train will come five o'clock. The conductor says that again. Ten after five, he have to go away all night, to the five o'clock train. But he come, he was more gentle. He come, he knock on the door. He say, ""If you hear my name, open the door, you know that's me. And I do better than that."" He says, ""I'm going to leave the key right inside. If somebody else want to open they can't open because the key was in."" He says, he was a real gentleman. He come, it was a half past four, to take the five o'clock train to come over here. It don't take long, but long enough. And that's it. ( A man makes an off-mike comment in Italian. ) Oh, come on. ( they laugh ) -- [pp. 16] --  VOICE OFF MIKE: You didn't tell us where the toilet was. POLLETTA: No, that's a shame, no. God forbid, God forbid. He was nice, that man, for everything. But he didn't show us where's the bathroom. So when we get up in the morning we didn't know where to go. Where do we look? There was a door. I didn't want to bother the door. I says it may be somebody else. So we went the other side. So we wait a little bit. What are we going to do? I can't hold it. So I sent a telegram to my father because he take all of my dress over here. The telegram reach there, we was there already, over here already. I ask my father, I says, ""Repair a little damage."" I says this, that. He says, ""What do you want me to do, send the money to that guy?"" ""Well,"" I says, ""he do a lot of thing. He did a lot for us. We have no place to go."" He says, my father never work. (?) better. My mother, she started us off straight, and we started to grow up, but she never said much. What I seen with my own eye, rest her soul. She didn't send nothing after the man to clean the carpet. I'm sorry, it's not that. I said, ""Gee, all your life, and now you can't do yourself."" There was another one. My father didn't want to work over here, and had enough. I had a big family. And besides, a crippled boy, you know, that take a lot. That's my life. LEVINE: Let's see. Is there anything else about the voyage or coming into New York or . . . POLLETTA: Just a second. Mark, get me water. -- [pp. 17] --  LEVINE: Is there anything, when you first got to this country, was there anything that struck you as different, that were different from anything you had experienced. POLLETTA: I got (?). We find everything, we don't have any. Every easy way, everything. When we landed to my cousin over here, then it was too far from the station. I see the sink, the water run in the house. You open the jars to make a coffee, and we don't have any of that. I find all the convenience, we never had it. And I thank God He put me in this world and this land. LEVINE: So were you glad you had come? Soon after you got here, were you glad that you had come? Because you weren't too happy about coming here in the beginning. You didn't want to come that much. LEVINE: Not that much. POLLETTA: But then when you came here, did you like it right away? POLLETTA: Oh, yeah, I like it. I find my brother over here, he was waiting for us. And we had a bigger store, Jewish, and we had the best clothes in Webster. So the day after this, he said, ""Come on."" Bring us to the store. He dress up, everything what we needed. I says, ""Am I keeping my dress?"" He answered, ""No."" He says, ""That's hell. Throw it away."" He didn't want me to wear it. And I also liked that dress. My shoes, I had shoes made. Just the same, he wanted me to throw them away. Anyway, he dress up from the shoes to there. LEVINE: Did he want you to throw away your clothes because he didn't want you to look like an immigrant? -- [pp. 18] --  POLLETTA: Maybe things like that, but instead there was a lot that I have to keep. Anyway, I have to get right outfit after. LEVINE: Do you remember what clothes you came over in? POLLETTA: Huh? LEVINE: Do you remember the clothes you had on when you came? POLLETTA: Dress, yes. It was handmade. LEVINE: What were they like? POLLETTA: They were (?), but I never seen anything over here like it. Something like that. And they had a big three button on the front. It was cute. I liked it because it was special, somebody made for me. My sister says, ""They're good enough."" She was glad, after. And my shoes were nice shoes. They were tennis shoes, same color what they got over here. And that's everything handmade. No machine. They stitch the shoes. They go this way, then the needle go there, another one go over here. That kind of stitch. I remember all that. So little by little and little by little. When I think about my sister, she never have gone out to the door. She sit and she started the crochet. She make a little bedspread. Me, I have to go to work. My father says, ""Go look for a job."" ( they laugh ) I says, ""What?"" ""Go look for a job."" I says, ""What's that?"" He can't speak English either. ( they laugh ) I can't say that. So my girlfriend, she was half French, but she learned to speak Italian so plain. She says, ""He wants you to go to work."" I says, ""Why don't you go to work?"" To my father. He says, ""(?), don't go to work."" He was (?). Anyway, I have a girlfriend of mine, she found me a job at Stevens. And that was an easy way. I don't know what was harder, to find a job, because you have to change a lot of things, the way you work. But I told them, ""Give me easy job. No tough, no do this and no do that."" Just put the work inside a (?) a day, if you have the next row. So he did. He was a German guy, a nice gentle man, tall, moustache. And he come. So he give me the job. And the two girls, the, one was my cousin, says, ""Now we teach you something. First,"" she said, ""the bus is going to come tomorrow morning."" And I asked where. She says, ""At the job."" I says, ""What you want me to do?"" She says, ""You're going to go like this: Good morning."" She says, ""You say 'good morning.'"" The next morning she says, ""You're going to do the same again."" I says, ""Why do you ask me?"" She says you like the job, you say a little bit. But I got a paper to make talk me like that. I last about three weeks. ( they laugh ) I tell you, I went through my hell, and that's what I am. That's awful. But I was nice. They were very, just I would feel sorry for my sister because she never eat a bit, nothing at all. She was real sick. -- [pp. 19] --  LEVINE: Well, then, um . . . POLLETTA: I was sick. I was sorry because she was sick, and I was mad because she push me to come. That's it. But after I forget. I enjoy it, my life, the best I could. LEVINE: And then your mother came the next year. POLLETTA: My mother the following year, it was 1921. She come to me by the mill. Some French girl deliver to my cousin. So when I see my mother she says, ""Oh, my God."" Oh, I was so happy then. LEVINE: What was your mother like? POLLETTA: Oh, she was a nice lady. You know, any time she write a letter, she wanted to know what I'm doing. And I lied to her. I says I go to school and I got nothing else to do. All the while I go to work. I go make a (?) for Domenick. When she saw me I says, ""Oh, my God, that's not my daughter."" My sister says, ""Oh, yes, she is."" She come closer and closer and she cry and I cry. It was real happy and sad for a long time. She says, ""You're telling me you used to go to school."" I says, ""I did."" I says, ""I graduate."" ( they laugh ) I don't want to tell her what I was doing. Poor my mother. You know how long she live over here? Nine years. She no live long, and she no wants to go neither. LEVINE: Were there some kinds of things that your mother tried to have you learn? Are there things that your mother taught you that she wanted you to . . . POLLETTA: My mother, she don't know nothing at all. She just take the way my father want, so he did the best. He says, ""You stay there, you don't got nothing at the job."" The job, just like a laborer, I'm in jail there, go to work every morning. And he says there's no future. So my sister, she really wanted to come, but me, I was different. I don't want to come. And I told my father in a letter. I says, ""If you push me,"" I says, ""you'll be sorry."" But I never did nothing, just talk. I like my father just the same. But I like my mother, but I don't want to come. But I was also pretty good. I went to work at Steven's, and after I started he had a little shop upstairs, for the blouse. And I was a little bit smart in that. I used to sew a little bit. They have a dressmaker right next to my, where I used to live. On a Saturday night if she had a lot of work to finish the people from the farm, they all come back on a Saturday and I pick her up to buy things. I says, ""You got whatever it is to be done?"" She says, ""You want to help me?"" I says, ""Sure."" There was another girl named Bianca, Biancina. Every day we worked on a Friday night. She came a couple of lire, and was happy. -- [pp. 20] --  LEVINE: Were there a lot of Italian people in Webster when you came? POLLETTA: Well, there were a lot, but now it's all gone. LEVINE: Were there a lot of other immigrants from other countries, too? POLLETTA: But there was no one to come from my place. I mean, don't mix. A couple, they come from Sorbin"

Bedford-Stuyvesant Community Cooperative Audio Tapes;Durham, North Carolina, United States. In 1967 two white sociologists, Gerald Schaflander and Henry Etzkowitz, and their students joined with black residents of Brooklyn's Bedford-Stuyvesant section to build an inter-racial neighborhood Co-op. The Bedford-Stuyvesant Community Cooperative offered generic medicines, foodstuffs, and other goods at discounted prices, and reinvested the profits back into the neighborhood to support a range of social services, child care, medical care, and educational support, for example. By 1968 the Co-op operated a parking lot, a gas station, a general store, a pharmacy, and a child care center. In the minds of its founders the Co-op stood as a rebuke to both the growing racialism of black nationalism and a testament against the unchecked immorality of American capitalism. The audiotapes comprising this collection capture numerous board, staff, and community meetings as well as interviews with the founders, directors, and committee members. The tapes reveal the struggles and conflicts of establishing and maintaining the Co-op, including discussions on hirings, firings, division of labor, finances, and neighborhood violence.

Cayman Islands Memory Bank;Georgetown, Grand Cayman, Cayman Islands, Cayman Islands. While these changes brought much that was good, including economic prosperity, they also brought problems. One of these was the threat to our culture, as our traditions were swamped in a flood of movies, television, newspapers, etc. from abroad, primarily the U.S., and the influence of so many non-Caymanians, from much older cultures than our own, in the society. Faced with these influences, the old ways began to be forgotten and, indeed, in the minds of some, grew the idea that Cayman did not have a culture of its own, which in turn led to a sort of cultural inferiority complex. In the early 1980's, many Caymanians became very concerned about all of this and work began which eventually resulted in the establishment of the National Cultural Foundation, National Museum, National Trust and National Archive. As part of this initiative, a group of concerned young adults began interviewing older Caymanians on audio tape in order to document the old traditions and way of life. This developed into the Memory Bank, which eventually was recognized by the Government as very important and made part of the National Archive in 1991. All of those earlier tapes are part of the collection.

Frank Chin Oral History Collection;"Pullman, Washington, United States.

The interviews, all done either by Chin or Lawson Inada, are with Japanese Americans who were either native born, second generation Americans (Nisei), permanent U.S. residents born in Japan (Issei), or their family members. During World War II they became the focus of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order 9066, issued on February 19, 1942. The result of Roosevelt's order was to strip the Nisei of their citizenship and both groups of their constitutional rights. Under the auspices of the War Relocation Authority, the Selective Service required both groups to answer a questionnaire that, among other things, questioned their willingness to serve in the U.S. military and their willingness to repudiate their allegiance to Japan. One group of Japanese American resisters became known as the ""No-No Boys"" because they answered negatively to both these questions. The people interviewed in these tapes were directly or indirectly affected by these events and they offer a variety of perspectives on their significance. During World War II, roughly 110,000 Japanese Americans were imprisoned in U.S. government-run camps known as relocation centers. Other Japanese Americans willingly served in the U.S. military during World War II. "

From Porch Swings to Patios;"Charlottesville, Virginia, United States.

The recordings and transcripts of interviews presented here, however, are only those of African Americans. Although black residents occupied several different neighborhoods within the city limits from the mid-nineteenth century on, the people interviewed for ""Porch Swings"" and represented on this site came from the Vinegar Hill area. Vinegar Hill encompassed a section of West Main street that began at downtown Charlottesville and extended west toward the campus of the University of Virginia. The area was composed mostly of businesses owned by Charlottesville's black citizens, and though the stores catered to the black population, they served both black and white clientele. In the early 1960s, Charlottesville's city officials designated Vinegar Hill as a blighted area in need of an overhaul. Following a national trend, a sweeping ""urban renewal"" project was carried out that ostensibly removed decrepit buildings and cleared unsightly landscape for improved sanitation and overall appearance. In these interviews, former Vinegar Hill residents share their thoughts on the extent to which those promises for improvement were fulfilled or not. "

International Economic Policymaking and the National Security Council Oral History;Washington, District of Columbia, United States.

Long Beach Area History: Responses to Subsidence and the Tidelands Controversy;Long Beach, California, United States. In the late 1930s, oil was discovered under Long Beach harbor. Its production helped Long Beach recover from the Depression and provided revenue to support expansion and modernization of the harbor as well as enriching individuals who owned land in the area. As a result when land near the oil field began to sink, those who were profiting from pumping the oil out from under the land resisted any suggestion that there could be a link between oil production and subsidence. They hired experts to defend their position. As the subsidence continued, those whose property was damaged by the sinking, but who were not benefiting from the oil production, hired experts to determine what was really causing the sinking. 
Long Beach Area History: Signal Hill;Long Beach, California, United States. Oil was discovered on Signal Hill, north of the City of Long Beach, in 1921.

As more people moved into the area to work on the wells and the developments that followed them, people in pre-existing neighborhoods worried that the field's spread might bring out of control wells, smelly sump holes and dangerous equipment near their homes. In response, Long Beach adopted regulations that limited oil development. Even as the City incorporated outlying neighborhoods that filled with the homes of oil workers and those in related industries, people on top of the hill, near the center of petroleum development, resisted. And in 1926 they incorporated their own City of Signal Hill which is completely surrounded by the City of Long Beach.

Lutheran Family Folklore/Folklife Oral History;"Albuquerque, New Mexico, United States.

The families are descendants of Norwegian, Swedish, German, Danish, and Finnish cultures who, during the earlier part of the twentieth century, were all members of the Lutheran Church. A problem arose in the church over what language the sermons and prayers should be conducted in. The Church wanted to ""assimilate"" the different ethnic groups and provide English services because many of the children did not understand the languages of their parents. As a result, language and culture began to be over-taken by the new American culture. Many churches tried to maintain their ethnicity, but during World War I, legislation was passed prohibiting the public use of foreign languages, especially German. This further limited the Church members' ability to maintain their ethnic traditions. "

Musical Development in Southern California: Jazz Composers, Arrangers and Performers;Long Beach, California, United States. The Hollywood film and recording studios served as a magnet, attracting many talented jazz and commercial musicians to Los Angeles. Yet, little is known of the role that Los Angeles played in the development of jazz, especially the early extension of New Orleans, Chicago and Kansas City jazz. For example, Paul Whiteman's first major success came with his appearance at the Alexandria Hotel in downtown Los Angeles in 1919, and in the early 1920s, nearly every major New Orleans figure who went to Chicago also appeared in Los Angeles. By the 1930s, Louis Armstrong was in Los Angeles (1931-32) making records, and Benny Goodman and his band appeared here in 1935 in an event that several jazz historians mark as the beginning of the popularity of the swing era. Lionel Hampton had been in Los Angeles since 1925, the year that radio station KFI did the first Los Angeles to New York radio broadcast.

Norfolk Museums and Archaeology Service Oral History Collection;"Norfolk, England, United Kingdom. For the museums service reminiscence work is a two-way process. The memories of everyday life are invaluable sources of information which help us to more truthfully reflect social history in exhibitions. When taped and broadcast alongside museum objects or used in other ways to aid interpretation, they provide a fascinating insight into the history of an era or a place. Collecting oral history also enables us to involve people in museum activities, through their contribution to exhibition and education programmes. An example of such work is the Great Yarmouth Museums millennium collecting project, designed to produce a snapshot of everyday life in the Borough during 2000. Community groups and business organisations have been invited to fill a cardboard box with material representative of everyday life and associated oral ""history"" has been recorded. As completed boxes arrive back at the museum offices they will be displayed in the foyer at the library. This will be updated monthly and the whole project will culminate in 2001 with a touring exhibition of all the collected material. As well as providing the museums with new collections it is hoped this project will encourage a greater sense of ownership from Borough residents towards their museums. In general, oral history collection often means the museum is donated objects and photographs, builds new audiences and supporters and helps us to achieve a positive profile in the older community.

The University Library‚Äôs Regional History Project announces the publication of Out in the Redwoods: Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgender History at the University of California, Santa Cruz, 1965-2003. This documentary, multigenerational oral history book is based on twenty-seven oral history interviews with UCSC students, alumni, and staff. The interviews were conducted by eleven UCSC students who were trained in an oral history internship course, as well as a team of community volunteers. Ten narrative essays by UCSC alumni are also included. Out in the Redwoods has been published as a 350-page illustrated paperback, featuring a poetic montage of excerpts from the oral histories, and the full narratives. Also included is a cd-rom including the full transcripts of the oral histories and other resources. The project was coordinated and edited by oral historian Irene Reti. The book also includes an introduction, timeline, bibliography, and other reference material. This book connects the LGBT past with the present. The history of UCSC spans the historical timeline from before Stonewall, through the rise of the feminist movement, the gay liberation movement, and other leftist student movements of the 1960s and 1970s, the flourishing of women's studies, the battle against AIDS, to the queer student activism of the past two decades. Nationally, UC Santa Cruz has been a magnetic center of LGBT culture and activism. At this critical crossroads in history those who witnessed and participated in the birth of a movement of liberation have been able and willing to share their singular historical experiences with the continuing generation of LGBT college students.

Naturalization laws, alien lands laws, ""anti-miscegenation"" laws, housing restrictions, and immigration laws continued to exclude Japanese Americans from taking their rightful place in American society. REgenerations will explore the struggle of Japanese Americans to overcome these institutional and social barriers and restore their family and community life which had been fragmented by the wartime experience.

Ridge Street Oral Histories;Charlottesville, Virginia, United States. In 1981, the Ridge Street Historic District was placed on the Virginia Landmarks Register and the National Register of Historic Places because of its role as one of Charlottesville's architecturally significant late-nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century residential areas. The first residences in the Ridge Street Neighborhood were built around 1840, and construction continued into the twentieth century, eventually subsiding toward the end of World War I. White families occupied the street's northern blocks while African-American families owned homes toward the road's southern and unpaved end. Proliferation of the automobile in the 1930s and 1940s led a number of white families to purchase more modern residences in the suburbs and sell or rent their city houses. This migration continued for several decades and enabled African-Americans to purchase or rent some of the larger and more architecturally significant houses on Ridge Street. According to several long-time neighborhood residents, however, the decreased number of whites also led the city to ignore its responsibility to the area and services began to decline. After years of neglect by the City, municipal interest in the Ridge Street neighborhood was resurrected in the 1970s and 1980s as a result of the foundation of the Charlottesville House Improvement Program (CHIP).

Since the Kennedy administration, the assistant to the president for national security affairs (a.k.a.

Some national security advisers have balanced these roles adroitly. Others have not, generating discord within the president's senior advisory team. "

South African Institute of Race Relations Oral History Project;Johannesburg, South Africa. 1982 the oral history project of the South African Institute of Race Relations (SAIRR) was established with three full time members of staff and a part time secretary. Two types of oral evidence were collected. The first of these were interviews with individuals who had been involved in political and labour organisations which formed part of the movement of resistance to the South African government in the 1940s and 1950s. These interviews were not grouped or organised around specific themes, and interviewers were randomly selected. The interviews were done to record and preserve the testimony of activists from a range of organisations. This type of interview was categorised as archival. The second category of interviews was organised around more specific themes. Evidence was collected from groups of people involved in a particular event or doing the same kind of work. A common aim of this project was to make the testimony collected available to a wider audience. This finally took the form of booklets, designed to be accessible to a wide range of people.

In 1975, the first wave of 4,600 Cambodian immigrants arrived.

Built in 1923, Stephens-Lee was for many decades western North Carolina's only secondary school for African Americans. The school drew students from Buncombe, Henderson, Madison, Yancey, and Transylvania counties, and represented a focal point and a key source of pride for the extended African American community in the state's western region. In 1965, however, the all-white school board closed Stephens-Lee as part of its desegregation plan, and, in 1975, the entire multi-building campus, except for the gymnasium, was bulldozed.

Students During the Fall of the Communist Regime: Biographical Interviews;Prague, Czech Republic. The methods of oral history have rarely been used in Czech historiography (with the notable exception of Ilona Christl and Kveta Jechova's research of Charter 77). Consequently, the first work in the Czech Republic based on oral history is the project ‚ÄúStudents during the Fall of the Communist R√©gime - Biographical Interviews‚Äù. The project was funded by the Grant Agency of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic. Dr. Miroslav Vanek lead the project and was assisted by Dr. Milan Otahal. The result of the project was a 860 page book, ‚ÄúSto studentskych revoluci‚Äù or ‚ÄúA hundred student revolutions,‚Äù written by Dr. Vanek and Dr. Otahal. This work, published in 1999, has received a great response and has demonstrated the importance and correctness of oral history methods in researching recent Czech history. The employment of these methods has above all, enabled historians to expand the subject to include everyday life.

Teton Dam Disaster;Logan, Utah, United States. On June 5, 1976, the newly constructed Teton Dam in southeastern Idaho collapsed.

Women and Timber: The Pacific Northwest Logging Community, 1920-1998;Vancouver, Washington, United States. his project pursued the forgotten histories of the mothers, wives, sisters, and daughters of Pacific Northwest loggers from 1920 to 1997, primarily through oral history interviews. A dangerous, labor-intensive, and male-dominated occupation, logging was, until very recently, central to the Pacific Northwest's extractive-based economy and to what historian Carlos Schwantes, in his introduction to The Pacific Northwest, An Interpretive History, has criticized as a regional history limited by its preoccupation with heroic men engaged in heroic battles to tame or subdue nature. Consistent with Schwantes' characterization of Pacific Northwest historiography, most historical studies about logging focus on the logistics and lore of the logger and his occupation. Few scholars have turned their attention to the experiences of women affiliated with loggers through kinship and marriage. This project explores womens' roles as key participants in the development and maintenance of the logging community and culture that has, in many ways, helped define Pacific Northwest history.

Women's History: Asian American Women's Movement Activists;Long Beach, California, United States. Although not widely known outside the Asian community or among feminist activists and scholars outside of the Los Angeles area, there was a thriving, militant Asian American women's movement in southern California starting in the late 1960s/early 1970s. Like other movements among feminists of color, it both grew out of and remained tied to the larger national/ethnic movement and the anti-war movement. 
Women's History: Chicana Feminists;"Long Beach, California, United States. Chicana feminists in Southern California engaged in a range of groups and activities, both on college campuses and in their communities - often both. Regardless of the specifics of their politics or focus, most were initially politicized in the Chicano movement of the late 1960s; and most developed their feminist consciousness as a result of their direct experience with sexism in that movement. "
Women's History: Feminist Health Movement;"Long Beach, California, United States. From its earliest days in the 1960s, the women‚Äôs liberation movement focused on abortion and women‚Äôs right to control their bodies. Some of the more radical groups engaged in underground abortion clinics, most notably in Chicago; others, like the Boston‚Äôs Women‚Äôs Health Collective began writing/publishing projects; and organizations like NOW formed Task Forces to work on the issue of reproductive rights. "
Women's History: Los Angeles Feminists;Long Beach, California, United States. While some 1960s/1970s women‚Äôs movements in Los Angeles were inextricably linked to ethnic or national communities and movements, many White Anglo women from different communities came together to participate in groups that, taken together, was often referred to as ‚Äúthe women‚Äôs liberation movement.‚Äù These groups ranged from chapters of a national organization like NOW - usually characterized as a liberal feminist group - to smaller radical groups of anarcha-feminists, lesbian feminists and radical feminists. In Los Angeles, many of these groups were spawned at the Crenshaw Women‚Äôs Center (CWC), where NOW also participated initially. After the center closed in 1972, many of these groups operated out of the Westside Women‚Äôs Center (WWC), where Sister monthly newspaper continued to be published. 
Women's History: Professionals and Entrepreneurs (Early Twentieth Century);"Long Beach, California, United States. By the early 20th century, women increasingly were entering into a variety of professions, including law, medicine and journalism although teaching and nursing still provided the most common options available to them. Although they had entered medicine in the 19th century, two hundred years later they still faced discriminatory practices both in medical school and in their professional organizations; and if they became journalists, they were less likely to follow in the footsteps of Nellie Bly and more likely be assigned to the columns specifically designed for the woman reader. On the other hand, they had more latitude in the new helping profession of social work, both because it was dominated by women and was seen largely as a legitimate extension of their social housekeeping role. "
Women's History: Reformers and Radicals (Early Twentieth Century);"Long Beach, California, United States. Historically, women's reform and radical activities have taken various forms. Some women worked in organizations that specifically focused on the position of women in society, such as the fight for woman suffrage (see Suffragist Series) while others worked in organizations like the National Council of Negro Women, which organized more generally for the ""uplift of the race."" Many other women worked for social change through clubs, churches, political groups, and organizations like the YWCA. "
Women's History: Rosie the Riveter Revisited;"Long Beach, California, United States. The Rosie the Riveter Revisited project, funded by NEH Grant (RC 00019-80-1459) and Rockefeller Foundation Grant (GA HUM 7924 and 8139) grants, was designed to do just that, using the medium of oral history. A total of forty-four Los Angeles production workers and two Women's Counselors were interviewed for the project; their numbers drawn from some 250 women with whom initial phone interviews were conducted. In life histories that averaged six hours, we traced what their prewar lives were like, their experiences during the war years, and the meaning and impact of their war work experience on their lives. Most the narrators worked in production jobs at Douglas, North American and Lockheed Aircraft; and their numbers include nine Mexicanas/Latinas and six African Americans. Additional interviews were conducted to better understand both aircraft manufacturing and the role of the Black community in creating wartime job opportunities. Arch Wallen's interview on the former topic is included in this series, while the interviews with Clayton Russell and Herbert Ward can be found in the series on Desegregating Unions during WWII. "
Women's History: Suffragists;Long Beach, California, United States. With the ratification of the 19th amendment in August, 1920, woman's suffrage was granted to most women in the United States. This marked the culmination of a long organized struggle that began at the Seneca Falls Convention in 1848. For the next seventy two years, women participated in a host of organizations and engaged in a range of activities to gain the right to vote. Some, like the General Federation of Women's Clubs with its three million members, were highly respectable mass organizations comprised mainly of older, married women. Others, like the Women's Political Union, which was modeled after its British counterpart, were more militant and smaller, and its members were generally younger. Although most of the suffrage organizations were composed mainly of White women, African American women also participated in the suffrage struggle, mainly in their own clubs and organizations. 
Women's History: Welfare Mothers, Welfare Rights;Long Beach, California, United States. The welfare mothers movement in Los Angeles can be traced to 1963 and the founding of the ANC Mothers Anonymous of Watts. Initially it had little connection with the larger women's movement, and its members did not view themselves as part of that movement. 
Women's History: Women's Lives, Women's Work, 1900-1960;"Long Beach, California, United States. This series is comprised of a range of women whose work and lives are not easily classified. With only one exception, they constitute a cohort born in the period from 1885 to 1900, and although they all eventually ended up in southern California, their work, family and community lives often played out elsewhere. Like women of that era, some worked outside their homes only rarely after they married and their lives revolved mainly around their families; others worked in various jobs to support themselves and their families. By and large, work was a necessity for them, not a choice, and the jobs available to them were limited. Like most working class women of their generation, they rarely had the education, skills or resources to exercise many options. "

Working in Paterson: Occupational Heritage in an Urban Setting presents 470 interview excerpts and 3882 photographs from the Working in Paterson Folklife Project of the American Folklife Center at the Library of Congress. The four-month study of occupational culture in Paterson, New Jersey, was conducted in 1994. Paterson is considered to be the cradle of the Industrial Revolution in America. It was founded in 1791 by the Society for Establishing Useful Manufactures (S.U.M.), a group that had U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton as an advocate. The basis for Paterson's manufacturing potential was the Great Falls on the Passaic River. Paterson went on to become the largest silk manufacturing center in the nation as well as a leader in the manufacture of many other products, from railroad locomotives to firearms. The documentary materials presented in this online collection explore how this industrial heritage expresses itself in Paterson today: in its work sites, work processes, and memories of workers. The online presentation also includes interpretive essays exploring such topics as work in the African-American community, a distinctive food tradition (the Hot Texas Wiener), the ethnography of a single work place (Watson Machine International), business life along a single street in Paterson (21st Avenue), and narratives told by retired workers.

    "# Week 4 - Counting Words & Phrases\n",
    "\n",
    "This week, we take text corpora that we have developed, spidered, scraped, and encoded, and we find and count words, simple and parsed phrases and explore the statistical properties of those counts (e.g., word frequency distributions). Initially, we model how to search corpora for keywords or phrases. Next, we examine the distributions of terms and phrases across a corpus, and the correlation between different words and phrase counts. In order to do this effectively, we coarsely disambiguate words based of part-of-speech (POS) tagging, and normalize them through stemming and lemmatization. Next we distinguish *important* words and phrase within the corpus, and image them with Wordls! Then we calculate word frequenceis, conditional frequences (the frequency of word *shock* conditional on the presence of word *awe*), and statistically significant collocations of lengths 2 through $n$. Finally, we calculate and visualize Differences (Divergences and Distances) between the word frequency distributions from two corpora. \n",
    "\n",
    "Then we shift to focus not simply on the *ideas* in a corpus, but also extracting precise *claims*. This process involves a sequential pipeline of classifying and structuring tokens from text, each of which generates potentially useful data for the content analyst. Steps in this process, which we examine in this notebook, include: 1) tagging words by their part of speech (POS) to reveal the linguistic role they play in the sentence (e.g., Verb, Noun, Adjective, etc.); 2) tagging words as named entities (NER) such as places or organizations; 3) structuring or \"parsing\" sentences into nested phrases that are local to, describe or depend on one another; and 4) extracting informational claims from those phrases.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be introducing spaCy as a package for Computational Linguistics, and also walk you through how to use the Davies Corpora. \n",
    "\n",
    "While we wish to avoid using NLTK for heavy corpus analysis, some of its smaller functions can still be useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, for final projects that draw on these tools, we encourage you to install the software on your own machines or shared servers at the university (RCC, SSRC) in order to perform these operations on much more text. \n",
    "\n",
    "For this notebook we will be using the following packages"

    "This shows that likelihood of a word occurring is inversely proportional to its rank. This effect is called [Zipf's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipf%27s_law), and suggests that the most frequent word will occur approximately twice as often as the second most frequent word, three times as often as the third most frequent word, etc. Zipf's law is most easily observed by plotting the data on a log-log graph, with the axes being log (rank order) and log (frequency) resulting in a linear relationship."

      "SEN. WHITEHOUSE SHARES WESTERLY GIRL'S STORY IN PUSH FOR STEM CELL RESEARCH\n",
      "  Sharing the story of Lila Barber, a 12 year old girl from Westerly, Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) on Tuesday, April 10, 2007, illustrated the hope stem cell research can offer in a speech on the Senate floor in favor of legislation to expand federal funding for stem cell research.  \n",
      "   Whitehouse met Lila two weeks ago. She was diagnosed two years ago with osteosarcoma, a cancerous bone condition, and last year underwent cadaver bone transplant surgery. The procedure saved her leg and is helping her remain cancer-free, but the transplanted tissue will not grow with her and likely will break down over time. Stem cell research, Whitehouse explained, could vastly improve the care of patients like Lila by allowing surgeons to enhance transplants with a patient's own stem cells, which could replace the lost bone and cartilage, or grow entirely new replacement bones and joints. \n",

After the Day of Infamy: \"Man-on-the-Street\" Interviews Following the Attack on Pearl Harbor presents approximately twelve hours of opinions recorded in the days and months following the bombing of Pearl Harbor from more than two hundred individuals in cities and towns across the United States. On December 8, 1941 (the day after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor), Alan Lomax, then \"assistant in charge\" of the Archive of American Folk Song (now the Archive of Folk Culture, American Folklife Center), sent a telegram to fieldworkers in ten different localities across the United States, asking them to collect \"man-on-the-street\" reactions of ordinary Americans to the bombing of Pearl Harbor and the subsequent declaration of war by the United States. A second series of interviews, called \"Dear Mr. President,\" was recorded in January and February 1942. Both collections are included in this presentation. They feature a wide diversity of opinion concerning the war and other social and political issues of the day, such as racial prejudice and labor disputes.

In 1967 two white sociologists, Gerald Schaflander and Henry Etzkowitz, and their students joined with black residents of Brooklyn's Bedford-Stuyvesant section to build an inter-racial neighborhood Co-op. The Bedford-Stuyvesant Community Cooperative offered generic medicines, foodstuffs, and other goods at discounted prices, and reinvested the profits back into the neighborhood to support a range of social services, child care, medical care, and educational support, for example. By 1968 the Co-op operated a parking lot, a gas station, a general store, a pharmacy, and a child care center. In the minds of its founders the Co-op stood as a rebuke to both the growing racialism of black nationalism and a testament against the unchecked immorality of American capitalism. The audiotapes comprising this collection capture numerous board, staff, and community meetings as well as interviews with the founders, directors, and committee members. The tapes reveal the struggles and conflicts of establishing and maintaining the Co-op, including discussions on hirings, firings, division of labor, finances, and neighborhood violence. [View Collection Details] [View Repository Details]\n",

      "Behind the Veil Oral History Project Collection  Durham, North Carolina, United States. For three consecutive summers beginning in 1993, researchers from the Behind the Veil project at the Center for Documentary Studies fanned out across the south collecting oral histories from African Americans elders who lived and worked during the period of legal segregation. The researchers' goal was to create a documentary base for understanding the history of African American life in the Jim Crow South. The archive resulting from their efforts contains more than 1,200 taped interviews recorded in North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia, Kentucky, Arkansas, Louisiana, Tennessee, Alabama, and Florida. The interviews were structured as life histories and as such, each covers a wide range of topics. Nevertheless, groups of interviews often unite thematically across a region, and some basic issues relating to community life, politics, race-relations, and religion emerge across the collection as a whole. The life of mine workers, for example, figures prominently in interviews completed in Kentucky and Birmingham, Alabama; the impact of black educational institutions stands out in interviews conducted in Enfield, North Carolina; and the ambiguities of segregation at work in the ethnic montage that is Louisiana reveal themselves in interviews made in New Orleans. Overall the collection offers rich information on such topics as labor, religious life, survival strategies, migration patterns, family life, childhood, education, recreation, business, civil rights and politics.

Each interview explores the \"trauma\" story, beginning in Cambodia and continuing through immigration to the United States, the impact of the interviewee’s experiences, both political and personal, on her life; changes in gender-related roles after her arrival in the United States, and the significance of Buddhism in her ability to cope with her trauma and new life. Summary : Collection consists of minutes, correspondence, reports, and printed materials about the project and Cambodian refugee camps.

During WWII African Americans demonstrated the spirit and personal heroism that would again be drawn upon in the 1960s to save America from the grip of racial injustice. African Americans associated with Camp Evans became Ph.Ds, accomplished engineers, decorated officers and respected managers. As example, Dr. Walter McAfee would help open the space age, but sadly his part would not be mentioned until later. [View Collection Details] [View Repository Details]\n",

      "Cayman Islands Memory Bank  Georgetown, Grand Cayman, Cayman Islands, Cayman Islands. While these changes brought much that was good, including economic prosperity, they also brought problems. One of these was the threat to our culture, as our traditions were swamped in a flood of movies, television, newspapers, etc. from abroad, primarily the U.S., and the influence of so many non-Caymanians, from much older cultures than our own, in the society. Faced with these influences, the old ways began to be forgotten and, indeed, in the minds of some, grew the idea that Cayman did not have a culture of its own, which in turn led to a sort of cultural inferiority complex. In the early 1980's, many Caymanians became very concerned about all of this and work began which eventually resulted in the establishment of the National Cultural Foundation, National Museum, National Trust and National Archive. As part of this initiative, a group of concerned young adults began interviewing older Caymanians on audio tape in order to document the old traditions and way of life. This developed into the Memory Bank, which eventually was recognized by the Government as very important and made part of the National Archive in 1991.

Unfortunately the nature of the DLP's contribution is generally misunderstood, as were the circumstances that gave rise to the party and what its actual purpose was. Far from being the anti-union and narrow-minded reactionary party that it has been unfairly caricatured as, the DLP in fact operated according to social democratic principles which enabled it to make a positive and constructive contribution to Australian public policy in the period of its existence between 1955 and 1978. The DLP's historic roots went back to the Labor Party and the Australian union movement and the party's viability in part depended upon the principled support and commitment that it received from its membership. [View Collection Details] [View Repository Details]\n",

      "Few Good Women: Advancing the Cause for Women in Government  University Park, Pennsylvania, United States. In 1969, President Richard Nixon created the Task Force on Women's Rights and Responsibilities that marked the beginning of a successful initiative to recruit and train women for upper-level governmental positions. Unfortunately, few of the women who joined the government as a result of this initiative left collections of papers for historians to review in the future. Many of the women are nearing retirement age or have retired; a few have died. Preserving the memories and reflections of these women on their careers in government service is a timely project. Their recollections, along with those of the men who were involved in the effort, will make a significant contribution to the documentation of the history of women in modern American political life. [View Collection Details] [View Repository Details]\n",

Under the auspices of the War Relocation Authority, the Selective Service required both groups to answer a questionnaire that, among other things, questioned their willingness to serve in the U.S. military and their willingness to repudiate their allegiance to Japan. One group of Japanese American resisters became known as the \"No-No Boys\" because they answered negatively to both these questions. The people interviewed in these tapes were directly or indirectly affected by these events and they offer a variety of perspectives on their significance. During World War II, roughly 110,000 Japanese Americans were imprisoned in U.S. government-run camps known as relocation centers. Other Japanese Americans willingly served in the U.S. military during World War II. [View Collection Details] [View Repository Details]\n",

Author and music historian Frank Driggs recently gave his collection of oral histories to the Marr Sound Archives, a division of Special Collections in the Miller Nichols Library at the University of Missouri-Kansas City. The oral histories, conducted from 1956 to 1986, capture the truths of the development of jazz as related by a host of musicians and band leaders who defined the tradition. All aspects of the jazz experience are captured in the interviews, ranging from musical triumphs to hardships on the road during the Great Depression. Reflecting Driggs' interest in the development of Southwestern and Kansas City jazz, the collection is rich in oral histories of the bandleaders and musicians who defined those traditions, including Andy Kirk, Buster Smith, Gene Ramey, Thamon Hayes, Jesse Stone and Ed Lewis. Many of the oral histories in the Driggs collection survive as the only known record of a musician's experiences and voice. [View Collection Details] [View Repository Details]\n",

The complete \"From Porch Swings to Patios: Oral History Project\" included interviews taken from white and black residents in Charlottesville which covered changes from 1914 through 1984 in fourteen different neighborhoods. The recordings and transcripts of interviews presented here, however, are only those of African Americans. Although black residents occupied several different neighborhoods within the city limits from the mid-nineteenth century on, the people interviewed for \"Porch Swings\" and represented on this site came from the Vinegar Hill area. Vinegar Hill encompassed a section of West Main street that began at downtown Charlottesville and extended west toward the campus of the University of Virginia. The area was composed mostly of businesses owned by Charlottesville's black citizens, and though the stores catered to the black population, they served both black and white clientele. In the early 1960s, Charlottesville's city officials designated Vinegar Hill as a blighted area in need of an overhaul. Following a national trend, a sweeping \"urban renewal\" project was carried out that ostensibly removed decrepit buildings and cleared unsightly landscape for improved sanitation and overall appearance. In these interviews, former Vinegar Hill residents share their thoughts on the extent to which those promises for improvement were fulfilled or not. [View Collection Details] [View Repository Details] [16 interview(s) listed in this collection]\n",

Local midwives with no professional training delivered virtually all babies in these rural communities until 1925, when Mary Breckinridge organized the first effort to supply trained nurse- midwives and doctors to mountain people in remote areas. Until this time, most medical treatment was limited to the skills of persons with knowledge of herb and folk remedies. The FNS combined midwifery and family nursing with preventive health care, and in a few years vastly improved the general state of health in the region. [View Collection Details] [View Repository Details] [14 interview(s) listed in this collection]\n",

Two bound copies were placed in the Vinton Public Library and are available on inter-library loan. A slide-tape show was produced based on these interviews and is also available at the Vinton library. All of the women, who were born at the turn of the twentieth century, were asked questions about family background, education, work history, personal memories and historical events. Their stories reveal ten individuals of varying backgrounds and experiences, yet who are typical of women on farms and in small towns of the Midwest.

From its inception, the National Security Council has addressed economic issues: two of its first four meetings, held in 1947, focused on exports to the USSR. But while trade and finance have been key components of U.S. foreign policy, they also have had substantial impact on citizen welfare at home. This impact has increased with the growing internationalization of the U.S. economy. Hence, from the early 1970s, NSC jurisdiction over international economic matters has been challenged by individuals and institutions concerned with domestic economic policy. In the Clinton administration, this was manifested by the creation of the National Economic Council paralleling the NSC, and by the coordination of international economic policy through a combined staff reporting to the national security adviser and the national economic adviser. [View Collection Details] [View Repository Details] [16 interview(s) listed in this collection]\n",

Its production helped Long Beach recover from the Depression and provided revenue to support expansion and modernization of the harbor as well as enriching individuals who owned land in the area. As a result when land near the oil field began to sink, those who were profiting from pumping the oil out from under the land resisted any suggestion that there could be a link between oil production and subsidence. They hired experts to defend their position. As the subsidence continued, those whose property was damaged by the sinking, but who were not benefiting from the oil production, hired experts to determine what was really causing the sinking. [View Collection Details] [View Repository Details] [4 interview(s) listed in this collection]\n",

      "Long Beach Area History: Signal Hill  Long Beach, California, United States. Oil was discovered on Signal Hill, north of the City of Long Beach, in 1921. Soon more wells were brought it and the field spread into the City. As more people moved into the area to work on the wells and the developments that followed them, people in pre-existing neighborhoods worried that the field's spread might bring out of control wells, smelly sump holes and dangerous equipment near their homes. In response, Long Beach adopted regulations that limited oil development. Even as the City incorporated outlying neighborhoods that filled with the homes of oil workers and those in related industries, people on top of the hill, near the center of petroleum development, resisted. And in 1926 they incorporated their own City of Signal Hill which is completely surrounded by the City of Long Beach. [View Collection Details] [View Repository Details] [11 interview(s) listed in this collection]\n",

The purpose of this oral history project, conducted by Roma Kempe, was to determine how the families of Albuquerque's St. Paul Lutheran Church have struggled to preserve their culture. The families are descendants of Norwegian, Swedish, German, Danish, and Finnish cultures who, during the earlier part of the twentieth century, were all members of the Lutheran Church. A problem arose in the church over what language the sermons and prayers should be conducted in. The Church wanted to \"assimilate\" the different ethnic groups and provide English services because many of the children did not understand the languages of their parents. As a result, language and culture began to be over-taken by the new American culture. Many churches tried to maintain their ethnicity, but during World War I, legislation was passed prohibiting the public use of foreign languages, especially German. This further limited the Church members' ability to maintain their ethnic traditions. [View Collection Details] [View Repository Details]\n",

The Black civil right movement, opposition to the war in Vietnam, student protests for more relevant classes, farm workers organizing unions, New Mexican farmers asserting ownership of public land, hippies advocating love were among the agents of change.

Drawing on the example of earlier Mexican American activists, such as those who organized to secure justice for the young men accused of the Sleepy Lagoon murders, or elected Edward Roybal to the Los Angeles City Council, they began to organize among themselves. [View Collection Details] [View Repository Details] [5 interview(s) listed in this collection]\n",

      "Musical Development in Southern California: Jazz Composers, Arrangers and Performers  Long Beach, California, United States. The Hollywood film and recording studios served as a magnet, attracting many talented jazz and commercial musicians to Los Angeles. Yet, little is known of the role that Los Angeles played in the development of jazz, especially the early extension of New Orleans, Chicago and Kansas City jazz. For example, Paul Whiteman's first major success came with his appearance at the Alexandria Hotel in downtown Los Angeles in 1919, and in the early 1920s, nearly every major New Orleans figure who went to Chicago also appeared in Los Angeles. By the 1930s, Louis Armstrong was in Los Angeles (1931-32) making records, and Benny Goodman and his band appeared here in 1935 in an event that several jazz historians mark as the beginning of the popularity of the swing era. Lionel Hampton had been in Los Angeles since 1925, the year that radio station KFI did the first Los Angeles to New York radio broadcast. [View Collection Details] [View Repository Details] [4 interview(s) listed in this collection]\n",

      "Norfolk Museums and Archaeology Service Oral History Collection  Norfolk, England, United Kingdom. For the museums service reminiscence work is a two-way process. The memories of everyday life are invaluable sources of information which help us to more truthfully reflect social history in exhibitions. When taped and broadcast alongside museum objects or used in other ways to aid interpretation, they provide a fascinating insight into the history of an era or a place. Collecting oral history also enables us to involve people in museum activities, through their contribution to exhibition and education programmes. An example of such work is the Great Yarmouth Museums millennium collecting project, designed to produce a snapshot of everyday life in the Borough during 2000. Community groups and business organisations have been invited to fill a cardboard box with material representative of everyday life and associated oral \"history\" has been recorded. As completed boxes arrive back at the museum offices they will be displayed in the foyer at the library. This will be updated monthly and the whole project will culminate in 2001 with a touring exhibition of all the collected material. As well as providing the museums with new collections it is hoped this project will encourage a greater sense of ownership from Borough residents towards their museums. In general, oral history collection often means the museum is donated objects and photographs, builds new audiences and supporters and helps us to achieve a positive profile in the older community. [View Collection Details] [View Repository Details]\n",

It became apparent to Sargeant and Davis that the local people had a wealth of historical information in their memories that needed to be documented. Thus, in 1983, the North Valley Oral History Project was born with three main goals: to present a picture of life in the North Valley before its transition from a rural to a suburban community, to record oral histories for present and future populations of the North Valley, and to create a body of primary source material about the North Valley for scholarly research. [View Collection Details] [View Repository Details]\n",

The main focus of the interviews will center on the period of resettlement between 1942-1965. This \"resettlement\" era is critical to understanding the full impact of the exclusion and incarceration experience, yet it has been the subject of relatively little scholarly inquiry. Though the end of war brought \"freedom\" from the confines of America's concentration camps, Japanese Americans returned to the same prejudice and discrimination they had left in 1942. Naturalization laws, alien lands laws, \"anti-miscegenation\" laws, housing restrictions, and immigration laws continued to exclude Japanese Americans from taking their rightful place in American society. REgenerations will explore the struggle of Japanese Americans to overcome these institutional and social barriers and restore their family and community life which had been fragmented by the wartime experience.

      "Ridge Street Oral Histories  Charlottesville, Virginia, United States. In 1981, the Ridge Street Historic District was placed on the Virginia Landmarks Register and the National Register of Historic Places because of its role as one of Charlottesville's architecturally significant late-nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century residential areas. The first residences in the Ridge Street Neighborhood were built around 1840, and construction continued into the twentieth century, eventually subsiding toward the end of World War I. White families occupied the street's northern blocks while African-American families owned homes toward the road's southern and unpaved end. Proliferation of the automobile in the 1930s and 1940s led a number of white families to purchase more modern residences in the suburbs and sell or rent their city houses. This migration continued for several decades and enabled African-Americans to purchase or rent some of the larger and more architecturally significant houses on Ridge Street. According to several long-time neighborhood residents, however, the decreased number of whites also led the city to ignore its responsibility to the area and services began to decline. After years of neglect by the City, municipal interest in the Ridge Street neighborhood was resurrected in the 1970s and 1980s as a result of the foundation of the Charlottesville House Improvement Program (CHIP). [View Collection Details] [View Repository Details] [15 interview(s) listed in this collection]\n",

Presidents clearly want both, but the roles are in tension. Specifically, an assistant who pushes his own views too strongly risks losing the trust of a secretary of state (or defense) who has a different opinion. Some national security advisers have balanced these roles adroitly.

Two types of oral evidence were collected. The first of these were interviews with individuals who had been involved in political and labour organisations which formed part of the movement of resistance to the South African government in the 1940s and 1950s. These interviews were not grouped or organised around specific themes, and interviewers were randomly selected. The interviews were done to record and preserve the testimony of activists from a range of organisations. This type of interview was categorised as archival. The second category of interviews was organised around more specific themes. Evidence was collected from groups of people involved in a particular event or doing the same kind of work. A common aim of this project was to make the testimony collected available to a wider audience. This finally took the form of booklets, designed to be accessible to a wide range of people. [View Collection Details] [View Repository Details]\n",

This was the Institute's first such attempt with American immigrants of Asian heritage and a pilot project for a larger undertaking in the mid-Atlantic states, which would cover later immigrants, second-generation South Asian Americans, and less-visible communities, such as gays and lesbians. Eric Pumroy, director of the Balch Library, won a ten-week grant from the Samuel Fels Fund, which led to the appointment of Sufia Uddin as graduate intern for the project. Rani Sinha, volunteer coordinator, wrote the questionnaire, drawing on the humanistic impulses of the Federal Writers' Project, directed by Benjamin Botkin from 1936 to 1940. Uddin had primary responsibility for finding and interviewing individuals who had arrived in the U.S. as adults before 1975 from a wide representation of South Asian sociocultural backgrounds, as well as a variety of American socioeconomic backgrounds. [View Collection Details] [View Repository Details]\n",

The interviews examine both the process of desegregation and the effects it had on individuals, on race relations, and on the community as a whole. Unlike many southern communities, in which desegregation was largely thwarted by large-scale white flight to private institutions or suburban school districts, the combined Charlotte-Mecklenburg County school district managed to achieve a relatively stable racial and economic balance within its schools, chiefly because of an ambitious busing program. [View Collection Details] [View Repository Details]\n",

Interviews by Kelly Navies explore the history of Stephens-Lee High School in Asheville, N.C. Built in 1923, Stephens-Lee was for many decades western North Carolina's only secondary school for African Americans. The school drew students from Buncombe, Henderson, Madison, Yancey, and Transylvania counties, and represented a focal point and a key source of pride for the extended African American community in the state's western region. In 1965, however, the all-white school board closed Stephens-Lee as part of its desegregation plan, and, in 1975, the entire multi-building campus, except for the gymnasium, was bulldozed. Navies interviewed former faculty, administrators, and students of Stephens-Lee to collect memories of the school and to assess the impact of desegregation and the school's closing on the black community in western North Carolina. [View Collection Details] [View Repository Details]\n",

      "Students During the Fall of the Communist Regime: Biographical Interviews  Prague, Czech Republic. The methods of oral history have rarely been used in Czech historiography (with the notable exception of Ilona Christl and Kveta Jechova's research of Charter 77). Consequently, the first work in the Czech Republic based on oral history is the project “Students during the Fall of the Communist Régime - Biographical Interviews”. The project was funded by the Grant Agency of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic. Dr. Miroslav Vanek lead the project and was assisted by Dr. Milan Otahal. The result of the project was a 860 page book, “Sto studentskych revoluci” or “A hundred student revolutions,” written by Dr. Vanek and Dr. Otahal. This work, published in 1999, has received a great response and has demonstrated the importance and correctness of oral history methods in researching recent Czech history. The employment of these methods has above all, enabled historians to expand the subject to include everyday life. [View Collection Details] [View Repository Details]\n",

They were often farm labourers or workers in allied rural occupations, or wives of labourers. Speakers were encouraged to use their most natural form of speech and the interviews were unscripted, unrehearsed and unprepared.

The idea of an oral history first surfaced in 1970 when the Township was celebrating the seventy-fifth anniversary of its incorporation in 1895. Some 100 interviews were taped by volunteers. The expenses were underwritten by private contributions. After the National Endowment for the Humanities awarded a grant in 1980 for the project to be completed, the funds were used to tape another 100 interviews and to produce a half-hour film, a companion audio-visual presentation, a photographic display of the Township's early days and this booklet. The oral history dramatizes how a community of people with a wide diversity of ethnic, religious and racial backgrounds is capable of working together to absorb major social changes and to create a community which exemplifies unity without uniformity. The oral history, now a permanent part of the Teaneck Public Library collection, is available in whole or in part for loan to community organizations, schools and libraries. [View Collection Details] [View Repository Details] [79 interview(s) listed in this collection]\n",

      "Teton Dam Disaster  Logan, Utah, United States. On June 5, 1976, the newly constructed Teton Dam in southeastern Idaho collapsed. Water contained in its filling reservoir surged through the Upper Snake River Valley, inundating whole communities, blanketing farm lands with debris, and disrupting the lives of thousands. In its wake, the flood's damages totaled hundreds of millions of dollars. But in addition to property losses were the personal losses for which there was no reparation. To better understand this loss, a program to gather and preserve personal accounts of the disaster was jointly undertaken by the Department of History and Geography of Utah State University, Ricks College and the Idaho State Historical Society. The oral histories obtained by these agencies provide recollections of the flood and its aftermath from the perspectives of individuals, families and communities. One hundred and twenty-four (124) interviews were completed and are now available for historical and scholarly research in the Department of Special Collections and Archives at Utah State University. [View Collection Details] [View Repository Details]\n",

The U.S.-Japan Project initiated an oral history program to conduct interviews with former Japanese and American officials who were closely involved with the management of relations between the two countries since 1960. The impetus for the program came from the Project's Advisory Panel, which in its initial meetings identified the need for such a program, in light of the lack of declassified official documents in Japan. Though Japan has recently passed a Freedom of Information Act, its impact upon scholarly access to significant Japanese official records remains to be determined, leaving such interviews a critical source of information on the making of foreign, defense and economic policies within the Japanese government. The U.S.-Japan Project's Oral History Program was headed in Japan by Professors Makoto Iokibe of Kobe University (a member of the Project Advisory Panel) and Koji Murata, formerly at Hiroshima University and currently at Doshisha University (a Project Research Fellow), who worked with other scholars associated with the project to conduct these interviews and prepare the original transcripts. [View Collection Details] [View Repository Details] [19 interview(s) listed in this collection]\n",

Involved in all aspects of the project, their students did background research, conducted, transcribed and indexed the interviews with key figures, and wrote \"Giving Shelter,\" the history of the Baton Rouge Chapter of VOA. [View Collection Details] [View Repository Details]\n",

      "Women and Timber: The Pacific Northwest Logging Community, 1920-1998  Vancouver, Washington, United States. his project pursued the forgotten histories of the mothers, wives, sisters, and daughters of Pacific Northwest loggers from 1920 to 1997, primarily through oral history interviews. A dangerous, labor-intensive, and male-dominated occupation, logging was, until very recently, central to the Pacific Northwest's extractive-based economy and to what historian Carlos Schwantes, in his introduction to The Pacific Northwest, An Interpretive History, has criticized as a regional history limited by its preoccupation with heroic men engaged in heroic battles to tame or subdue nature. Consistent with Schwantes' characterization of Pacific Northwest historiography, most historical studies about logging focus on the logistics and lore of the logger and his occupation. Few scholars have turned their attention to the experiences of women affiliated with loggers through kinship and marriage. This project explores womens' roles as key participants in the development and maintenance of the logging community and culture that has, in many ways, helped define Pacific Northwest history. [View Collection Details] [View Repository Details] [14 interview(s) listed in this collection]\n",

In Los Angeles, many of these groups were spawned at the Crenshaw Women’s Center (CWC), where NOW also participated initially.

Although they had entered medicine in the 19th century, two hundred years later they still faced discriminatory practices both in medical school and in their professional organizations; and if they became journalists, they were less likely to follow in the footsteps of Nellie Bly and more likely be assigned to the columns specifically designed for the woman reader. On the other hand, they had more latitude in the new helping profession of social work, both because it was dominated by women and was seen largely as a legitimate extension of their social housekeeping role. [View Collection Details] [View Repository Details] [19 interview(s) listed in this collection]\n",

For the next seventy two years, women participated in a host of organizations and engaged in a range of activities to gain the right to vote. Some, like the General Federation of Women's Clubs with its three million members, were highly respectable mass organizations comprised mainly of older, married women. Others, like the Women's Political Union, which was modeled after its British counterpart, were more militant and smaller, and its members were generally younger.

      "Working in Paterson: Occupational Heritage in an Urban Setting  Washington, District of Columbia, United States. Working in Paterson: Occupational Heritage in an Urban Setting presents 470 interview excerpts and 3882 photographs from the Working in Paterson Folklife Project of the American Folklife Center at the Library of Congress. The four-month study of occupational culture in Paterson, New Jersey, was conducted in 1994. Paterson is considered to be the cradle of the Industrial Revolution in America. It was founded in 1791 by the Society for Establishing Useful Manufactures (S.U.M.), a group that had U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton as an advocate. The basis for Paterson's manufacturing potential was the Great Falls on the Passaic River. Paterson went on to become the largest silk manufacturing center in the nation as well as a leader in the manufacture of many other products, from railroad locomotives to firearms. The documentary materials presented in this online collection explore how this industrial heritage expresses itself in Paterson today: in its work sites, work processes, and memories of workers. The online presentation also includes interpretive essays exploring such topics as work in the African-American community, a distinctive food tradition (the Hot Texas Wiener), the ethnography of a single work place (Watson Machine International), business life along a single street in Paterson (21st Avenue), and narratives told by retired workers. [View Collection Details] [View Repository Details]\n",

I thought, here I am, immersed in history, and this history is slowly being lost. I also thought, what a great bunch of stories these veterans have to tell, they belong in a book.

Lemmatization can be thought of as finding the root or the base of the word after removing inflections and other variations of words. Another possible way of finding the roots of words is using NLTK's porting or stemming functionalities, but we will not be getting into them.\n",

The [`ConditionalFreqDist`](http://www.nltk.org/api/nltk.html#nltk.probability.ConditionalProbDist) class reads in an iterable of tuples, the first element is the condition and the second the focal word. For starters, we will use word lengths as the conditions, but tags or clusters will provide more useful results."

    "If we want to compare different corpora, we need a distance or divergence that compares the two distributions.\n",

    "### Kullback-Leibler and $x^2$ divergences ###\n",
    "\n",
    "KL and $\\chi^2$ divergences are members of the broader <a \"href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-divergence\" target=\"_blank\">$f$-divergence</a> family, a function of $D_f (P || Q)$ that calculates the difference between two probability distributions P and Q. The KL $f(t)$ is $ t \\text{ log } t $, while the $\\chi^2$ is $t^2-1$. KL comes from information and $\\chi^2$ from measure theory. As such, the KL divergence computes the relative entropy between two distributions--how they differ in bits, while the $\\chi^2$ whether the same statistical inferences can be drawn from them both.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, given two discrete probability distributions $P$ and $Q$, the Kullback-Leibler divergence from $Q$ to $P$ is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$D_{\\mathrm{KL}}(P\\|Q) = \\sum_i P(i) \\, \\log\\frac{P(i)}{Q(i)}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [scipy.stats.entropy()](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.entropy.html) function does the calculation for you, which takes in two arrays of probabilities and computes the KL divergence. Note that the KL divergence is in general not commutative, i.e. $D_{\\mathrm{KL}}(P\\|Q) \\neq D_{\\mathrm{KL}}(Q\\|P)$ .\n",
    "\n",
    "Also note that the KL divernce is the sum of elementwise divergences. Scipy provides [scipy.special.kl_div()](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.special.kl_div.html#scipy-special-kl-div) which calculates elementwise divergences for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "The $\\chi^2$ Divergence is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$D_{\\mathrm{\\chi^2}}(P\\|Q) = \\sum_i \\left(\\frac{P(i)}{Q(i)}-1\\right)^2$. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is also noncommutative, and the code can be drawn directly from scipy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Kolmogorov-Smirnov ###\n",
    "\n",
    "The two-sample Kolmogovorov-Smirnov test statistic calculates the distance between the cumulative distribution function of the two distributions to be compared, and, along with the $x^2$ divergence, is among the most common approaches two calculating a distance in statistics. It can be interpreted as a test of whether two distributions are drawn from the same underlying distribution. As with the others, the code is readily available in scipy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Wasserstein Distance ###\n",
    "\n",
    "When this is computed on a Euclidian metric structure (e.g., numbers of words), this is also known as the earth mover’s distance, because it can be seen as the minimum amount of \"work\" required to transform $P$ into $Q$, where \"work\" is measured as the amount of distribution weight that must be moved, multiplied by the distance it has to be moved.\n",

    "Now we will calculate the KL divergence for each pair of corpora, turn the results into a matrix, and visualize the matrix as a heatmap. Recall that $D_{\\mathrm{KL}}(P\\|Q)$ measures the amount of information loss when $Q$ is used to approximate $P$. Here, the rows are the $P$s used for calculating KL divergences, and the columns are the $Q$s. So, each cell measures the amount of information loss when the word distribution of the column text is used to approximate the word distribution of the row text. Because the KL divergence is directional, such that the divergence of $P$ from $Q$ is different from the same of $Q$ from $P$, the matrix is assymetric and contains unique information above and below the diagonal. The same is true for the $\\chi^2$ divergence."

Lichtenstein;I want to begin this year’s conversation with a discussion of the contemporary politics of collecting and display. Like many institutions today—the university, the curriculum, indeed this very journal—the “museum” faces pressure to decolonize its cultural practices and national ;0;161;;
Redman;These are critical questions for museums today. As a historian interested in the history of museums and a former museum professional, I have seen these matters play out in several different contexts. Museum history, as the question suggests, is intimately bound up with ;162;1033;;
Ho;The question “What would a ‘decolonized’ museum look like?” was present at the birth of China’s first native museum in 1905. In the nineteenth century, the only museums in China were institutions located in the foreign concessions of Shanghai, and early museum boosters were ;1034;2216;;
Conklin;In our answers so far. to the question “What would a ‘decolonized’ museum look like?,” a wide variety of institutions have been evoked: history museums, art museums, natural history museums, and ethnographic museums, and there are surely others. If we add different national ;2217;2915;;
Conn;I think we need to start with some definitions and some categories, a few caveats and qualifications. The Institute of Museum and Library Services counted more than 35,000 “active” museums in the United States.10 And that was in 2014. Those museums range across all kinds of ;2916;3704;;
Lichtenstein;Let me follow up by building on Steven Conn’s contrarian response to my first question. As he implies, first and foremost, museums display objects to the public, and academic discussions of display ignore this “public” at our peril. What makes the Museum of African American History and ;3705;3910;;
Ho;The issues of the object versus. the narrative, the making of the narrative (and for whom), and the curatorial tension between historical content and contemporary audience are critical considerations, both for museums and for those of us who study them. Before I address this second prompt, however, ;3911;4846;;
Kirshenblatt-Gimblett;Many thanks, Denise, for this post. I’d like to respond to a few points. First, objects and their display as a defining feature of museums. ICOM, the International Council of Museums, issued a call in December 2018 for a revised definition of museums to better reflect their current reality.14 No doubt ;4847;5931;;
Redman;What kinds of stories should museums tell? There is, of course, no single answer to this important question. but museums should explore what it means, and what it has meant historically, to be human. They should also help us understand our planet, the environment we should be better stewards for, ;5932;6860;;
Conn;The creation of narrative is among the things that distinguished the modern museum from the cabinets of curiosities and Wunderkammern that preceded them. Modern museums imposed order and system on collections—and in turn, they collected based on those systems—and they did so in order ;6861;7649;;
Conklin;In addressing the questions posed by Alex Lichtenstein in round two of our discussions. a basic difference has emerged between current museum practices in an authoritarian closed society such as China, and those in democratic and open ones (principally the U.S.). The dividing line has been the ;7650;9274;;
Araujo;There is no single answer to Alex’s question because there are too many kinds of museums. in so many different places, created to fulfill too many different purposes. As put by Steven Conn, the birth of the modern museum implies the existence of a collection or several collections of objects, artifacts, ;9275;9998;;
Kirshenblatt-Gimblett;Museums come in many forms, and they are more than their permanent or core exhibition and temporary exhibitions, though our discussion so far seems to conflate the two: museum and exhibition. One of the most contentious aspects of museums is their collections, whether formed in ;9999;11179;;
Lichtenstein;I have invited Barbara to initiate the next round of discussion. Hello Barbara.;11180;11191;;
Kirshenblatt-Gimblett; I have noticed an increasingly strong trend toward activism. Consider the International Council of Museums’ initiative to redefine museums and the definitions that are being proposed, which can be accessed at https://icom.museum/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/MDPP-report-and-recommendations- ;11192;11292;;
Ho;Throughout this conversation, I have been struck by the interplay among museum history, contemporary museum practice, and prescriptions for the future. This is evident in the two past questions—how might one rethink museum practice in light of its history, and what kinds of ;11293;11939;;
Kirshenblatt-Gimblett;Many thanks, Denise. This is just what was on my mind, thinking now of museums in Poland, where, under the current right-wing government, they are instruments of historical policy intended to shape civic and patriotic attitudes and defend Poland’s reputation. And not only museums, but also mass ;11940;13370;;
Lichtenstein;Not to add too much fuel to the fire here. but doesn’t the call to blunt museum “activism” run the danger of restoring the false idea that the museum can serve as a neutral, apolitical repository of history, culture, heritage, and national identity? Isn’t that conceit the very reason that scholars in a ;13371;13455;;
Conklin;I disagree with Steve. Although I know a lot less about contemporary museum practices than he does, I would argue that museums can and should be activists, but activism (like museums) can take many forms. Decolonizing the European ethnographic and natural history museum, either through ;13456;13934;;
Redman;This conversation is important, and I am glad we are having it. An undercurrent in this discussion is the assumption that museums were (or at least aspired to be) more neutral or objective in their orientation at one point in time and became, or are becoming, more subjective or “activist” in their ;13935;14439;;
Kirshenblatt-Gimblett;Yes, that is true, but museum activism today is being understood in different terms. namely, as activism in relation to the challenges of contemporary society—homelessness, hunger, inequality, exclusions, immigration, refugees, and much else. On the one hand, how can one argue with the ;14440;14686;;
Araujo;ICOM’s initiative can be understood in the context of the growing sentiment of uneasiness. stemming from current debates around the history of the so-called “mainstream” museums (many of which are either in Europe or North America), especially regarding how their collections were built. Although I ;14687;15199;;
Lichtenstein;In closing, I would like each of you to speak briefly about how your approach to museums shapes your pedagogy. How do you use museums in your teaching? How do you simultaneously permit museums to provoke joy and wonder in your students, even while helping them to remain critical of ;15200;15254;;
Ho;Museums present a dual opportunity: on the one hand, exhibits can make history personal and tangible. on the other hand, the objects on display are almost always part of a larger narrative that invites analysis as such. Because my current teaching is in the United States, one of my challenges is ;15255;15814;;
Conn;This is a great and for me somewhat embarrassing question. Given my regular rotation of classes, I don’t have occasion to engage with museums much in the classroom, and certainly not with the issues we’ve been discussing here. By and large, when I do get the chance, I introduce students to the ;15815;16049;;
Kirshenblatt-Gimblett;At this very moment, I am co-teaching an undergraduate summer seminar with the sociologist Mitchell Duneier for the Princeton Institute for International and Regional Studies. We are in residence at POLIN Museum of the History of Polish Jews in Warsaw and are using the core ;16050;16231;;
Redman;Museums, for all the many problems they pose, serve as uniquely valuable tools in my teaching. In my seminars dealing with museums, we begin by engaging with critical readings about institutions and discuss their histories and current problems. Then, as often as possible, we visit these places on ;16232;16780;;
Araujo;Because I live and work in the Washington, D.C., area, museums and museum exhibitions (especially at the Smithsonian) have shaped my pedagogy. In my undergraduate courses in Colonial Latin America at Howard University, students have visited and reviewed the exhibition The Great Inka ;16781;17450;;
Conklin;I have never taught museum-centered courses, in part because the museums I study have been so far away. Instead, in my European history courses, I have tended to use images from natural history museum displays to demonstrate how racial hierarchies were constructed visually as part of “good ;17451;17874;;
Lichtenstein;I want to thank all of you for your thoughtful engagement with a complex set of ideas and practices around the ever-shifting politics of curation and display. I think we all agree that museums constitute a crucial form of popular historical narrative that historians should pay close attention to. At the very ;17875;17960;;

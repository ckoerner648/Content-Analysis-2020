Ironworkers;"Henry ""Hank"" Lichte ";"00:01 Introduction, Background information, Entering the Trade [I am here at Ironworkers Union Hall Local #63 and am doing an interview. Please tell me your name.] Hank Lichte. [Tell me what year you were born, Hank.] I was born 1935. [And were you born here in Chicago?] Yes. [What neighborhood did you grow up in?] I grew up at Lincoln Park area: Armitage and Larrabee Street, it was called. [Oh yeah, I know where that is.] I lived there until I got married in 1955. [Now, were your parents German?] Yes. [Did you speak German as a kid?] They did in the house, but when I went to school, they said no more German to me because I have to speak English and they didn’t want to be talking German in the house no more. They would talk amongst themselves. Yet I can’t talk German now. I can understand a little bit but I can’t talk it. [And how did you get into ironworking? Did you come out of high school and go through an apprentice program or...?] Yeah, went through an apprentice program. I had a friend of mine that was an ironworker and he got me into the apprentice program in 1955. [Did you go to Washburn?] Yes. The old Washburn Trade School. Yeah. 1:25 [Tell me about your first job and where it was and what you were doing as an ironworker.] Oh. First job as an ironworker was in Barrington, Illinois. And it was snowing out, a very light snow. The building was only about 5 stories high. We were going to go work up on the iron and I figured, well, it’s snowing today, we can’t work up there. So I asked the foreman, “What we’re going to do today, are we going to work? He says, “Yeah, you’re going to work up there.” I said, “How are we going to work with all the snow on the beams?” He says, “It won’t be there when you get done wiping it off with this gunny sack. Get up there and get that snow off.” I wasn’t going to walk up there. I put the gunny sack down on the beam, sat on it, and just went like a snow plow, across the beam, pushing all the snow off while I’m sitting on it. That was my first job. [Did you have any safety stuff on at all?] No, no, of course not. We didn’t have anything like that. [And what kind of work were you doing? Were you welding or just doing labor work or what?] We were welding. We were putting in railings and they had to be what we call pipe insert put on the beam so when they pour the concrete, the pipe would be sticking out. Then the railings would fit into that pipe because they were removable. It was a little exciting the first day. [Yeah, did it take a little while for you to get used to that?] Yeah but not very long because you’re concentrating more on what you’re doing. You’re trying to stay safe and it’s impossible to stay dry. It worked out. The first day was fine and after that, no problem. [So after that job which was out in Barrington, did you start working more in the Chicago area or...?] Yeah, all over, all over the Chicago area. We worked on... The company I was with, I served my apprenticeship with them because I was what they called an indentured apprentice. That means you have to sign a contract with these people and they had to honor the contract also. I couldn’t quit and they couldn’t lay me off. So they had me work 40 hours a week. If there was no work, I had to go in to the shop, so that I would get my time in. You couldn’t make any extra money. It was right down to the penny. I think when I started I made $1.55/hour. They wouldn’t give you a raise until your year was up. Then you’d go...to the next stage, 50%, 60%,  and... In my 4th year, I became a foreman for the company because I had been with them for so long. They had to pay me foreman scale, but that was the first time I ever made any real money with them. [What was the name of the company?] David Architectural Metals. They’re still in business by the way. But they don’t do any erection any more. I think they have a contractor that does some erection, but they still have a shop on the South Side of Chicago. 4:45 [Did you work on any... You showed me some photographs from a job site at 2801. Now that looked like that was a taller building there.] At that time on the north side it was. It was 29 or 30 stories up. See those old pictures with two guys on that cage on the outside? You see the aluminum. There was a special aluminum that fit on the corners which these guys were getting ready to install. And after it was up, the building was up, these corners were leaking water. So we had to go back and they set up a pole off the roof. All it was was a six by six timber with some sand bags on. They put a block out there and we had an electric hoist on the bottom, similar to what you see here but smaller. We ran a cable up through to the shiv on top in the roof of the building and down in a boun's chair. [Also ""boatswain's chair,"" a device to suspend a person from a rope, a harness common to work on ships and now used to suspend people from high buildings.] Naturally, me being the apprentice, it was my job to go up in the bosun's chair and the guy on the bottom would run the machine. I would just signal him to stop and then I could caulk where the leak was and we knew on every place, every floor the exact spot where the leak was. Well, I probably got about 16 of the 24 and I’m signaling to the guy and he didn’t stop. And this chair keeps going up and up and up and the next think I know, I see him running. And I go up and he’s leaving that machine. What’s happening here? So I had a belt around me that, to hold me to the bosun's chair. I took the belt off and I stood up on the seat and held on to the cable because we were getting up to 22 or 23. I figured when we get up to the top, I’m getting off in a hurry because it was going to pull everything up there down. [Down. Yeah.] Finally we got maybe three-fourth from the top and it stopped. I told them to take me down because I passed everything already that we were supposed to caulk. All he could do is release the, there was an electric brake and he had to release the brake by hand and I would go down real slow. What happened was the points in the contact in the motor fused together and he couldn’t shut it off. He had to run inside the fuse box and pull the, no plugs natural, go directly into the fuse box and he couldn’t unplug it so he ran over there and yanked the cord right out of the fuse box and it stopped just in time. That was interesting on that job. 7:35 [Did you have a lot of close calls like that over the years?] Oh you have ‘em you know. Everybody can tell you close calls that they have. I was working in the, we were working in the brewery and there was an explosion. We were putting stairs up and we were using block and tackles in them days. And I was up about 4-5 floors and there was an explosion. And the people... It was a working brewery and people in there hollered, “Ammonia, get out!” So I was up on higher floors and the block and tackle was hanging down in the middle of the stairway opening. So I jumped for the rope to slide down the rope on the block and tackles. And just before I went for it, somebody on the floor below did and knocked it out of my way. It just so  happened that it didn’t go that far because I was free falling then. And then when it swung back, I caught it. I burned my hands, I only stopped about maybe a floor and half before I hit the bottom, but I burned all the skin off my hands when I stopped. I slowed myself down enough that I didn’t, I didn’t get hurt. So that was kind of close. And...oh... I don’t know. We were working on the Powerhouse and I had to go change a snatch block and the hoist only went on certain levels. So I went up above, slid down to where I was going to change the snatch block. That’s a... We put a cable in for hoisting. And I changed that and I was going to slide down the column to the next level so I could walk back the beam to the hoist. And unbeknown to me, the painters had painted the columns before I got down there. I grabbed the column and slid right down on that wet paint. I went sliding down and I hit the beam just below and it was also painted. But there was one off to the side that they hadn’t painted yet. So I was all full of paint in the front and I was able to get over to the other beam and walk back on the dry ones. I never noticed, you know you’re not thinking sometimes when you’re doing stuff. But its stuff like that. We were working on Marina City, I don’t know if you... [Oh yeah, sure.] Well, we were working there and putting all the railings around the outside of it. And I don’t know where we were 23 or 24, something like that. The plasterers, the laborers were used to carry the planks out in the balcony, they’d hit our railing and bump, and they knew they couldn’t go any further. Then they could swing over to the other room inside the apartment to set up the scaffold for the plasterers. Well, they got one floor ahead of us and this laborer backed out into the plank and there was no railing there for him to bump and went right over. It’s... Stuff like that happens all the time. 10:45 [Did you see a lot of safety changes from the time you started to the time you retired?] Oh, all the time. [What year did you retire?] I retired in 2004. [So you saw a lot of those changes take place then.] Oh yeah. I worked 25 years on the outside and then I worked 25 years for the Chicago Park District. I invested as an ironworker for my pension and my business agent at the time told me, he says, “There aren't a lot guys that live in the city. A lot of ironworkers move to the suburbs.” He says, “The Chicago Park District is looking to put someone on. Why don’t you go down there and I’ll give you a letter to take it down there. Take an interview, maybe start yourself another pension.” So I went down there and they says, “Yeah, we’ll hire you.” It wasn’t nothing political or anything. So I just went down and worked for them. And then when I retired from the park district, they said I should come back and work one more year on the outside here or I had to get 1000 hours, so that’s six months. I went back to work and they sent me downtown on a high rise downtown. I hadn’t been on a high rise, so they give me a safety harness to put on. I had never even seen one of these. So the kids are telling me, “Here, we’ll help you get it on.” And its got the hooks on the back and everything. And I told them I said, “The last time I put something like this on,” I says, “I jumped out of a good airplane over Normandy.” [LAUGHTER] These kids believed me. [LAUGHTER] Like you say, safety stuff, we never had any of that kind of stuff. Now there’s a scaffolds, if you're on a scaffold, there’s cables hanging down, you have belts on connected to the safety cables. I never knew what that was.  12:54 [When you started, were there a lot of Germans or ethnic groups within the union you were in, the ironworkers?] No, not really. [It wasn’t like some unions that used to be Italians, like the tile guys or anything...] Yeah, like cement fitters? [Yeah.] No, this was pretty... They were quite a few Germans in there but it was all mixed up. Some of these guys in the pictures here are Irish and Polish and what have you. It was all mixed up and all good guys. There wasn’t... We didn’t have a very good local at that time, and I don’t think there were 400-500 members then. Which we’re not that big now either. I think we’re about 1200 I think. It was all pretty...look out for each other and try to find work for each other. They were good to me. 13:48 [Did you guys play jokes on each other, especially with the new workers? Was that something you used to do?] No, I don’t... [Any practical jokes?] Well, they might have done some stuff once in a while but, we didn’t play around too much in the jobs. The guys are pretty serious about what they were doing. You’re up in the air working, sometimes you don’t want to play around too much. I don’t remember anything. [Did you guys have any... I know sometimes for a really tall building, probably did it at Marina Towers, topped it off. Are there any other kinds of things like when you finished a job or whatever, any rituals that you had?] Yeah, they’d have topping off parties. In fact, the one, this 2801 here. It was an aluminum building and we had a lot of aluminum scrap left over. So they scrapped the aluminum, took the money, and this one guy, Danny Gundlock, a big brute guy that you see looking out from below... [Oh yeah, that picture.] Yeah. He lived out along O’Hare Field. He got a big house with a lot of property. So they had a barbecue out by his house and everybody’s talking and drinking beer. Talking about stories and telling stories and is wife, a little tiny woman, she says, “He came home from a union meeting one night,” she said, “He’s all drunk and its 3 o’clock in the morning and he wakes me up,” she says. I don’t think this woman's even 5 feet tall. “And he wanted breakfast,” she said. “So I’m in the kitchen cooking eggs and he’s in the shower to wake up. That’s when I woke up. I got the bacon and eggs. What am I doing here?” She walked into the shower and laid a hot frying pan on his ass with the bacon in it. [LAUGHTER] That woke him up, she said, and he didn’t deny it. [LAUGHTER] There are a lot of stories like that. 16:01 [Did you ever have to go on strike with any of the job sites you were in?] No. [You were pretty lucky here in Chicago it seems like.] Yeah, we didn’t have any strikes all the time I was there. Because I was... They had some of the bigger jobs, but the contractors always was with, some of the bigger jobs went on strike but some of the smaller contractors, whatever they settled for, we’ll settled. So don’t go on strike with us. So we didn’t. I never went on strike. [Did you feel that most of the time in your career that the contractors and the union got along pretty well here in Chicago?] Very well. They really did because... It’s a shame that you see the unions going down now because we worked so hard for what we did, especially safety wise. And now you go and see these people working on scaffolds with no safety lines. No nothing. [He mean's non-union ironworkers] And we worked hard to get to that point and now it’s nothing. In fact, in  my neighborhood, they’re doing a lot of home building where I live and you see guys that are working Saturdays, Sundays. You know they’re not getting overtime. [What neighborhood is that?] I live at what they call the North Center. I’m on the north side of Irving Park, Lincoln Avenue and Damen. [I know where that is.] I’ve lived there for 47 years. It’s a nice neighborhood, but its not up and coming because it’s already up, but they keep tearing down them down and building new ones. I’ve watched these guys working. I could never work like that. They would never let us. [Yeah, I live over on Sheridan, not that far from you, and I see these job sites and see guys working with tennis shoes on and t-shirts...] That’s exactly right. Yeah. And how can they do it? It almost seems like the government wants this...because I just heard that...tradesmen from Poland and people from Poland, they don’t have to have visas no more, they’re just bringing them in because they said we need construction workers here. We don’t need construction workers. We have plenty. But they’re going to flood it so they can do all of this. What they’re doing is union busting is what they want to do. Bust the unions right down. And then they got a good foothold. I’m out of it, but my son is still an ironworker. [Is he in #63?] Yes. [What does he do?] Well, right now he’s laid off. He’s not working right now. But he’s alright. He's single and put his money away. He’s got a two flat building, so he’s collecting the rent. He’s not hurting. I’ve got it made right now since I’ve retired. I have a home in Arizona and I go there in the winter time and come back here in the summertime. What more can you ask for? 19:30 [Well, I asked the questions I needed to ask. Is there anything else you’d like to talk about, the union or the work you’ve done? I’d be happy to hear what you have to say, if you want to add anything else.] I think we’ve pretty much covered it. I haven’t been around much like most of these guys here. A lot of them work for a contractor one month or a week or a day. I’ve been very fortunate. I’ve worked for the company that I served my apprenticeship with. I worked for them for 12 years. I worked for another company doing over head door works, steel doors and fire doors. I worked for that company for 11 years and just a couple in between before I went to the Park District. I don’t think that I’ve worked for 15 contractors in 50 years. You don’t hear that. [Yeah, you’ve had pretty steady employment the whole time.] I did. Yeah. I’ve been very fortunate...to have a... Of course once you get to doing doors, once you get a name that you do doors and that’s your specialty, you work pretty steady. [Was that one of those heavy iron doors?] Yeah. You see them in loading docks, the big steel ones that roll up. [Oh yeah.] And O’Hare, the hanger doors. [Oh, those great big ones.] Yeah. In fact, when I came back from retirement with the Park District, the first place I worked at was O’Hare. We had to re-cable them big doors, the same ones that I worked on years ago. [How do they put those in because those are really high. That’s got to be what, 3-4 stories high at least.] Oh yeah. It all comes in sections and then you bolt it all together. But when we re-cabled it, everything is just there. Interesting though. 21:33 [What did you do for the Park District? I didn’t ask that.] We did mostly the docks and the harbors. All summer long, in the docks and the harbors. In the winter time, there’s always  stuff to do at the zoo. All kinds of work in the zoo. [With the animal cages and everything?] Exactly right. We kept a crew there constantly. Sometimes you’d get a call in the middle of the night. Something would happen. They called me one night that a lion was broken through a door, but it was only going to get him to another cage but they said they couldn’t have him wandering back and forth. I don’t know, they called me around midnight. I get down there and get over there in my truck and the lion was over there and there was a small passage door, steel sliding door. And its bouncing back and forth. It’s him and I can see the claw coming up. And I said, “What do you want me to do?” I says, “I can’t get in there with this...his foot came out.” So they went and got a fire hose and forced it to the other side of the cage. I was able to get in there and weld something on there, put some angles on it and I welded it so that at least it would hold until they could get him transferred somewhere else. Then I went took care of both sides of the doors. That was very interesting. They had in the reptile house, the alligators, they had a swing gate down there. And they would swing the gate and keep the alligators on one side while they cleaned the other side. Then they would open the gate and push them to the other side with the hose. They would go to the other side, swing the gate again, and clean the other side. Well the gate was rotted out from so many years. So they called us down there and they said, “Ok, we’ll hold them over here – there’s only a little hole to climb through.” And they said, “We’ll hold them over here and you guys take the gate off.” I said, “What do you mean, you’re going to hold ‘em.” They had a broomstick. And they said, “If they come and poke ‘em back.” And I said, “They ain’t coming on me.” I went in there with a torch. And if your alligator comes toward me, I’m going to burn him with this torch. I’m going to shove this right down his mouth.” They said, “We can’t have that.” “Then that gate ain’t getting fixed.” [LAUGHTER] So they finally got... They got some of the gators transferred to another, just the meaner ones, to another cage. And the ones that were a little more docile, they were held to the side and the carpenters come in there, and built like a plywood wall. And we were able to take the gate off because it took us a week to build a new one. 24:37 [A lot of the work, like when you did that stuff, and when I talk to ironworkers, it seems like they have ato have a really good knowledge. It’s not like you take a pre-fab thing. You’ve got to build that from scratch and do all that.] Yes. Everything in the Park District was from scratch because everything was so old. You had to build everything. In the reptile house one time I had to work that cage. There was powder all over the floor. I went into the back and said, “What’s this?” And they put baking soda on the floor when a snake escapes. They can tell where its at over night. If it runs around, they can follow the marks and they know where the snake is. I says, “So there’s a loose snake in here?” “Yeah, but he made too many marks. We can’t find him again.” “See you later.” [LAUGHTER] [What about the stuff you did along the water front. Was that like in the slips and stuff?] Exactly. We re-built the slips. Everything rots out below the water or above the water, and the boats hit them. All summer long. I would go there, I would start in, I tried to start in March. There is a lot of stuff you can do because you’ve got to take things out of the water and some of them are called floating stars. [Oh yeah, I know exactly because I live out by Montrose so I go over there.] Okay. We had to take those stars out  of the water. Sometimes dismantle them. We’d put them on shore and we could work on shore at that time of the year. In fact, they asked me... They wanted to build... “We need something to maneuver those stars when we take them apart. You seen the fingers on the stars. Sometimes we could take the fingers off and bring them back to shore and then with a crane would lift them off but I can lift them with my truck because I have a crane on my truck. But we had no way to keep them from out there because they would tip over. They would flip upside down. So they would ask me if I could design a boat or a barge. And I did. I did it at my kitchen table. I made drawings. I had no knowledge of this but I knew what I wanted to work with. And I designed a barge and they bought the two pontoons and they asked me where they should get them. I says, “Chicago Boiler would make us that.” I went to Chicago Boiler and told them what I wanted. They made them. And I made the platform, and built the barge, and put two outboard motors on and tool boxes. Welder on there, a torch. All the tools you needed were now on the barge. And I put a boom on the front, a little crane on the front so it would stick out. The finger would go in between these two pontoons and we would hook the other in onto the finger and lift it right up out of the water and take it right to shore. It worked perfect. [So you basically... Did you weld that barge together yourself?] Yeah, all I had was the two pontoons. I made it all myself. I have a whole roledex of pictures of the progress that we did. It really came out nice. [You say you drove your truck there. Was that for a contractor? Did you work for a contractor then or directly for the Park District.] Directly for the Park District. I drove a truck with a crane on it. [Did you have a crew go with you then? Or was it you and...] I would have usually myself, one ironworker, sometimes in the summertime when it got business, we’d have four. And I would have carpenters. I think three carpenters and maybe a laborer. That was our crew. And I would work all the way up to almost Christmas. In fact, they had a new, what they call a district engineer who is in charge of the construction section that I was working at. But I came in at Christmas, just before Christmas one year...the first year he was there. He asked my foreman, “Who is that guy?” He’d never seen me. All summer long. [So you were gone all the time.] I was gone all the time. If I needed something, I’d call it in and they’d send a truck out. And I would just leave my truck on the job site inside Belmont Harbor inside the building. [Oh yeah. Did you have to cover all the territory from Evanston and up there in Howard Street all the way to the South Side, doing stuff?] We’d break at the river. We’d do the north. The South Side and Main Street, they worked out of...they took everything south of the river. [Was that an interesting job because there was change all the time, you did different things?] Yeah. It was really interesting. [And that was the stuff at the zoo, was tied in with all of that, it was all part of being with the Park District] Oh yeah. You’d get out and into the city parks. You’d have to do playgrounds, fences and guard rails. You name it. Tennis courts. There’s no end to it. [And you had to figure it out yourself.] Yeah. [The fences and...] Yeah. Whatever you had to do. Buckingham Foundation. That was ours. Billy McClean [see interview with McClean] and I... You’ll probably talk to him. We had to go and work inside one of those sea horses that shoot the water. Billy scratched his initials inside of him. And Billy’s father? His father was the one, when they had the valves that made the fountain go... His father was an engineer and he did it manually. [Wow.] Billy’s father. He made all those...the timing and all that stuff. His Dad  would stay down there and it’s a little house that you can look out and the windows aren’t very high so you wouldn’t obstruct anyone’s vision. He could watch the fountain and he would do all the controls by hand. Now it’s all automatic. [Yeah, I remember hearing there’s some computer in Atlanta or something that controls it.] Yeah, Minneapolis. [Oh, Minneapolis. Ok.] They control all that. But Billy’s Dad did it all. And you’ll probably interview Billy. [I’ll make a point of it.] He’ll tell you all about it. [Well, its really been a pleasure talking with you.] My pleasure. [Thanks so much.] ok. END 31:29 "
Ironworkers;Walter “Wally” Ritch ;00:01     [Tell me your name and where you were born.] I’m Wally Ritch. I was born in Chicago. [What year were you born?] 1944. [Tell me a little bit about how you got into ironwork. Did you have a job before that? Where did you go to school?] Well, I went to school at, high school at St. Pat- rick’s. And my one friend who I grew up with, he got in when he was 18 because his brother was in. He was an ironworker and I worked just different jobs. Then he says, “Why don’t you try to get in?” And I was 25. And I took the test and I got right in through another ironworker. I had to go through the test and went to school and stuff. It wasn’t just getting a book. [What was your first job as an ironworker? Do you remember?] My first job... As a matter of fact, the gentleman is in the other room. It was at a railing outfit. We did railings and stairs. It was American Ornamental Railing. I worked there through my whole apprenticeship. As a matter of fact, I was an indentured apprentice for the first three years. Then they quit the indentureship because they were having too much problems. [What was the indentured? What was different about that?] Well, when you’re indentured, the union signs, the company signs, and you sign like a contract that you will stay with the company for your full four years. You can’t quit and go to a different outfit. That’s what was happening. Guys would work for a year or so with an outfit, then learn all the stuff and then some other outfit would give them an extra buck and then they’d quit and just go to the other outfit. This way you weren’t stuck with the company but you had to stay with the company for your apprenticeship. But they guaranteed you, or were suppose to guarantee you forty hours. [A week...during that period...] Right. [What kind of work did you do for them?] I’d... We’d put in railings and stairs, and then when it was a little slow, you worked in the shop. You’d cut shims and you’d help them weld stuff. [Was there a lot of weld- ing involved in that job?] Yes. And I went to Washburn Trade School. [I know where that was. It’s out of business now I think, right?] Yeah. But that was where our union had our apprentice- ship, at Washburn. Then, went there for the four years. That’s where you learned your trade.     2:48 [And then after you left that job, what kind of work did you do over the years?] Well, basi- cally after that, I basically did, like, windows and curtain walls. [That sounds like the high rises, the stuff you hang on the outside.] Yes, that or you’re putting in windows basically. The outfit I was with for, oh, maybe 10-12 years in the architectural. That’s what I did, just put in windows. [Did you work on some of the real tall buildings down town? You probably worked on every- thing, right?] Yeah. Most of them at that time, and I’m talking about like in the 80s. Most of the buildings going up were like 40-50 stories. And it was a lot of punch out windows, but they made money. And that’s the bottom line. The company was making money. And then after that, I worked with just different outfits. I worked at Navy Pier. [When they were re-modeling everything out there?] Yes. I worked Navy Pier. Trump Tower. [Did you work on the win- dows in Trump Tower?] Yes. The curtain wall at Trump Towe. Another big one was Soldiers Field. [And how does that current wall... I’m vaguely familiar with the process, but do they bring in all sections on the cranes and then put them on or...] No, its... Its... There’s so many different ways. You’ve got your mullions. You put in your mullions first and then the windows. The glass goes into the mullions. Now a days, its different is that they put clips out onto the edge and everything sits on the clips and it just keeps going up, like... Trump Towers was like that. [That speeds up the process a lot.] Definitely.     4:49 [Now were there other unions that there were sometimes jurisdictional things... Like how to separate you from... Was it the glazers that...] Glazers... Well, you know... It’s been... They are our more mortal enemies. [LAUGHTER] It’s just. I’m being honest. [Yeah, I un- derstand.] Before, it used to be that you put in all the metal and then the glazers came by and put in all the glass. But then they started putting the glass into the frames. That’s how we claimed everything. [The manufacturers did that...] Right. [Yeah.] Then you’re just setting the frames. When it came to Soldiers Field, we did all the glass. The glazers... I don’t know why... I hope I don’t get anyone into trouble, but we did everything. The interior. They just... I don’t know if they didn’t want it because it was tough. It was tough. A lot of work, a lot of heavy work. And at Soldiers Field, we dealt with Gartner who was from Germany. A lot of their prints were in German. They were metric and it made for difficulty in installation. It did. But, like Navy Pier, like, I’m going back, that was like ‘91. I don’t know if you’ve ever been there... [Many times.] ...but all the bones, all up in the ceilings and then the glass went into that and all the frames and stuff. [Is that all at the very end, what you’re talking about? Or are you talking about...?] It’s all the ceiling. [Oh right, ok.] And all that inside... It just, there was a lot of work. A ton of work. But I can’t complain about my life as an ironworker. It just... It’s a nice life, if you keep it in perspective. The way I always looked at it, the company’s got to make money. It’s not you making money, it’s the company’s got to make it. Because if the company doesn’t make money, you’re out of a job. And that’s what and a why people should start looking at it, is that the com- pany’s got to make money. If they don’t, you’re out of a job. [It seems like the unions and the companies kind of get that in Chicago, not just the ironworkers. You know.] Yes. [What do you think it is about Chicago that makes it different than so many cities where there is such a hostile climate between...] Well... [Is it the history of the city and they had to work it out a long time ago and its working?] I just think that long time ago, everybody knows is that scabs couldn’t come into the city for the longest time, because everybody was watching out for them, the non-union. And that’s what kept this city strong, was the unions. As long as you kept them out, that’s why it stayed strong. It’s basically keeping the non-union out.     8:06 [Did you get involved with any strike activity? Did you have to go out?] You know, knock on wood, I’ve missed a few days because of a strike. Not in this city, no. I’ve been off because of lack of work, but not like it is today. Years ago, I think the last time...this city was in trouble with the union. Not trouble but... It was like 91-92 it was real slow. There was like 350 guys off. So for one year, I maybe worked a week here and a week there. But before that, we just kept busy.     8:55 [What do you think was the biggest change in the work from the time you started until now. You were talking about safety...] I would say the biggest is safety is because I don’t know if nobody realized it but I always tell the apprentices today. When we used to do windows, and you were on the 40th floor, you’d put up two benches and a plank to walk across and you did your headers for your windows. You had no safety belt on. There was nothing in front of you. That’s how you worked back then. Today’s day and age, you can’t be within 6 feet of the edge without a belt. That’s the biggest change to me in ironworker safety. [When did you see that change start to take place? Was it in the 70s with OSHA?] No, no... It was after that. It was way after that. It was way after that. Then OSHA started stepping in and seeing people working by the edge with nothing on, no harness or nothing, or even a belt. At first it was just, you had a belt and a line attached to it. But then as it went on, it got more and more... You got the har- nesses and everything like that. In today’s day and age... You know...I mean it’s totally differ- ent. [You seem to think that was a good change. I know one of the other guys was more nostal- gic or...for the past. What’s your perspective on that?] My perspective is... It’s for the good. Because I would have had 4-5 guys that would be dead today if they didn’t have their belt on be- cause it happens. It happens. You make the slightest mistake and adios. [Were you ever seri- ously injured on the job at all? Or were you lucky?] Well, no, there was a couple of times when it was close. I... One time a louver fell on me and knocked me off the truck. I hurt my leg real bad. [And what’s a louver?] That’s where air goes through, those slat things on the sides of buildings. We were working there on a job down town. How we were picking it up, the louver tipped and knocked me off. Luckily that’s all that happened. I just got a bruised up leg, but I was off for a couple of weeks because it swelled up and stuff like that.     11:44 Another time, this happened just before I retired. I was going up a lift. What do you call them? The scaffold lift that bricklayers use, the power one. [Yup.] We were running a job and it was like five stories up because we were working in an alley. [Wally left to take a phone call] So that time that I almost was closest to being killed is I was going up the scaffold and I think at that time, I was 60. And as I’m going up, I’m going up holding on with two hands, taking steps just to be safe. A laborer was coming down. Luckily I had both hands on it and he stuck right on me. Luckily, I had two hands on it because if I only had one, I wouldn’t be here today. So that’s.... But it happens. He was a young kid who didn’t look. Because I was up 4 – 4 1⁄2 sto- ries. Anyway...luckily I was with two hands.     13:10 [When you started, was/were there different ethnic groups within the union that you re- member? Or was that already breaking down by then?] No, that was... We didn’t have nothing like that. I don’t remember it. I don’t remember it at all. There was times in the 80s that we had to take certain ethnic groups on the jobs but you made do. [And now you have this apprentice program here that seems to recruit all kinds of different people.] Right, right. Well, back then, we had all kinds too. [Oh you did.] Oh Yeah.     13:52 [Did you ever work in other job markets or were you lucky with real steady work here in Chicago. I talked to Rich, he was booming out to different parts of the country.] I was lucky here. I was lucky here. Then that ‘91-’92, my one nephew, his buddy owned... He was a build- er. Believe it or not, I built porches and whatever this guy wanted to supplement working until the union got me another job. Back then you were 300 on a list, you knew you were going to be off for a while. I stayed here. I did a couple of times travel for this company, the Inland I was talking about. I traveled to the east coast, Philadelphia and New York. But that was just over- seeing. I was a boss and we were slow here, so my boss says, “You want to go to Philadelphia for a couple of weeks?” And I said sure. And I just helped on that job. I didn’t do any work, just watched the guys and show ‘em our system and...you know. I never really was a boomer boomer.     15:15 [Were there any customs that you guys had? I know there’s topping off... I know Local #1does a lot of that because you’re way up on the top. Are there any customs that you guys had or rituals in your trade?] Yeah, well, it depends on what the job was like. I remember one job, we had one of the guys died. He didn’t get killed on the job, but he died. So up in one of the corners, we put our names on one of the beams that was in already. That was about it. There wasn’t, nah I don’t think... Back then the customs was maybe going to the bar at lunch. [Yeah.] But that was not okay back then, but we did it. [Rich talked about the drinking too, that there was a program now to kind of limit that more. Kind of educate guys. Did you see a big shift in that?] Without a doubt. Back in the 80s, that was common. Now it’s rare because the compa- nies... [Liability.] ...liability, plus the contractors. Believe it or not, some of the contractors, for a while, were following the guys at lunch to see where they go. If they see you going in the bars, when you come out, they go to the owner and say, “Hey, your guys are going to the bar. We can’t have this.” Which you can’t blame them. It’s different today. Very different.     17:17 [Anything like clothes that were distinctive about ironworkers or their...?] Just that, well, with us #63, we always had our helmets on backwards. That was us. [Did you have a certain kind of helmet?] No, no, but every one was backwards. And I guess today its not the same, be- cause you can’t do it anymore. [Oh, ok.] On your high rise jobs with the insurance companies, everything has to got to be just so. And years ago, you didn’t have to wear safety glasses. Now, today, they are automatic on the job.     18:00 [Did you do welding at home or develop a hobby with welding? Like the signs out here and some other stuff...] No, not really. No. I did most of my welding when I first got in but... [Then you did more of the glass stuff...] But then towards... Today, it’s more the glass and then they would always have certain guys who were just welders, welding the clips, or weld the beams or stuff like that. But way back then, I just did what I did because it was the job. There was no, no hobby about it. It was just part of the job.     18:41 [What year did you retire in?] I retired six years ago. [2005?] Yeah, I think it was. I think it was 2005...yeah, cause . . . End of 2004 or beginning of 2005. [And now are you the official president of the retire club or...?] Yeah, well, they call me chairman. But its... I just try to help the guys. Try to coordinate stuff. [So you have a monthly gathering here?] Yes. [And how many people are involved in the retirees club?] Usually we get between, I would say 30-40 on the average, I’d say. And then sometimes we’d get more, like in the wintertime, a lot of the guys go to Florida for the winter, so they don’t show up. Its basically... Then this past year, we had five guys die. Some of the old-old timers. This guy, Steve, who was always here – he was 92. Eddy Root, he was 91. Our Ex BA, he just died. Don Holt. I don’t know how old he was but he was up there. So, you loose guys...and now with things being slow, we got more guys retiring. [Taking early retirement?] Right. Yeah.     20:14 [Well, you’ve answered all of my questions. Is there something you want to talk about connected to your work or the union.] It’s a nice life if you got it in your head that it’s a job job to where you have to get up and go do it. You’ve got to want to. Like when I was at Soldiers Field, we worked 7/12s. And it was tough at the end because I was one of the bosses. It was tough. But you’ve got to want to do it. Just... And the kids today, they’re hard to talk to be- cause--‘cause I’m being honest. For a while there, drugs played an important part and it still does in today’s... Some of these kids were on it. You didn’t want to get them in trouble, but they would screw up the job. So you sort of, you try to tell them, “Hey, this is your life. Don’t screw it up.” “Yeah, yeah, yeah.” You got to like what you do. If you don’t like it, find some- thing else. That’s with anything in life. You could be making $150,000, but if you can find something you like and make $100,000, forget that $50,000. Do what you like to do. Get up and want to do something. Other than that, I love being retired. [LAUGHTER]     END: 22:00
Ironworkers;David Olby;0:01 Testing equipment. Announcement, initial question–when and where born, how you got into ironworkers trade? 1:08 Well, I was born in 1949 and actually I was born in a Model-T on White River Hill. Never made it to the hospital but... Born at a very young age [chuckles]. Well, I grew up south of Sanborn, on a little farm. And we farmed for quite a few years. Milking thirteen cows at the most, by hand, my younger sister and my older brother and I. And at that time Dad was gone all week, and then he’d come home on the weekends. He was gone on different ironworking jobs. And so we’d have a list of chores to do throughout the week. And when he come home on the weekend things had better be pretty well done. And back then you did what your parents told you. And if you didn’t there was–we had a lot of willow growing up around the place. So we’d get to choose whichever stick we wanted. Luckily that didn’t happen very often, but whenever it did we deserved it. So we did that. We did the farming for a number of years, through our teen years. Kept us off the street, kept us busy. And I think that was dad’s main goal. For the most part it was a good life, and we grew up that way, raising our own meat, and started deer hunting when we were 12. And Dad wouldn’t buy us a new rifle, he bought us used ones so they were broke in and knew that they were good quality. So we, my brother and I, started in with 30/30 Winchesters. And I’m probably missing a lot of things in-between here, but time is short. 3:28 So we did that and our first hunting experience was being dropped off at the edge of the woods, and picked up in the evening. We could go hunt and do whatever we wanted to do. We did have training, home training, before we were dropped off. And Dad always told us that during the winter when we have nothing to do to take our rifles down and snap in with them. Make sure they were empty, and on safe and everything...and just snap in with them and...get used to them. Probably one of the biggest bucks I ever got in my life was on account of that training. This is after I had been in the Marine Corps and went through all of their training. I had this nice buck standing in front of me and we were taught in the Marine Corps, BRASS... Breath, relax, aim, sites, squeeze. And I did all of that. Squeezed off the shot. The buck stood there. And in my mind, I’m just going crazy, trying to figure out what I did wrong. And I knew I had to make a quick decision so I just upped and snapped and shot and down he went. And...so that was...Dad’s training. 4:55 [Gets choked up thinking about his dad. Leary talks a little about his late father: [I thought a lot about my Dad on the way up here. He died two years ago. Every day I think about him...than something happens and it reminds me of something he told me. I was cleaning the storm windows yesterday with my brother. We were putting them on the old home place. The old man would have... He would have been out there cracking the whip on us. LAUGHS] 5:39 So that was probably one of the best experiences I had. In that year, Dad had been fighting cancer for two years and that was the last...that was the last...time he hunted with us. We started dragging the buck out of the woods. We had about a mile and a half to drag it. And it was a real dry, crisp year and no snow on the ground. And Dad had walked into his favorite pine tree and that was about as far as he could get. And he was sitting there when we came dragging that buck out. [Wow.] And...I had a grin on my face probably like a jack o’lantern. Buttons already to pop off my shirt and Dad says, “It’s a keeper.” LAUGHS So we had to kind of laugh because when we got the deer out to the car, and went to load it up, one side was bare. It didn’t have any hair left on it I guess because the ground was so dry. LAUGHS I’m going to jump  ahead a little bit here on this story. Thirty years later, my daughter married a taxidermist and I was telling them the whole story about this particular deer. And he asked me all about which way it was facing and what his face looked like and if it had a lot of grey on it. And whereabouts the grey was and things like that. And...I thought he was being just curious. Well, thirty years later, for Christmas, I get a shoulder mount...of that deer. [David gets a little choked up.] I don’t know how you would say it but that brought that dead deer back to life. [Wow.] Even though it was still dead. But more than that, it about the memory back to life. He did such a good job on it and, right to this day, we have it hanging in the living room with a guarantee that...he would fix it if anything was wrong with it. So it don’t get any better than that. [Very cool.] 9:04 So that’s just a little bit about growing up. In my senior year, well, all through this--the whole time--Dad is doing his, he always was a great lover of country music and Dad always said, “There’s--my two favorite kinds of music are country, and western.” LAUGHS And that was always interwoven throughout our childhoods and it was quite a bond. And in the earlier years, Mom and Dad made sure we got to Sunday school. And we always had a neighbor, Augie Moss, who would come down and have coffee with Mom and Dad on Sunday mornings. And his mother was very old at that time and he would take her to church. Then he would come down and gab with Mom and Dad. And that was pretty regular. That was like every Sunday. So we had a pretty good Christian upbringing. And I think later on, having that woven into our family held us together when things started to go, health-wise, started to go upside down. That was a very valuable part of our bringing up too. 10:50 In my senior year in high school, I asked Dad if I could--at Christmas break--if I could go with him on one of his jobs. And he said. “Sure.” So I had two weeks of hanging with the guys. And my brother already was working for Dad. And I think the job I went with on Dad, the first one was, I never even got to the job site. I ended up being the chief cook and bottle washer while he was at work. So that was kind of a letdown, but I got to be by the guys anyway so that was ok. But then in the spring, when school was done, then I went on the first job with him. And it was kind of a crude awakening. We’re standing, looking at this framework, this red iron and Dad says, “Are you going to be a ground man or are you going to be an ironworker?” And I said, “Well, I’ll be an ironworker.” He says, “Well, get up there.” I looked around for a ladder and there was no ladder. And I said, “Well, how am I gonna get up there?” And he showed me one time how to grab the column and walk up the column until you get to the, to the purlins and climb up there and walk the web up on the bent and upper beam. And that’s what I did. And I was amazed that I could do that. And from that point on, we just got better at working together, my brother and I. Not too bad for a couple of guys who fought like cats and dogs when we were farming but we learned to rely on each other because... 13:06 My brother Larry and I, we could walk right on top of the steel and carry the next, carry the next purlin up and lay it in place. And in order to do that, you had to have a good teammate. ‘Cause if one of you slipped, you had to know exactly what to do so you wouldn’t drag each  other into the hole or take a fall. I think back on it now and we did have a few close calls. I think everybody does. You do things that get you in trouble without even realizing you’re heading that way. I was up on top of a scaffolding, this was in White Pine, Michigan. We were working on the wheelhouse for the big bucket that went down the mine shaft. And they would fill it and bring it to the surface. So we were working on the wheelhouse which had a 60 foot eave height. And I climbed up off of the scaffolding onto the roof. We had the sheet steel on already. And it was early in the morning and I was walking kind of at a diagonal over to the ridge into the gable end at the same time, kind of side-stepping. And I stepped off of the dry part of the roof and got into the morning moisture and frost. And before I realized it, I’m sliding backwards. So I laid down flat and grabbed the ribs on the steel with both of my hands and was trying to get a foot stuck on the screw heads, just off the sliding end. Ever so slowly, I just kept sliding--and I got down to the edge of the eave and the lower part of my legs were hanging over already. And I looked over my shoulder and all I could see down below was frozen ground and I figured, either I’m dead or broke up really bad. And about the time I come to that conclusion, this big ol’ arm reaches up [David gets choked up a little], reached across off of the scaffolding and that was on the gable end. And he yanked me over there. And--before I could even take a breath, I got my butt chewed big time. And that was Dad. And he said, “What were you thinking?” And I says, “Dad, I guess I wasn’t.” So he just let it go at that. And... 16:29 One other time we were working on an airplane hangar which wasn’t very high. Just the way things happen, you’ve got to be thinking all the time, every minute of the day because you’re working high in the air and--stupid mistakes get people killed. We were laying the sheet steel and, as we were doing that, we would lay the insulation and staple it together and then lay the next sheet steel on top of that. And so on and so forth. And, ahead of the insulation, we always had a plank that you could walk on while you were stapling the insulation together. And at that time--I think I was chewing tobacco, or had a cold, I don’t remember which one. But I just took a spit over my right shoulder and thought nothing of it. Got up to move and I stepped from the sheet steel onto the plank and that’s where the spit had landed. And it had froze. My foot hit that and both feet went out from under me, but luckily I straddled the plank. Dad and the owner of the hangar were walking below--good timing--right at the same time. And Dad hollered, “Headache.” That’s usually what they holler when somebody drops something from up above. Well, here it was me, I was dropping. But luckily, like I said, I straddled the plank and Dad hollered “Headache!” And I said, “BS.” And I said, “Butt ache.” LAUGHTER He looked up at me and just shook his head. But that was was lucky. If, you know, if I wouldn’t have straddled the plank, I would have been on the concrete. And that was probably the two scariest things that ever happened to me working on the steel. And sometimes I wonder why the good Lord was picking on me, but I think he was trying to train me. LAUGHS [So where was that, with the hangar, where you were working there?] I think that was in Marquette. 19:03 We were worked Marquette, Ishpeming, Peshtigo. No, I take it back. It was Peshtigo because we were crisscrossing the Wisconsin border in that little tip. Yeah, it was Peshtigo. But  the other one, like I said, was at White Pine. We worked out of Ontonagon. We stayed in Bergland, Michigan, when we were working White Pine. But in a year’s time, as far as I can remember, we probably had six different jobs. We subcontracted out of Iron Mountain through W.B. Thompson Company. And we built a electrical--I forget the name of it now but it was a building. In fact, I’ve seen a truck with that name on it, here, not too long ago. So that electric company is still in business in Iron Mountain. I’m just, I’m not bringing up the name right now but--that was one of the buildings we did. [This is likely M.J. Electric, headquartered in Iron Mountain, Michigan.] 20:26 We had some crazy guys working with us—it was just amazing. A lot of the boys were right from this area that we knew, or knew their families. And that worked out real well. We made a good team. Everybody was looking out for each other all the time. I worked for, maybe a year and a half, I don’t remember exactly now, but I remember thinking, you know--they always say if you decide what you’re going to do for the rest of your life, look at the fruit on the tree before you decide to go that way. And I remember thinking--when my hands were numb and I couldn’t pick up a screw, couldn’t pick up a drill, a lot of work you had to do without gloves on because you couldn’t, like screwing the sheeting down, you couldn’t hardly hold the screws with gloves on--I remember being that cold and, at the age of18, between 18 and 19, having hemorrhoids from sitting on the steel. And I’m thinking, this is the fruit on the tree. And I more or less right then decided I’m going in some other direction. LAUGHS And there’s ironworkers that have been doing this all of their lives, so I kind of wimped out. From that point on, I did the next best thing in my life. I joined the Marine Corps. LAUGHS Another rude awakening. 22:20 [You said you worked with some crazy guys...guys around here. Can you tell about some of them?] Well, one of them was Happy Hudak. And his family hailed right from Ashland. And--hmm...just a fun guy to be around. And he was a short, little, dark haired guy and he could climb steel like he was born to do it. And a good guy to get along with. Very reliable. And another fellow was Dave Tapani. And I know my dad and his dad worked together for a lot of years. And that’s the thing, once you’re in that venue, you run on to people repeatedly depending on where the job is and who was hired for. But you’d run into your old friends repeatedly. And I seen that trend going on there. Well, and Dave’s dad was Rudy and they lived over on Highway 13 about five miles south of Ashland. Another one was Jack Hudak, er, Jack Shubat. Now these are the guys who were on the crew in that year, year and a half that I worked there. He lived just up--south of Ashland on 112. Still lives out here. And all of these guys were probably 5-8 years older than me at that time so they’re pretty old now. Some of them started young. [Would you spell that?] Shubat. [Spelling confirmed through White Pages for Jack J. Shubat.] I don’t know. All I remember at that time was he had a great sense of humor and--the guys were always trying to get me lined up with girls. I was just 18, between 18 and 19 then and wasn’t much interested. But they were, I do remember one thing though—we, at night we liked to go out and have a few brewskies. And after working hard all day, a lot of times out  in the cold, two brewskies and I’d be gone. That would be enough for me as soon as that warm air hit me, especially after eating supper. And, you know, a lot of times we’d go out and eat steak. We ate real well. We had to because you burned it up the next day. I remember one time we went from--we were staying in Bergland, working at White Pine--and we drove back to Wakefield because we heard there was a wedding dance going on. Still don’t know whose it was. But we crashed it, got three sheets to the wind. We’re on the way back to Bergland and we were riding in Happy Hudak’s--it was a Ford that had the electronic trunk and the electronic convertible and pure white, just a beautiful car--and we got about half way back and got a flat tire. Well, it’s darker than the inside of a cat outside and everybody’s pretty gassed up. So we slept there until daybreak and got up woke up, and got the trunk open, and got the tire changed. We got back to Bergland for breakfast. And we walked into the little restaurant that we went to every morning. Dad was already finished eating and--we had just pounding headaches—and Dad got up and he said, “Anybody isn’t on the roof when the whistle blows can head ‘er down the road.” And he looks at my brother Larry and I and says, “Boys, you’ll be the first ones to go.” And we skipped breakfast that morning. We were on the roof when the whistle blew. And talk about a long day. It wasn’t worth the party. LAUGHTER That was one of Dad’s sayings too, that “If you can’t do it, you can’t stay.” 27:47 And I did see him have to fire a couple of guys and it wasn’t, it wasn’t a nice thing to see but they just couldn’t hack it. Hmm. One feller was given--well, he was new on the job--and he was given the simple job of cutting out gusset plates with a propane torch, or acetylene torch rather. And he was doing that next to the work shack and, Dad came back from the job site, and here the guy had the acetylene torch set wrong so it was smoking black. And he was kinda cutting half way through it and he was trying to beat the, the gusset plates with the back of the torch. And there were flames coming out of the torch all over the place. Gosh! Dad give him a warning, “You know, there’s a $300 torch head shot.” The next job he gave him was going over to the job site with a wire brush and a spud wrench that would fit the anchor bolts. And the job was to take away the brush and clean the cement residue out of the threads out of the anchor bolts. And run the nuts on and run them back off to make sure that they were ready to go, so that when the red iron got there, we were ready to stand it up, that there was no hold up with a crane sitting there. And we went to set the first, the first bent, which is the column on each side and... then a joist, two joist which make a bent, and two bents to a bay. So we’re setting up the first bent and we couldn’t get the lug nut, we couldn’t get the anchor bolts on. Well, it actually--one anchor bolt was twisted off and one the nut wouldn’t go on, so we had to quick brush that and get it anchored down. Well, that fella there got his walking papers because what he was doing was just running the nut on and taking that wrench and putting the pipe on it and trying to run the anchor bolts down and it was twisting them off. And it just caused a, it cost a lot of dollars to have that crane sitting there. Not only that, it was dangerous for the guys working it too. Everything was kind of in turmoil. So, yeah, he got his walking papers and--it ain’t a good thing to see. You can’t keep somebody on that can’t listen, because down the line somebody will get hurt or get killed.  31:10 [When you mentioned red iron... What does that mean?] That’s your structural steel. That’s just the framework. I’m forgetting my nomenclature on the stuff, but two columns and two joists make one frame. And that’s called a bent. Two of those make a bay. So if you’ve got four bays in a building, you’re going to have--eight or nine bents? Two, four, six, eight... [But the term red iron just refers to a girder or the length of....] Any of your frame steel, which would be a girder, which would be purlin, any of that stuff that ties all the frame together. It’s all painted with Rust-Oleum paint, which is mostly reddish brown. 32:23 [So when you were picking up the trade, was there any apprenticeship or you just sort of jumped in there?] Yeah [LAUGHS] you just jumped in. It was definitely on-the-job training and baptism by fire mostly. [Did you have a card then? Did you work out of a local?] I had a tinnerman’s card [i.e. a member of the Sheet Metal Worker’s International Association, a.k.a. “tinman” or “tin basher”]. I couldn’t get a ironworkers card until I did an apprenticeship. But they could get me in under a sheet metal men’s permit--and that’s how I got started, which is kinda crazy but it got me in there. We had--well, let’s see--from there we went, we went to the Marine Corps. Dad had asked me why I wanted to join the Marine Corps, and I was speaking out of no knowledge. I was speaking just from my heart. And at that time the Vietnam War was in full bloom. And I never gave it that much thought. There was so much controversy and bad information coming back to the United States--if any information or lack of. And Dad said, “Why the Marine Corps?” And I said, “Well, Dad, if I’m going to go into any service, I’m going into the best.” Not realizing that the best also puts you right in the front. I guess I didn’t think that far ahead. He says, “Yeah but why, why do you even want to do this?” And I said, “Dad”-- and this was on a road trip coming back home. And I knew, I knew he wanted my brother and I to be ironworkers. And carry on the family--I don’t know if it even a tradition--but carry on what he had taught us. And--I had made up my mind then--I’m not spending the rest of my life doing the steel construction, but I was very proud of, to have been involved in it and be able to do it. That was kind of a--you know, you’re up in the air and looking down at little people walking down below and--it gives you a sense of pride that you can do that kind of thing and be part of a good team and have them, have your team members, trust you. That was the other good thing about that. But as far as going into the Marine Corps, I told Dad, “Dad, I’ve had a good life and it’s time to just pay back some.” And being a country guy, he could understand that. Dad was always very patriotic. 36:17 [Let’s talk about your Dad a little bit. Do you know where your ancestors came from or how they got here to Northern Wisconsin? Could we even start further back?] Well, my Grandfather, Odin, lived at White River Hill. Even farther back than that, his Dad was Gottfried and they came from Norway, of course. They were Norwegian. And I didn’t know much about Great Grandpa, but Granddad Odin lived on White River Hill on Highway 112. Had a little, he was a Pentecostal minister and he had a congregation with a lot of local people. Some of the names that pop into my head were Hegstroms and Andersons and-- Rita, can you remember any more? [Asks his wife. She say, “What was that”?] The people involved in White River  Church? Well, there was a lot of them anyways throughout the years. And that was my very early childhood. I can remember that. I went to one service that sticks out in my mind in that little white church. We had a Black minister that particular Sunday. And the stage in that church was, like, one step up was just a six inch rise and then it had the old piano on it, and the pulpit. This Black minister had everybody just praising the Lord and actually it was kinda scary. A lot of folks crying and weeping and--they were making noise. They were making noise unto the Lord. But being just a little kid, it was kind of neat at the same time but it was kinda scary too. I thought to myself. Some of these people are really suffering here. And that’s about all I can remember about that. But we still have the paperwork and stuff from the church and--the Church is long gone now. I did salvage some of the ceiling tile and wall tile and some of the things out of it to do my addition here on the place. 40:02 That one time, Rita and I had it in our minds to make the church property a family reunion place. And by that time, the church was already sinking into the ground. The wooden floor was rotted away but it could still be salvaged but it would take some money and some time. Well, back in our early years of marriage, we didn’t have any money. We had kids. We had diapers. No money. And so my sister Jody sent letters to all of our relatives and we sent out about 40 letters and got not one response back. So that kind of squashed that whole idea. So eventually, the old church went, got sold to a guy for the cost of the taxes and the property was such a small piece of property that you couldn’t build on it. The guy that bought it was burning brush one day and it burned the church down. LAUGHS And that ended the church. 41:27 Then getting back to our heritage, then my mom’s folks hailed from down around Greenwood and Thorpe, Wisconsin. Grandpa was a horse trader, horse farmer. And a big burly barrel-chested guy. Had a great big bushy eyebrows and I always thought that was pretty cool until I grew ‘em. LAUGHS And Grandma was a stout farm lady. Had a big, she had a big ol’ bulge on her right arm, on the backside of her bicep where she had been bitten by a horse. Back in the day, you got whatever treatment there was and apparently there wasn’t much. And it just grew into a big lump on her arm but I remember that about her. And she was ambidextrous. LAUGHS If you were being bad, she could really smack you with either hand just as well. LAUGHS And a lot of times she would, she would feint with a right and give you a left, but she was a kind hearted person. But stern. And Grandpa was stern. Both had very good senses of humor. [What were their names?] Grandpa’s name was Fred, Francis, and Grandma was Charlotte. Years later--well they lived in a house that had no electricity and I can still smell the kerosene lamps, and the wood stove--and we were there in the wintertime, getting close to Christmas, I remember looking in their windowsill and I thought it was so cool. I was probably...maybe 6 or 7 at that time. They had these little Christmas tree ornaments in the window that were kind of like a fuller brush texture to ‘em with little dots of glue at the ends of the branches and they looked so real to me that I thought that was really neat. And I heard from out in the kitchen, “Don’t touch those.” So they were still neat but had to look at them from a distance. LAUGHS I think a year or so later, my folks decided that Grandma and Gramps had  to let the farm go. They were totally destitute and the house had, other than wood heat, had no heat. So they came to live with us. And that was great. That was great having them there. And we just moved over and made room for ‘em. It was good having ‘em in our house. And then a couple of years later, one of my aunts from Oregon decided they needed a warmer climate so they moved them to Oregon after much turmoil and sadness. Well, that’s where they ended up dying, was out there. So eleven years later, my brother and I talked my folks into giving us airfare to go out there. And eleven years later, we went to visit Grandpa. Grandma had already passed on. Grandpa was in a nursing home in Medford, Oregon. So my brother and I ended up out there, found the nursing home. We stayed with the same aunt and uncle that took them out there. And we went to see Grandpa and here we are, 17-18 years old and Grandpa recognizes us as soon as we walk in. While he was in the nursing home, he had cancer on one leg and they amputated that. But we got to have lunch with him and had a great visit. And my brother came back home and, well, . . . 46:35 We knocked around Oregon for a little while and we were running short on money so I got a job working for Edward Hines Lumber Company. And earned enough money to ship Larry back home, my older brother, and I stayed on until almost Christmastime. And that was a good experience, working in that huge lumbar company. And like our lumber companies around here, they’ll have a big log out in the front with their name on it or some logo on it or something. And I thought ours were pretty big logs. They were like four foot through the middle. But the one they had in front of Edward Hines Lumber Company, it was more like 16 feet through the middle. I stood on the end of it and held my hand as high as I could with my fingers touching the heart of the log. That’s--it was just tremendous. And see these big logs come and start spinning on the lathe. They would spin and throw cold air throughout the whole building, they would fan so much. And it was tremendous just watching that happening. I don’t know how many thousands of feet they would get off of one log but it was a lot. And I remember one time- -I got along with the foreman pretty well. I was doing all of the back breaking scrub work that nobody else would do, which was ok. I was used to that. He put me in one room where all of the conveyor belts converged and it was, it was like 6 feet deep with saw dust. And it smelled like a calf pen. I mean it was, it had been in there for a long time. And he sent me in there to clean it up. I looked at it and I thought, “This ain’t so bad.” There were conveyors running every which way. All you gotta do is put it on a conveyor and it’s gone. It’s not like you have to load it and haul it and take it someplace. By the end of my shift that night, I was sweeping the floor in there. And the foreman came in and just shook his head. And he said, “I have put I don’t know how many guys in this room and you are the first one that ever stayed and did it. All the rest of ‘em said ‘I’m outa here.’ That’s amazing.” He said, “Where do you want to be placed?” And I said, “I want to work on the green chain.” And up until that point, I had cleaned under the green chain, pulling all the bark and slabs and everything that falls underneath it-- which was a mean job because it was too low to stand up under and it was too high to, it was just high enough that everything you did was on your hands and knees were just kind of half bent so it was hard on the back. But I got that done. Well, he put me on the green chain. And at that  time, I was chewing tobacco. Well, on the green chain, you’re pulling veneer and you’ll have sometimes one size that you pull on each side, like a 36 inch piece or a, sometimes two sizes. You’ll have 18 on one side and a 36 on the other side. And you’d have a cart on each side of you and that’s your job, is to pull your size veneer when it comes down the conveyor. That was gravy work as far as I was concerned. I loved it. But I had one bad thing. I was chewing tobacco and I never, never could swallow tobacco and I would salivate so bad. And--but working on a green chain, you can spit wherever you want to. Well, I was spitting on veneer as it went by. And the foreman came over to me one night and he says, “You know, that knotter is really, really punching out more knots than it should be. This stuff doesn’t have that many knots. You’re going to have to quit spitting on that veneer.” LAUGHTER And what it would do it would chop out every place I spit and put a plug in there. Well then it would downgrade the quality of the veneer. And so I had to quit chewing tobacco. So that was the end of my tobacco habit. LAUGHS [In other words the punch on the knotter was hooked to a photosensitive device that mistook the dark tobacco stain for a knot in the wood.] 51:15 [Can up tell...hmm...when you moved here and your Dad... Could you tell when and where he was born and how he got into the trade or what you know about him as an ironworker?] Dad was born on White River Hill again in 1925. And Grandpa had a little farm going there, too, so he could kinda see the trend. And Grandpa also built his own or made his own cement blocks and built his dairy barn. Probably one of the first ones in the area that actually had a cement foundation. By the time I was old enough to recollect anything, that barn was long gone so I never did get to see it. But I did get to see Grandpa making cement blocks and that carried on into Dad making cement blocks too. And the place we’re on right now, still has a few of the blocks around here. Actually the addition on the back of the garage is cement blocks. The whole garage is cinder blocks but the, the addition in the back is cement blocks and that’s some of the ones that Dad and Grandpa had made. And Dad bought this place. Well, to get back to... After Dad became old enough to get out on his own, he hitchhiked out to the West Coast and went to work as a welder in the ship yards. And jumping way ahead, that ultimately led to Dad’s death with asbestos poisoning. All those years, he carried asbestos in his body and eventually it caused cancer and took him out of the picture. After he came back from the ship yard work out there . . . 54:02 Another name popped into my head too. Willy Butler was another guy that did Dad did steel with. Ross Watson was another one, but that was some of the older guys that--I worked with Ross one time at one of the jobs. But those two fellas, Dad worked American Bridge with and they worked the grain elevators up in Superior. Now Ross was on a job, I don’t remember if it was in Michigan, but I wasn’t in the construction then, but he was injured on the job. A crane operator had, through miscommunication on the walkies or radios or whatever they used then, he had two-blocked his pulley on the crane and snapped it. And it came down and clubbed Ross in the shoulder, broke his shoulder. And a little bit over it would have just smashed him, but  anyway it was kind of a glancing blow but it broke his shoulder. [The block came down? That’s what came down?] The pulley came down. [The pulley...yeah.] The pulley. Yup. And that-- eventually when Ross was on the mending stage, he ended up getting cancer--and that took him out of the picture. But I do remember Dad going and sitting with him and, you know, just being by him. That’s all you can do when somebody is dying with cancer. That’s all you can do is be with them. Even if you don’t say anything, just be there. And that’s probably one of the hardest things there is to do. [I did it with my Mom for a long time.] Yeah. You can’t talk about the future because there isn’t any. You can talk about the past but it’s bittersweet. So you just sit there. Cribbage comes in real handy. LAUGHS 56:48 Well, Dad worked in the American Bridge Union for a number of years. Now this was before. This was before us kids were old enough to really know too much about that. And, you know, he’d tell us about it in retrospect, but climbing very, very high steel and doing that, you know? But I think that was, if not the way he got started in steelwork, it was part of it. It just moved on to doing his own, doing his own business. I remember Dad hiring a tax man, L. Peterson, to help him figure out his taxes when he started our own company, the Olby Erection Company. When Dad came home on the weekends from one of the job sites, he would spend the whole weekend in the little office out here doing taxes, figuring out how to do taxes. And I think that was harder on him than, than actually doing the work or being the boss. Figuring out the taxes and coming out at the end of the year. And I know just from what I seen at this place that we didn’t get rich doing that. 58:26 [When he worked in the ship yards, do you know where that was?] It was in California some place. [I know they had them in San Francisco, ship yards.] I never knew much about that. He never talked about any of it. [I have an old friend who started in the ship yards in San Francisco in the late 30s and he lived with asbestos.] Yeah, it was a common thing. All the pipes are wrapped with it. And now if they find one pipe with it, they call in the clean up team and, you know. They’ll have special suits and special masks and probably air tanks on them and everything else. And find one ceiling tile in a high school or something that has it. LAUGHS 59:18 [What can you tell me about this song here, “Ironworker Blues”?] Well, you know--and after you and I talked a number of times, I got looking in our closet. There’s a book. Dad had written more songs than I even knew. Unfortunately, they don’t have any music with them but there’s like 20 some songs in there that. This particular one I got to be part of, whether I wanted to or not. That’s the way we did things. LAUGHS Back to the old, “If you can’t do it you can’t stay.” LAUGHS So Dad had a little band here, well, over the years, he probably had two or three different ones as people would join and then as life went on, something would take them away. But it was amazing how many people would come out of the closet that were talented that played different instruments or had great voices and just giving them an opportunity to be part of this. They would just show up. I remember one guy came here had a, he was playing a French horn and he was good on it. But Dad said, “Well, we’re kind of doing the country western theme and a French horn just doesn’t quite get it.” LAUGHS “But can you sing?” And he said, “No,  I don’t sing.” And Dad says, “I’m sorry but you’re welcome to stay and you’re welcome to come back anytime you want to but we just don’t have a place for a French horn.” LAUGHS Let him down pretty easy. We had a lot of people like that that would show up and some of them would claim they could sing and some of them couldn’t. But every once in a while, they’d come along and be great on the piano or great on the guitar or do all of them. [Accordion too?] A little bit on the accordion, yeah. Dad made me learn two songs on the accordion and...my heart wasn’t in it. You can’t play any instrument or sing if your heart wasn’t it in. Mine wasn’t. So I struggled through two songs. Back then I was looking at all the accordion players I knew were either doing the oompa-pa polkas or schottisches or--and non-stop. And I’m watching these little old guys up on the stage, pumping that according, and going for 4-5 hours straight... I thought, that’s no place for me. I don’t want to do that. LAUGHS And like I said, my heart wasn’t in it so I just let go of it. I practiced enough to learn two songs and enough to keep Dad off my back and that was about it. And I let that go. But I did the drums a little bit and learned to play harmonica... So I had my little niche in there. 1:02:48 But getting back to this song, we did this right in the garage on this place. And we had 4-5 people in the group then that [Asks his wife: Do you remember who was in the group when we did that? DOG BARKING] Brian’s here, he’s excited [David’s son-in-law and daughter arrive, exciting the dog]. Rita, was Butch and Junior still in then? R: I believe so. D: Yeah, because Butch was doing the rhythm guitar and I think his brother, Junior, was still alive. Junior sang like Johnny Horton. Had a great, great voice. And I think he was only like 56 or something when he was working out in Oregon or California. And dropped dead right at work. Heart attack. Way to go. It was like bam, down he went and that was it. But at that time, I’m thinking that Butch Green, his real name was Alvin, he played rhythm bass and Junior, which was Frank Green, played lead guitar and sang like Johnny Horton. I mean, he did “Whispering Pines” and “The Mansion You Stole” and all those songs, right to a T. We went out and did shows for the fair and different occasions. He was a big hit. He did real well. And Butch mastered the Johnny Cash type rhythm on his guitar so whenever we did some of Johnny Cash’s stuff, like “Folsom Prison” or any of those, Butch could just knock that right out. He was great. 1:05:36 But getting back to this song--and there was probably two or three other people involved that my old memory ain’t bringing it up right now--but right in the garage, repeatedly, repeatedly, repeatedly, we did this song over and over and over again until Dad thought it was good enough. And I think this particular song, he only had like 125 copies made. And one other one he did was “Beyond those City Lights” and “Go Then” was the flip side of it. And he only had like 25 of those made. And we’ve lost them someplace. I know he got a lot away. All the taverns around this area had them on their jukeboxes and that was pretty novel. But somehow or another, we ended up with not one copy of that one that I can find. But this one here, actually I can say I was honored to live part of this, and suffered through some of it. And I had a feeling, you know, [begins to read lyrics from “Iron Worker Blues”] “You sit way up there in the sky and you watch birds go flying by,” and all of that’s true. You do. And sometimes you wonder why  things have turned out the way they are and why you’re there. And if you ponder on it when your hands are cold and shivering, yeah, you can get the blues pretty easy. End of the day, you’re about froze to death: “You wait for the boss to say come down” and [reads but doesn’t speak the next line: “You wait for a job that’s on the ground.”] 1:07:19 Once in a while you do get a job that’s on the ground. We had a job, in between jobs I guess you could say, it was a wintertime job and they needed to replace the—now this was back in White Pine--in the wheel house that we built, they had these big cable drums that would wind up the cable that brought the bucket up out of the mine shaft. And on each cable drum—I mean these things were huge--on each cable drum there was a sleeve that went on ‘em that was grooved. So they would start the cable out in the grooves and it would make the cable travel and follow itself over so it would wind evenly. And we had—I think the millwrights were on strike so we kind of snuck in there and got this job. It paid very well but, boy, we ruined a lot of clothes with that millwright oil. Oh man that stuff would stink. Drill oil. And that was our one on the ground job that I can remember that paid real well. It wasn’t that bad of a job. It was warm. Mostly cutting torching, getting the old sleeves off and getting ready for the new ones. And that was probably a three week job and that was--we had a deadline on that one--so it was kinda under the gun. We had to move on it. 1:09:03 Like any place, you get paid every two weeks. “You wait for pay day to roll around.” And by that time you’re, by the time you pay everything off, you’re pretty broke. But back then, my brother and I were making $5.10 an hour, and we were making good money. [I was making a buck and a quarter an hour then.] Yup. And like down at the mill in Mellon, it was $1.33 after you were there a year. But back then, gas was like 32 cents a gallon. You didn’t need a big pile of money to make ends meet either so $5.10 an hour was pretty nice. And then we had to pay our union dues out of that and constantly wearing out clothes and trying to buy a better grade of tools and paying off the bar bill and food expenses and--lucky we had Mom home here to take care of our clothes. Unfortunately, looking back at it, I don’t think I ever left any change in my pocket even but she always took care of us. Anyway, that was waiting “for pay day to roll around.” So it hasn’t changed much. 1:10:33 “You hook a choker around the beam” is the start of the next verse here. And that’s to swing them into place. A choker is a cable with a loop on each end. One loop hooks to the hook on the crane, the headache ball on the crane. And basically all you’re going to do is putting a slip knot on the beam. If you don’t get it right in the center and the crane starts to lift the beam and it will slide to one side or the other and possibly drop out. And that’s what the next verse here, “The choker slips and the pusher screams.” The pusher is the guy on the ground, usually highballing the crane operator. So the crane operator has to set it back down and he goes to center the choker again and re-lift it. And having someone barking at you could make you mean, or just having to re-do things--that gets at you after a while. [This refers to the lyric “It’s sure enough to make you mean.”] “You put your spud wrench in the hole.” Now your spud wrench is a long wrench with like a rat tail end on it so you can align the red iron and put a bolt through  it. Because most of this, all the red iron is prefabricated and a lot of times it doesn’t line up and you, you know, when you’re stretching this building, sometimes the whole framework to make that one hole fit, that helps square the building up a lot of the times. Sometimes the hole is just in the wrong place and then you gotta bring a torch up and make your own hole. But that’s what the spud wrench is. You stick it in the hole and pry the two holes together and then the next hole over, you stick a bolt in it and tighten it down. So you’re doing all of this with two hands, so you’re holding the spud wrench with your shoulder, holding it in place, and you stick a bolt in the hole. And for some reason or another, the nut doesn’t want to spin on ‘er like it should so you holler for somebody to “hold the roll.” And that’s what that means. And he holds that bolt from rolling while you’re running the nut on. And usually that . . . 1:13:14 . . . Well, going back to my first duty, on my first job, was to sit outside the work shack. I had a bag of bolts on one side and a bag of nuts on the other side. And I would thread nuts and bolts together. Thread nuts and bolts together. Thread nuts and bolts together and throw them in another bucket. And that’s the ones you’d take up in your work apron so you’d have both parts together. And I did that like for two days. I was ready to go crazy but I made it through that tough test. 01:13:56 Now we’re talking about, “You put your spud wrench in the hole.” Ok. That’s what we did. Someone hollers, “Hold the roll.” Stop that bolt from spinning. Tighten it up. So you’re doing all of this with your shoulder and two hands and you still need help. Luckily, there’s somebody close to you that can skid ‘er over and give you a hand with that, while you’re hanging there. And the next verse here, “You take the rod wrench from your hip.” Now you’re doing a different kind of steel construction here. You’re rod tying. You’re tying rod together, reinforcing rod. And to get this to stay in place while they’re pouring concrete over it, you gotta wire-tie it. I got fairly decent at it so I could get it done. There was guys that were just totally on fire on this. They could tie four times faster than me. And what you would do is you had a roll of wire in a carrier on your hip. And your rod wrench was your side cutter pliers. And you’d cut a strand of wire, wrap it around the intersection of the two reinforcing rods and you’d give it a couple of wraps and then you would twist it so it would stay in place. And as you’re twisting it, to keep one side of the twist from breaking, you always had to pull up on it and twist, pull up on it and twist. And what he’s talking about here is if your rod wrench slips while you’re pulling up on that, you’re pulling it up hard and it would come up and whack yourself in the chin. And “It’s enough to make you quit.” LAUGHS So you just keep doing it with your lip smarting. LAUGHS Or you drop that wrench down the hole too and that’s a goner because you can’t get through the reinforcing rod to get down and get it. It’s gone. So you try not to drop that one. “Seems like you can’t never gain. It’s either got to snow or rain. Where you get so cold you feel no pain. And you get them ironworkers blues.” Got that cold. Lived it, did it. Part of the reason I joined the Marine Corps. LAUGHS 01:16:30 “They let you work eight hours a day.” See, there’s guys that would work longer than that. But, belonging to the union, you’ve got to watch ‘er. So sometimes it feels like you’re  limited to where you have a little bit of energy you want to burn up yet and you’re getting to a point in the job where you want to finish what you’re doing, move on to something the next day. But you still have to punch out when the whistle blows. So then here you are. “But you’re so darn broke you gotta stay.” On and on we go. “On Friday night you’re on your way, with dirty clothes and only half your pay. You know darn well what Ma’s gonna say.” Yup. I had ‘em. I had them ironworkers’ blues. I was only there for a year and a half. LAUGHS [It’s a fantastic song and you did a really great job. LAUGHTER ] “Ironworkers Lament” too...I tell you what. [Yeah, that was another great song.] That was great. [That’s another thing. That’s a good song. I haven’t yet found out who this guy is. I’ve got a couple of angles I need to pursue.] Well, I tell you what, that guy would have fit into that group here, right now. He had a great voice. He had a great voice. [A little bantering ensues as David’s daughter and son-in-law are leaving.] 1:18:20 [Well, the last thing I wanted to know is... You told me that you were one of the performers in that...] Oh yeah, I was the guy, if I belonged to an orchestra, I don’t know what instrument would make that noise--or a band. LAUGHS In this case it was the acetylene tank or the oxygen tank on the acetylene torches. Dad wanted a sound that sounded like somebody pounding on a beam, driving a wedge, or driving it into place but he didn’t want it in synch with the rhythm of the song. He wanted it to sound natural. Probably the only time in my life I kept falling into rhythm and he was getting so mad at me. LAUGHS “No, we don’t want it in rhythm,” he would say. All right, all right, all right. So they would start the whole thing over again because Dave was screwing up, you know? And I had to concentrate on, you know, on not going in rhythm. This is kind of funny because all the time Dad’s performing and running the little band. He’s always going, snapping his fingers or doing something to snap his wrists to keep us in rhythm and then all of a sudden [LAUGHS] he wants to go the other way and don’t get in rhythm. It was a struggle. It was just funny. That was so many good years and so many faces and people that have, jump into my mind, intermittently, and a lot of them I can’t remember the names anymore. There were so, so many. And a lot of them were just neighbor people through the Mason, Ashland, Bayfield County area that would just come to the barn dances and, you know, after you’ve had a couple of sarsaparilla sometimes they’d get enough courage to get up on the stage and they’d blow us away. It was amazing what they could do. Like all these little band members searching for a band. They’d come out of the woodwork and it was totally amazing. [I think I have what I needed which was great storytelling. Love the detail.]
Ironworkers;William C. “Bill” Tanneberg;0:05 Announcement, initial question–when and where born, how you got into ironworkers trade? 0:40 I was born and raised in Ashland, Wisconsin. And when the powder plant down here started [on Highway 12 in Sauk County, north of Sauk City and south of Baraboo], my dad come down here to work down here at the powder plant. I lived here practically all my life. Have lived in Ashland for awhile. I lived up on the Iron Range [MN] for awhile. I was working in a, working iron up there. So I know all about the mines. And I worked the Great Lakes on the ore carriers carrying the iron ore down to the steel mills. So I’m pretty well acquainted with the process of steel. And then I got in the ironworking trade mid-sixties (1960s) and I’ve worked in it ever since. I’ve been to the east coast and the west coast, San Francisco, all over working. I’ve been on the ground, and I’ve been 1400 feet in the air on TV towers. In fact the one tower outfit wanted me to travel with them. But I didn’t. Pretty well acquainted with all facets of the trade. Then I went to a [metal] fabricator’s show about 13-14 years ago. Out in New Mexico. We went on a tour from there to a blacksmithing shop, and I fell in love with the blacksmith trade. Been doing it ever since. I’ve just really, really grown. Matter of fact, the guy that introduced me to it–I seen him up at La Crosse in “02–he said I’m doing a heck of a job. Just keep it up. 3:34 [Year born?] 1939. [What was your Dad’s name?] Same as mine. [Was it after WWII they moved to southern WI?] Yeah. 1942. [What years did you work up on the Iron Range?] Early 70s. [How did you happen to get up there on the Range?] There was no work down here then so... The Iron Range started boom like heck so, yeah... So I went up there. [What were you doing when you were on the Range? Were you constructing...] Yeah, constructing and expanding plants. [How did you happen to get into it? How did you find out about the ironworkers trade?] I knew a lot of ironworkers. I was a laborer for a couple of years in. I ran around with guys who knew what it was and I had a chance to getting in the trade. [Can you remember some of the guys...or who did you start out working with?] JP Cullen and Jimmy Pintz, Buell Cuff, those guys. [What kind of work did you do starting out as an ironworker?] Re-rod. [Welding?] Right, right. [How did you pick up some of those particular skills...?] Just started doing it. 6:15 [Did anyone give you tips?] Oh yeah. [Can you tell me a little bit about that?] Let me think about that. I was working for Cullen...I pushed a lot of work for them, especially re-rodding. Jimmy Pintz said, “The office wants to talk to you. And I said, “Should I talk to them?” And he said, “Well, we want you to go down...to this job in Michigan. We want you to run that for us.” So I went down there. Monday morning, this guy said, “Well, I’m the foreman.” “Well, the office sent me down here and I’m supposed to take over.” So he quit and the guy working with him quit. So here I am all by myself. Big strapping laborer says, “I’ll help you out, Shorty.” So I called the Milwaukee Hall and they said, “You can’t put him to work. Ask if he wants an apprenticeship.” And he said “yup”... So I put him to work and signed him up. We finished that job up, you know. Then I went down to Rockford. There was a high rise down there. I was pretty well set up with Cullen. [Were they good to work with?] Oh yes they were. [How many years did you work with Cullen?] Probably eight years steady. [And was it places like Michigan, Northern Illinois...] Yup. [Were you in Wisconsin too?] Oh yeah. Ashland, Rochester, MN, for Cullen. Traveled quite a bit for them. [What were they building?] Elderly housing. High rises. [How many years did you work before you became a foreman?] Hmm... Probably 4 years at the most. [You mentioned working in San Francisco. Did you boom out to those places?] Yeah, yeah. I worked quite a bit down in Rockford too, at the Chevrolet plant. They needed help down there. The B.A. down there always gave me a call. “Come on down, Shorty. We need you down here.” I went down there right away. [How did you get out to San Francisco?] There was no work around here so I called out there and yup, we got work. I worked out there for two years. [Bridge work or high rise work?] Well, it was high rise work. That was in the 70s. 11:06 [Did you meet any of those old timers like Al Zampa and others who worked on the Golden Gate bridge?] I don’t remember. 11:23 [Shorty, that’s what they called you?] Yeah. [Did other guys have nicknames on the job?]  Most of them usually do. [Can you think of some of them?] Most of them usually do. PAUSE Buffalo Bob. LAUGHS Yeah... [Was he a character...?] PAUSE Always bragging what he could do and stuff like that. We called him “buffalo” because he always buffaloed his way through stuff. LAUGHS [When I was a kid in the 50s...there was the Howdy Doody Show with Buffalo Bob. He was a big bullshitter.] Yup. [At what point did you work at the Great Lakes?] Well, when I was 18-21. [You said that it would have been between Duluth and Gary, Indiana or where did you go?] The whole Great Lakes. Duluth, Superior, Taconite Harbor, Cleveland, Toledo, Buffalo, New York, Ashtabula. [Did you work with Fins on a boat?] I don’t remember. I was in the engine room, running the engine. I had got certified papers to run the engines, maintain them. [Probably noisy, eh?] Yeah, noisy. I remember one time we were anchored out from Port Huron in the river... Captain rings back, we’re taking off. Daniel Morrell was ahead of us. She pulled anchor, she’s going. So we followed her out. An hour later, he tells us that we’re going to the river. Daniel Morrell just sunk. [Whoa... That was in Lake Superior?] Lake Huron. [Oh... It was rough weather then?] Oh yeah. [I have some friends who live in Rogers City...right on the...] Yup. I know where its at. [Note: Daniel J. Morrell, Great Lakes freighter ... sunk on Lake Huron on 29 November 1966, taking with it 28 of its 29 crewmen.] 15:26 [Did you have any close calls as an ironworker?] No, not really. [Any accidents?] No. [Did you see a few?] Not really. Guys I worked with were pretty safe. 15:55 [So what part of the trade did you like the most?] Rigging and erecting. [You had to have a pretty good gang to have things run smoothly.] Yup. [Did you have any particular good guys you worked with who were really skilled...your ground men or connectors...or what have you?] Well...most of them were pretty good. [Good operating engineers?] Oh yeah. Oh yeah. I did have one accident. Out at Truax, we picking some heavy stuff up. It was such big sheeting on this one building. Like I told the foreman, “It’s not very safe doing it this way.” “Oh yeah, we’ll do it.” And a whole piece broke loose. Hit my left foot. Almost took my toes off. The operator baled out of his rig right away and came over to me. Even he said it was unsafe the way they were doing it. 18:08 [Wet weather was pretty tough too then.] Wet and cold. [Did you work all times of the year?] Oh yeah, oh yeah. [Any memories of particular cold or hot or... Did you experience with extreme weather?] Not really. PAUSE 19:00 [Sometimes the iron workers have conflicts with other trades. Did you ever get into it with the carpenters or...?] No, no. PAUSE No, not really. 19:25 [You mentioned that one place in New Mexico... When was that?] In 1997 I think. [And what kind of work did you do with the blacksmiths?] Well...all kinds of stuff. I started with railings. I like making headboards for beds and stuff. Some pretty fancy stuff. [Is there some connection between the ornamental part of the ironworkers trade and what you’re doing now?] Well, in a way, yeah. [Could you say a little more about that?] In ornamental work the stairwells and railings were done by the fabricating shop and installed by ironworkers, where a blacksmith uses a forge and power hammers and stuff. Shape all the stuff that way. You build jigs up to be able to bend stuff.  21:30 [When you were active as an ironworker, did you ever make or modify some of the tools? Spud wrench or a sleemer bar or...] No, not really. I think some guys have done different things.] I suppose, yeah. [...get their hands...] Yeah. [Some guys would use the stuff, maybe some rolled piece, and put their names on it.] Oh yeah. [Did you do anything like that?] Oh yeah. You usually mark all your own tools. [So do you have any of those around so you could show me at some point? Some of your old tools that are marked with your symbol?] I don’t know. Not really, I don’t think. No. The blacksmith, you know, you’ve got... They’ve got a stamp, called a touch mark. You hammer that into your metal. Mine is two Christmas trees on a hill, which means Christmas Hill, that’s what my last name means in German. [Oh yeah, oh tannebaum...] Yeah. And “berg” is hill. [Yeah. That’s the name of your street here too, right?] Yeah, right. [I saw that coming in. I hadn’t thought of that. That’s cool.] 23:32 [So the blacksmith work... Do you have any particular customers...people you worked for or do things for now?] Oh, there’s one famous...blacksmith and teacher... He’s dead now. He always said, “The forge is for the general, not the general public.” LAUGHTER Because the general public wants the stuff for nothing. These candle holders, I’m making now, there’s some in the house. One woman said, “Well, they’re worth $25 aren’t they?” For three hours labor? Please...please. Insult. [Did you find a few generals around or do you end up making them mostly for yourself?] I’m still looking. It’s coming. It’s coming. I sold the headboards I got. The cheapest one I got was for $4,000. Some of these headboards take 100-200 hours just to make them. And all my work. They are original. I didn’t copy nobody. [And this is steel?] Oh yeah, steel, copper, brass...and in the winter time when it’s too cold to work out here, I’m getting started at forging gold and silver which... Copper now...when you forge that, you heat this stuff up in the forge, throw it in cold water, whereas iron, I’ll heat it up and throw in cold water. Iron heated up throwing cold water in, it hardens the stuff. With copper, it softens it. So as you hammer it, it gets hard again. [Interesting stuff. I remember about iron in a foundry... would be more brittle.] Right, right right. [And also we had ladles as you heated it up. And the guys working it... The ladles had to warmed up] Wow... [Guy didn’t warm the ladles and the steel bounced and hit me right in the eyes. I thought I was going to go blind.] I bet. [But I came out of it alright.] Yeah. Well... The iron, if you heat it up...you put it in vermiculite until it cools off. Then it’s pliable as heck. [Really.] 27:27 [So where do you get your... metals? ] All over. Different suppliers. [Some of it is scrap too?] Some of it is, yeah. I sold pop cans at a junk yard down in Madison, walked in the scale house to weigh the cans. There were two four foot by six foot sheets of quarter inch copper...that was about 8 years ago. I snapped them up immediately. They were worth about 5 times what I paid for them. What someone else’s scrap is not scrap. [That’s right.] 28:35 [You said that you started as an ironworker in the 60s. At what point did you retire from the trade?] I retired June 5, 2008. My wife says, “Retire and stay home with me. Two days later she died. Two days later. I sure miss that lady. We did everything together. Everything. [That’s really hard.] It’s a bitch. [So the iron keeps you busy.] Yeah. [Leary offers sympathy about being on your own.] Yeah. 30:18 [So do you get together with old ironworkers now and then?] At the meetings and stuff, yeah... I go to quite a few. Lots of blacksmith conventions. I have a lot of friends there, an  awful lot of friends. [That’s cool. Leary talks about a blacksmith in Brill, WI, and also about another one who worked in Waunakee and lived on the east side of Madison.] Damascus. [Damascus.] Yeah. Pound and weld, pound and weld. Oh... That was... That’s the oldest type of welding there is, done by a blacksmith using Damascus steel. Six layers of steel, at different times... You put borax on it, heat it up and where it starts running, pound it. After it’s pounded, you split it in half and do the same thing. So you when you’re through, before you know it, you have 600 layers of steel, all pounded together, before its welded. [Strong stuff.] Yup. People think the price of this stuff is already high. Damascus...many hours pounded that stuff together. 33:16 [So when you look at that, what do you think of the trade of the ironworker? What would you like to say about it?] Its one of the best there is. Yup. [What did you like about it?] Variation of work. Always keep busy. [You did a little bit of everything?] Oh yeah...yeah... Y up. 34:00 [I think you mentioned rigging as one of your favorite things?] Yup. [What was it about that? Was it rigging cables on crane or...?] Taking heavy equipment and stuff up. Real heavy machinery. [So...could you describe it with a particular job that you had to do riggings that were challenges or... I haven’t really seen it in action so I have to imagine it.] These taconite mills, a lot of the stuff there were these balling drums, all heavy stuff. Really heavy. They had probably 3 inch cables that they were working with. [With a crane?] Oh yeah. All big stuff. [So how do you get the heavy equipment like that... Are there places built in that you can grab on to the cable?] Well, you see, there are usually picking eyes on the stuff. Loops (?) welded on the side of it. Picking eye...that’s what they called it. [Kind of like an eye bolt on the side for a way to pick it up?] It’s a piece of steel that is welded to the piece. Put a heavy shackle through that. 36:28 I liked working on TV towers too. The first tower I was on, the guy said, “You gotta go up in the air?” And I said, “Why not, what the heck. That’s part of my job, ain’t it? No problem.” So they had this picking boom on the side of the tower. It was a piece of the tower, you put it in place, bolt it in place. Then you jumped the picking boom on the tower on to the next one, keep on jumping it up. This was a utility tower out of Kansas City. [Leary talks about Tinker Nelson building WKOW TV tower also worked on it in the 60s. It’s pretty cool. He’s up there holding a camera with one hand and holding on to something else. He’s riding the heavy ball down.] Right, right, right. That’s how you get up there. [Tell me about that.] Then you have a special safety belt that you sit in. It’s more than a belt. It’s a whole harness and stuff. [when I saw this film and what some of these guys did, just wearing T-shirts. They weren’t wearing hard hats, things like that.] Nope. [How did it used to be then?] The same way. Yup. 38:45 [So what did you think when OSHA came in?] Some of it was good and some of it is a bunch of bullshit. [Like what?] Well, some of the regulations are fine and dandy but to me it should be up to that individual, what he considers safe and nonsafe. [Where the requirements you had actually more dangerous when OSHA came in?] I don’t know. Government, government, government...I don’t know. LAUGHS [Well, they would’ve shut down the foundry I was working on.] Right, right. I know.
Ironworkers;Augustine “Gus” Peplinski;0:05 [As the recorder comes on Gus starts showing some photographs of his dad, himself, brother, son, and nephew.] All ironworkers. 212 years total, to date. 0:34 Announcement, initial question modified to ask about Gus’s dad and how he got into the ironworkers trade? 1:00 Well he was born just out of Stockton [Portage County, WI], 1903. I don’t know, he lived there until my grandpa bought the farm, just north of Fancher Church here, on 6th Street off of County Trunk K. And he moved there. And that’s where I was born. Well, our whole family was born there. My sister and two brothers. And actually when he got into the trade I’m not sure. I think he started somewheres in the “30s, but he didn’t get a book till I believe it was 1941, according to what I got here. And then he went on the road. During the war time, projects. He went bumming for about five years. We lived in Kansas, Illinois, following the work. Basically I think it was under World War II projects and stuff. And then we come back here. Well, my grandpa got burnt on the farm, that was in 1946. That’s when my dad come back to the farm. We lived on the farm there ever since that. 2:25 I went to Amherst High School and graduated in 1954. I started ironwork with my Dad, Buren Powerhouse in 1957, January. Got my book in April 23, 1957. I’ll have 55 years coming this April. [What was your Dad’s name?] Leon Peplinski. [And did he have brothers who were also ironworkers?] No, he was the only one who was an ironworker. He had three other brothers and three sisters. [When you were a kid, traveling around with your dad, did you have much of an impression at that time what it was to be an ironworker? Did your dad show you things?] No, not really. I never got involved in part of his work or anything. He never took us out to the job sites or anything. One thing I do remember... We lived down by Baraboo and he would bring me a box of worms from work so I could go fishing in the Baraboo River. I was in the second grade I think. I remember that very well. [He was working on the power plant then.] Yeah, Badger Ordinance. 4:08 [What inspired you to get into the trade yourself?] My Dad got me into it and I had the opportunity to work at the Buren Powerhouse there. They were looking for people. There was quite a few guys that started on permits and stuff at that time. Matter of fact I initiated with five other guys when I got my book. After that, there was a lot of people took apprenticeships and there really wasn’t any apprenticeship program at that time anyhow. You worked on permit and went before the board. They okayed it and you got a book. That was it. There were quite a few guys at that time who got into the union the same time I did. [Where is the Buren Powerhouse?] Just this side of Wisconsin Rapids, in the little village of Buren, Consolidated Papermill there. It was a big powerhouse plant, a steam plant for paper-making machines. And at the same time, there was one paper machine was going in at the same time too, the same project. 5:40 [When you started out, what kind of work were you doing as an ironworker?] At the start, I was on the sheeting crew, siding up the powerhouse. Then from there on, I got into just about all of the phases then. [Was the sheeting crew like welding sheets?] No itt was aluminum sheeting, tiles. There were sandwich panels made up and then we bolted them to the girds. They’re still there today. LAUGHS [At that time, you say there wasn’t an apprenticeship program. So how did you learn to do all the things you needed how to do?] On the job training I guess. [Can you tell me, where there some old timers who gave you pointers or after screwing around, someone yelled at you...?] Well, worked under my Dad, he was a foreman. I worked under him for a few years. And then, I don’t know. I got to be a foreman at an early age, working for Consolidated and other local contractors. Wisconsin Bridge and Iron. I guess you just learn by being amongst people that knew. [Were there any people you particularly admired who were good at welding, connecting, tying re-bar, or...] Well, I knew a lot of guys through the years. I liked them all. They were all... Some of them were more structural men. Some were strictly rod men. They were all good people. I enjoyed working with everyone that I ever knew. 7:45 [So what was your favorite part of the trade?] Structural and heavy rigging. I just really enjoyed heavy rigging. I got into some pretty big projects and moved 300 ton transformers, pulling 200 ton debarking drum at Buren, that was at the Craft Mill. Done a lot of work at the  paper mills through the years. That was basically the bread and butter, the paper mill work. 8:24 [Can you tell me what’s involved in the heavy rigging?] Oh I guess knowing how to handle things, how to cope with everything. You’re talking about 200-300 ton of material. I mean, you gotta know what kind of rigging you’re going to put on and who is and what you got to do. Are you going to lift it. Are you going to roll it. Whatever the situation calls for. [Working with cranes then?] Yeah, most of your big stuff was always with cranes and power equipment. A lot of big stuff like when a big heavy chain falls. Consolidated Papermill had to set of 50 ton chain falls. [What did they call it?] Chain falls, chain hoists. They had sixteen parts of chain in them. You could pull all day on the thing and you’d hardly ever see the block move. They’d handle 50 ton apiece. [Were they set up inside the mill somewhere?] No you hung ‘em on a gantry or on a lifting beam or wherever you had to lift. There are a lot of places there. We moved the chipper out of the woodroom there We had to install mono-rail picking beam and pull the chipper out. It was down in under the first floor, kind of like the basement type of floor. Had to pick it up out of there and roll it out. Roll it on a truck. Took it in for re-building. It’s... There’s a lot of stuff involved in big equipment moving. I really enjoyed probably about the most. 10:20 [You mentioned working in paper mills. What kind of places have you worked in over the years? What kind of jobs?] Just about anything and everything. From the power houses, I worked at the Weston Plant, Powerhouses 2 and 3. Papermills...powerhouses and paper machines. Nekoosa, Rapids, Port Edwards, Stevens Point... Powerhouses down in Sheboygan... Two bridge jobs, I didn’t do too many bridge jobs. Mostly it was structure and machinery moving. And a lot of rod work with the college here in town. jobs. Tied a lot of rods...on the Sentry Building. Tied rods on that old building right from the start to finish. That was a big project. [Did you work mostly in Local 383 territory or did you boom out at all?] I didn’t boom out much at all. I was down in Milwaukee, working on a bridge, probably 2-3 weeks, month maybe. Work here, locally, was pretty slack in the mid-80s sometime. I was out in Sheboygan on the powerhouse for about three years. Other than that, I would say just my work was within driving distance. Green Bay and Rhinelander were the farthest and them places I drove. The powerhouse in Sheboygan, I stayed down there. I lived down there, got an apartment. One the good thing about that, down in that powerhouse in Sheboygan, every day after work, you could go out on the pier and go salmon fishing. LAUGHS That was lots of fun. I roomed with a guy from down around Iola. He was a millwright. He and I roomed together and he enjoyed fishing. Every day after work we’d go salmon fishing. Caught a lot of fish too. [An ironworker and a carpenter getting along?] Yup, yup. He was a helluva nice guy. I worked with him... And back at the Foundry, when I first ran into him, I was working for Hennes. He had worked for Hennes for quite some time. We roomed together down there in Sheboygan for about three years. [What was his name?] Roger... He’s been dead now quite a few years. It’ll come to me sooner or later... [How do you spell that...?] Hennes. They’re no longer in business. ASCO bought them out. They were pretty big in construction for years and years. I worked for Hennes for quite a few years. [Was he a Norwegian from over that way?] Yeah. The carpenter? Yeah. He was a Norwegian. [Polish and Norwegian? How did they get along...?] We got along fine. LAUGHS Yup. He was a millwright foreman and I was an ironworker foreman there. I had done all the rigging for him and the machine parts... He was putting in the turbine and generator. I was doing all the loading and rigging for them.  14:37 [So do the carpenters and ironworkers ever get into disputes at all?] Oh yeah, that was pretty common. [Could you tell me a little about that?] Well, no particular incidents but it was always...kind of bad blood between them, especially certain particular guys that were trouble makers more than anything. But they wound up getting settled. You won some, you lost some. That was... working with the paper mills, there was always conflicts with the mill rights. [What would some of the disputes be over?] Well, rigging. We never had any problems of unloading equipment and when stuff came in. But then when it came to setting machinery, basically they wanted to do all their own rigging when it comes to setting the machinery. According to our agreements, the rigging belongs to the ironworkers. It depends on who the job superintendent was, which way he leaned. The majority of job superintendents were carpenters, so you know which way they went. So they had to bring in the business agents and settle things. [Did you have to do any of that stuff yourself?] No. The majority of jobs, I was foreman on and I didn’t get involved in the steward... I don’t think I ever was a steward on the job. I was foreman on the job almost all my life. 16:25 [So what is involved with being a foreman?] Well, coordinating the work between the supervision and the men. Getting the job done. How many people you need to do the job. When you’re on a trip, all the stuff you need to plan things ahead. When there was a shut down, there was a spell there at Consolidated in Platteville. They had a two week shut down every year around the 4th of July. You could count on it. They had so many job scheduled that they had to get done. You had to know how many men you needed to do the job and get the jobs done and get them done on time. 17:20 Most of them was run overtime. That was the hottest part of the summer. It was pretty hot work a lot of the time. [I’ve talked to some fellows who said how a certain foreman was miserable to work with and some were great. Then I talked to people who had been foreman and how they managed the men. Do they yell at ‘em or do they work along side of them or how they...how they get things to happen.] Usually I got along pretty good with the guys. Once in awhile you get someone who wasn’t worth his salt. LAUGHS Most of the time you didn’t have much to say about running ‘em off the job. You just have to put up with it. I very seldom had any problems with as far as getting work done. Lot of times greenhorns, they didn’t know one end from another. You had to get them put in with someone who knew what was going on. Worked together. That was probably the toughest, pairing guys up on the job. Getting the right combination of workers together. 30 years, I guess, it all panned out. I’m sure I’ve made enough enemies over the years and I’m sure I probably made a few friends besides. Being a foreman isn’t a... It ain’t no glory behind it, I mean... A couple dollars an hour difference in pay sometimes it ain’t worth the grief you got to go through. Usually if there are problems, where does it go? It goes down to the foreman. 19:36 [You mentioned greenhorns. Did you ever run into...say, someone’s new and they get sent for a tool that doesn’t exist or...some prank played on them?] Cannon Report. LAUGHTER That was one in the service. The peons got sent for a cannon report. LAUGHTER Sky hooks a lot of times. Most of the time, there wasn’t much horseplay going on on the job site. Occasionally there would be something. A couple of guys working for Hennes at the Waupaca Foundry one time and they were really close buddies. Then they were pulling stuff on  each other just steady. It kept the rest of the crew in stitches most of the time. Everybody enjoyed them. They were both real swell guys and good workers. They just had something going every time you turned around. One of them, I know is dead, was Howie Reynolds and the other guy, Mel Ganthor. I haven’t seen him now for quite a few years. I think he’s still alive. I haven’t heard of him dying. 21:12 [What did they do?] Pull some crazy stuff on each other all the time. One time I think... Howie probably started it. Working in the Foundry, you had housing over the shaker conveyers and we were doing something inside of them, onthe conveyers or something. Mel was inside... I think Howie was inside. Anyway, one of them was inside and the other guy stuck his head in through the opening through the doorway there and everything was covered with dirt all over. He takes his arm and scrapes a pile of that black dirt right up and LAUGHS Mel was the one that scraped it...doing it to Howie. He didn’t forget that. Two days later, Mel was cutting a piece of manganese plate, the hardware plate and it’s hard to cut with a torch. You got to be real slow and steady in order to keep your metal flowing. He’s down on his hands and knees, cutting on that plate. Howie found a box of little box of...some old grease on it, laying around on the gird somewhere. Grease, black grease...and all full of foundry sand and everything else, dirt. Mel was bent over that plate cutting there, concentrating on that and Howie comes up to him and takes that box of grease and pushes it right on top of his head, screws it around. LAUGHS and he took off running. Stuff like that there...pulling on each other every once in a while. LAUGHTER [They both must have been good workers.] Oh yeah, they worked together for years. They got along fantastically with each other. They just had a little horseplay between them all the time. 23:30 [How about you – have you had any tricks played on you at all?] Well... not that I can recall as far as working on the job... I had a buddy of mine pull one on me one time. I’ll never forget it. I was probably in my early to mid twenties. We chased around a lot together quite a bit. One night about 3 o’clock in the morning he calls me up... “Gus, can you come and bail me out. I’m in jail. I need someone to bail me out.” So I get dressed and go down to the goddarn jail there. “Is Bert Ladeski here?” “No, there’s no Bert Ladeski here.” What the hell is going on. I found out later, he was sitting...got home late in the morning...or early in the morning, late at night. Was schnozzled up and called me about getting him out of jail. I called him up and I told him he better never end up in jail because you ain’t never going to get me to get you out! LAUGHS I’m sure he hasn’t forgotten that either. That was about the only thing that anyone ever pulled on me. 25:05 [Nicknames figured in much on the job?] Some guys all you ever knew them was by their nicknames. Cowboy Pearson was one of them. He was the guy that initiated the same day I did. I didn’t know that his first name was Howard for twenty years! I knew him by Cowboy all the time. I’m sure there were a few other guys with nicknames, nothing I can really recall. [Why did they call him Cowboy?] Well, he dressed and presented himself in cowboy boots and western type clothing, jeans and western type shirts and everything. [Pearson sounds like a Swede or some kind of...] All I know was that his correct name was Howard Ward 26:18 [Years ago, I got to know a couple of Ho-Chunk guys who were ironworkers. One was  Ken Funmaker.] I knew him. [Did you ever work with Kenny?] Yup. He was a good worker when he was on the job. That was the biggest problem. When he had a paycheck...I don’t know if that’s a typical Indian or what but it would always be a few days before he got back to the job. CHUCKLES He was a good worker when he was on the job. He’d get drunk and take a few days to sober up. [I stayed up all night drinking with him one time.] LAUGHTER [I guess he got hurt on the Portage power plant.] There’s another. My son was a pretty good friend with him. I can’t think of what his name is. It wasn’t Kenny. [Elliot? Robert?] I don’t know, all I know he was a Funmaker. Might have been one of those. [Also worked with a Potawatomi, Ned Daniels. He was a welder and worked mostly out of the local in Green Bay. He died awhile ago.] Y eah. 28:00 [Any characters you encountered on the job? Some who were colorful or memorable?] Mel and Howie were two of the most comical characters you ever run into. Swell of guys that they were, either one, they’d give anybody the shirt off their back. But they were just lots of fun to be around all the time, no matter what the job was. There was never a dull moment when them guys were around. They were always lot of fun. And then there were our after hour sessions, stop over at the bars after work. We had some pretty good times then. [So things changed over time as far as guys getting together and go to the tavern?] Well, no, I don’t think so. They probably did with me. As I got older, I kind of gave up going to taverns. I have been retired for over 12 years and right before I retired, I’d stop in pretty regular. Sit with the guys and stuff. Got home late for supper more than once I guess. LAUGHS 29:32 [When you finish a job or top out or something, is that cause for some kind of ceremony?] Well, a lot of time, there would be a pretty good party at the topping out. There was one party down at the Weston plant there... It was towards the end of the job and I was working for Hennes at that time too. They had a bunch of scrap iron they sold off the job. He threw a big party, all the boilermakers and ironworkers, and... We had a good feed, a big party, all night. Something like that. The guys would sell scrap iron at the end of the job or something and throw a beer party. Occasionally it would be a retirement party, someone was retiring. We had our share of parties. [Do you think more so than other trades...or similar...or...] Oh I would almost venture to say ironworkers are probably a little heavier drinkers than most. I don’t know too many ironworkers that didn’t drink much. I know a lot of them that quit drinking. And some of them quit at a pretty young age. They had reasons for quitting. Their wives told them you quit or get out. 31:24 [When I was interviewing some of these fellows around Madison, “Oh, you’re going up to Stevens Point – or farther north. That’s where the Jack Pine Savages are...” I grew up in Rice Lake so I always thought of myself as a Jack Pine Savage. So can you talk about that...?] I don’t know how that ever come to be. Nekoosa and Rapids area, there’s a lot of Jack Pine in that country. Paper mills, everything. They used a lot of Jack Pine. How that ever came about to be... We were always referred to as Jack Pine Savages quite a ways back already. I don’t know, other than that there was a lot of Jack Pine up here, like Adams County and surrounding counties, southern Wood county... That’s all there is is Jack Pine that country. There wasn’t a helluva lot of ironworkers that come out of that part of the country. [So what did you think about it if someone called you a Jack Pine Savage?] Didn’t bother me in the least. LAUGHS What the  heck... [In the 60s, when all these Polish jokes came out, did that figure out at all in the trade? Did people call you Polack or anything...?] Never bothered me anyway. I told just as many Norwegian jokes or Polish jokes. Listened to just as many, as far as racist or bothering a nationality, that never bothered me in the least. How many Norwegian or Swede jokes do you hear and pass them on... Polish jokes. That doesn’t bother me any. 33:30 [Do jokes get told much on the job site, people on break or at the tavern afterwards?] Yeah, well some guys could tell a joke and every joke they told would remind them of another one. They could go all night and keep telling jokes. I can’t remember one joke five minutes after I hear it. [Some guys are like that. Max and Pete Trzebiatowski, those guys were good. Do you ever hear of any ironworker jokes? Ironworker and carpenter...or something like that.] No, none that I really recall. Probably has been. You can take just about any kind of joke and even change the names and make it ironworker and a carpenter, or a priest and a rabbi. So I’m sure there were jokes that way. But I don’t recall any particular ones. 34:40 [How have things changed over the years, starting with your Dad and you being in the trade... Gear or safety things...?] The biggest thing that bothered me the worst was that safety crap. I’ve done my share of connecting and stuff and I never tied off, I never wanted to be tied off. You make a connection. You get up and go to the next one, not come to the end of the rope and so you have to unhook. That safety crap, that really... I’m glad I retired when I did. There’s nothing wrong with it. I’m sure it has saved quite a few lives. Everyone has a different outlook about things. Management and your company and everything else. They treated it a lot different than they did at the start. It’s a pretty big thing today, the safety part of it. I enjoyed riding the headache ball, going from point-to-point on the rig. Later years, then we used the basket which wasn’t much different than riding the headache ball. But after a while, you couldn’t even use the basket any more. You had to use man lifts and tie off every place you moved to. ‘Course my Dad worked with a guy, working on a dam. Paul Lang. I think they were at Petenwell. INAUDIBLE. He fell off of a scaffold 8 feet and got killed. [8 feet...] Yup. Two rings of scaffolds, fell off of there and broke his neck. 36:47 [Have you had any accidents?] No, nothing... Oh a few cuts and smashed fingers, a few crippled up fingers. That one won’t straighten out. That happened at Sentry. LAUGHTER Never had any serious mishaps. Not really any close calls. One probably could have been down at the powerhouse in Sheboygan...no, that was at Green Bay. I was riding the headache ball, working for Hennes there, working on the precipitator. I got on the headache ball and the operator was going to swing me back down to the ground, probably for lunch or whatever it was. He was working a little bit in the blind, not totally in the blind. He didn’t raise the hook up high enough and swing it out. And he caught the beam with that hook on the headache ball. Well the line was laid out at probably a 45 degree angle and I’m hanging on to it. He didn’t have a non-spin cable on the rig. He had enough strain on there, it kinda opened up the twist in the cable, the lay of the cable. And then when he swung back, I couldn’t even let go of the cable. The lay opened up and it pinched my gloves right in the lay of the cable. So he had a little strain on it. That was probably the closest I ever come to having anything happen. [How did you get out of that?] Well, he realized that he hooked the hook on the iron. Then he swung back and picked the load up and then went down to the ground. I wound up, I just had to pull my gloves  off. LAUGHS They were wrapped in a cable. The twists on the cable opened up and there was enough to pinch some of the fabric in the... [But not your fingers. Your fingers were... Oh man...] 39:00 [When you started out, what kind of gear did you have and how has the gear changed over time, what you wear...] I don’t think nothing ever really changed much as far as clothing or tools. Clothes, you just dressed accordingly. In the winter, you put on what you had to stay warm, and in the summer you stripped down to stay cool. The tools and equipment pretty much stayed the same all along. Well, to start with, on rods, you used a neck roll for tying rods, a big roll of wire you hung it around your neck and under your arm. That was a pain in the ass. It didn’t take too long and every shirt you owned, the shoulder on your shirt was wore out—just rolling that big roll of wire around, tying rods. Well then they come out the wire wheels, those little spools. That really made things a lot better. As far as structural, things didn’t change much. I think I was on one job where they still done a little bit of riveting. They riveted one little--it was a fly ash tower was what it was. That was at the Buren Power House. Then everything pretty much went to high tensile bolts after that. There was one little spell they used what they called darlettes. They were a high tensile bolt. They had a head like a rivet, then they had splangs right behind the head. We had to use a riveting gun to drive it in the hole. And the impact on the nut on the backside. We had to drive ‘em with a #90 riveting hammer to drive them into the holes. They didn’t last very long. I don’t think I used them more than a couple of years, couple jobs. I don’t know if they figured... They figured I think it acted more like a rivet. Fill the hole full. And then they found out, in time, with the tension on high tensile bolts, it wasn’t necessary to fill in the hole. The strength came in the sheer itself. The tension between the two pieces of metal done more than filling the hole up. With your high tensile bolts now and torque wrenches and everything, impacted it. Them darlettes didn’t ask very long at all. 41:54 [You mentioned when you had that wire...] Neck roll. [Yeah...tearing up your shirt. I ran into some guys whose wives made really good wool socks for the winter or maybe did some re-enforcing on some of their clothing. Do you ever have any custom made stuff...] Sew a leather patch on your shoulder that would take the wear of that roll. That helps. And then it got warmer too. That patch of leather in the summer time. I think the problem was that... Its new wire, just like you use today, you could let go of the end of that wire and it could spring up and pop you one in the face. It wasn’t too nice. [Did that ever happen to you?] Yeah, well... [There’s a little song that I’ve heard called “Ironworkers Blues.” It was made up by a guy named Duane Olby and he recorded in the Twin Cities. I used to know who he was but I never met him. He was still living when I was living in Washburn, Wisconsin. I’ve been in touch with his son. His son sent me a copy of the recording. But it has something about the wire comes loose and it hits your lip...or something like that.] 43:36 [What about the hard hats. Was there anything distinctive about the ironworkers’ hard hat?] No, there’s really nothing special about them. I mean everybody wore the hard hat. If you were on some job, some companies had different colored hats for different trades. But other than that, there wasn’t anything special about them. [Was there a certain color for ironworkers?] No, not nothing specific. I guess that was just up to the company’s discretion. They just see somebody goofing out there. Well, that was a carpenter, he’s got a red hard hat. That was an  ironworker, he’s got had a green hard hat. So he knew...just by looking at the hat what trade he belonged to. [Some guys decorate their hard hats.] Well, legally, the only thing you can do is put like stickers or decals on. As far as any other kind of decoration--actually, it’s foolish, it weakens the hat. You start drilling holes in it and mount stuff that shouldn’t be. Technically, you ain’t supposed to put anything but a decal on it. [Like paint or something...] Well, paint was never a problem. One guy, George Bienfang Jr (I THINK), he painted his hard hat titty pink. LAUGHTER I guess that was his trademark. LAUGHTER 45:25 [Your tools, how did you go about acquiring your tools when you started out?] Bought ‘em as you needed them, I guess. Some of them were handed down and some other guys...if...they had more tools than what they needed. They could have 2-3 wrenches and some didn’t need one of them. I think I’m sure all the tools that I have, all but the bull pin, I guess I got from my Dad. All the wrenches and everything he bought. [What did you call it, that you got from your Dad?] A bull pin. [What’s a bull pin?] It’s a tapered pin that you drive in holes to line up the iron. [It’s different from a spud wrench?] Yeah, that’s all it was used for, just for lining up a hole. It was a tapered pin. [So did you ever put your name on your tools or mark them somehow?] Well if you just marked ‘em, you’d stamp your initials on them or something. Very seldom did you lost any tools. 46:35 [How about...you were growing up. Did you ever slice wire or tie knots for the trade?] Oh yeah, I tied a lot of knots and sliced rope. Sliced long, short splice. I don’t know--hundreds of knots. LAUGHS [Can you talk about how you learned how to do that and just some instance...what...] Tying knots for an ironworker is quite important. You use it...well, you don’t call it a rope, you call it a line. You use it in a lot of applications, for tag-lining a load or pulling a bucket of bolts up to yourself. Many things. You oughta know how to tie a knot that’s going to hold, then its something that you can untie when you want to take it off. Over the years, I always considered myself pretty good as far as tying knots. I knew a lot of knots. [Is that still part of the trade?] Oh yeah. Yup. [Now a days, what would you use the knots for...? Say, working on a job... nowadays?] Same thing as always I guess. If you want to send up a bundle of something in a secure, so that half of it didn’t fall off on the way up. 48:28 There was an old story about this guy—I don’t remember how it even all went. This guy was going to hoist up a keg of bolts up to the top of a roof of a building or some darn thing. He got all banged up and smashed and the guy asked what happened? It all started out that... He started pulling up this keg of bolts and it got too heavy for him. He let it back down and he come back up to the rope. He had a hold of the line and jumped off the roof. Let his body weight pulled the keg of bolts. On the way up, the keg banged into him and it screwed up his arm, hurt his arm. Then when they got all the way to the top, what the hell was it? It hit a beam or something and the bottom of the keg fell out and all the bolts fell out. No that was probably the second trip around or some damn thing. Well, anyway he got hit back and forth three different times. Once he run his fingers up through the shiv when a keg of bolts overhauled him and it just went on and on and on. That’s how he got banged up. Every time he met the keg of bolts on the way up, that keg would hit him when he was on the way down. And when he was on the way up, the bolts were coming down to hit him. It was just a series of getting banged up. [I heard a song about that, Why Clancy Wasn’t At Work Today] That same story has been switched around in a  hundred different ways. Once, a bricklayer with a pile of bricks or a bucket of bricks. And I think that bolts, I think that was in an ironworkers magazine one time years ago. I heard that same story often. Different versions of it but basically it’s the same ending all the time. LAUGHTER 50:35 [Did you splice cable too?] No. That was...a rather complicated technique, to splice cable. The only thing that anybody ever did splice cable was making chokers, making eyes on that cable. As far as splicing cable together for linking out a piece of cable, it wasn’t practical. Making chokers was quite an art. [Did you make them or know guys who make them?] I knew a guy that did make them. [Could you talk about someone who was a choker maker?] That don’t... I never really know him personally. I knew the guy that made it. Companies would submit an order and they’d make different sizes, 3/8ths inches, different lengths. They would make whatever they wanted. [Were they ironworkers?] Yeah, most of them were ironworkers who did it. Some of them are retired ironworkers or whatever. [They do it by hand obviously?] Yeah. There’s a little hand work. I have pictures of the equipment... It’s like a thimble you wrap the cable around and then you’ve got a dip that you stick between the lay and then you thread the different strands in between the lays. [Yeah, I’ve seen those tools at Local 383.] That’s quite an act. I could splice rope, long splice, short splice. Splice eye in a rope. But I never got into cable splicing. 52:26 [What about... Ironworkers got to work in all kinds of weather. Can you talk about any strange or difficult weather you worked in over the years?] Oh, plenty of it. Some awful hot days and some awful cold days. One of the college jobs there [UW Stevens Point], that was early in the spring. Working on rods. Down from the footings up, putting basement walls in. Facing to the west in the morning time, the sun beating against the wall--it was hot. Hung a thermometer on the wall ties on there that wall--the panels are all oiled to release concrete and stuff. That thermometer went up to about 125 degrees. You sit there and sweat it out, and hope to get some breeze. Get done and get out of there. [Does it affect the iron or steel at all?] Oh, it’s hot. I tell ya. Working connecting the iron. The thing is, painted iron wasn’t that bad. There are a lot of jobs with raw iron, unpainted. That black iron is pretty damn hot to sit on. You can’t even grab a hold of it, it was so hot. You could fry an egg on that iron a lot of time. Cold got just as bad. Doing one of the dormitory jobs, working for Utter [?] in Point. You come in from break, I was wearing Sorel boots. Stopped in for a lunch break and my feet were cold. Took my boots off and warmed my feet up, pulled the liners off the soles and I couldn’t pull them off. They were frozen to the bottom of the boot. So now you know how your feet got cold. [It’s like those stories you hear about guys in the log drives. When they take their boots off, their boots were frozen on. So the iron would get slippery and dangerous in the winter?] Oh yeah. It can get pretty damn slick sometimes. Sometimes you had to go up there to clean it off. It took days. It wouldn’t melt off if you didn’t clean it off. [How would you clean it off then?] With a scraper and broom and shovels. You had a snow storm, snow built up on the iron. Well then you get some warmer weather, it starts thawing. Then it freezes back again at night. If you didn’t clean it off, it would take a week before it melted off unless you had really good weather. [Did you ever use torches or anything like that?] It wasn’t practical to try and drag it... The only way you could do anything would be with a brush burner and a bottle gas tank. A brush burner... You ain’t going to drag an LP tank up on the ice to try to melt the ice off. You done the best to scrape it off, get as much off as you could and then a little bit of sunshine would melt it off.  55:52 [Some of the ironworkers I’ve met and they’ve done some metal work or tables out of rebar or making sculptures out of tie wire. Have you ever run into that or do anything like that yourself?] I haven’t done none of it. No. After retirement, I went a little bit into some wood working projects. I never done anything in iron work as far as all that ornamental stuff goes. I would enjoy getting one of those plasma cutters. You must have seen some of the work that they’ve cut out with plasma cutters. It’s computerized... [Oh I haven’t.] They cut out pictures and stuff. It gets pretty darn expensive. [Yeah. Ed Smith has made a couple of miniatures of lattice cranes. I was at his place last week. It made me wonder if anybody ever made miniatures of any girders, or structures for building... Sometimes trades people made them.] Well, I’ve seen a lot of stuff made with match sticks or balsam wood or something. Build bridges with them. As far as metal works or something, I never got involved in any of it. 57:38 [Can you tell me a little bit about the folks who are in this picture then... You talked a little bit about your Dad but how about the other folks.] My Dad is in the middle here. It was when he got his 50 year pin. That’s me on the side and that’s my oldest son, Dennis. He’s an ironworker now. He’s down working on windmills down working by Portage. That’s my next younger brother. He’s retired now. He’s 69 or 70. And that’s his son, Wayne, who lives next door. I sold my old place to him. He’s living in my... I own a 40 and that old farm building and we put this house up in 2005. Sold the house over there. [What’s your brother’s name?] Jim. He’s got a book in the... Jim got his book in 1965. As far as I can figure out on the date on this thing, Dad got his book in 1941. I got mine in 1957. Jim got his in 1965 and my son Dennis got his in 1980. And Wayne, Jim’s son, is 1990. 59:13 [Some folks have told me that in a lot of the trades, but especially in the ironworkers, in the early days there were a lot of farm kids that got into the trade. Did you run into that? People who grew up on the farms became ironworkers?] Not especially. I probably knew just as many that came from the cities than came off the farm. I wouldn’t say one way or the other...more than the other. [Some people refer Local 383 as a farmers’ local sometimes. I don’t know where that came from.] I don’t either. LAUGHS [You hadn’t heard that.] No. 01:00:09 [I’m about out of questions but do you want to say something overall about your experience with the trade, what you think of about ironworkers.] Well, I enjoyed the whole...my whole lifetime as an ironworker. Here are some of my pictures from earlier. These are from the Learning Resource Center in Stevens Point and the addition they put on and what year that was. These pictures are INAUDIBLE. [So is that you on the beam?] That’s me. That’s me there. And that’s the same picture. [So this is from the Stevens Point Journal...?] South Center at the college there. [Yeah, but the paper is the Stevens Point...?] It’s the Stevens Point Journal now. These pictures were taken by the Point photographer, Doug Wojcik.. After these were published in the paper, he came and gave me these pictures that he took, connecting the trusses, trusses on that building. [That’s cool. I’ll make some copies of those.] This is at Nekoosa. This goes back quite a few years ago. Got a stiff leg putting on an addition on top of the paper machine. 01:02:03 [These are pictures of ironworkers up on top of the...like the lone ironworkers on top of the beam. I’ve seen a couple like that and they kind of remind me of some of those pictures  you see in the lumber camps with the big load of logs and someone on top of them.] This job was way back in the building. We had a little narrow gauge railroad track built on the roof and they had a crane down below to hoist iron up. Put it on a little cart and they’d roll it down to where we could get a hold of it with the stiff leg, to set the iron there. There’s one of the trusses going up. We had that stiff leg there, the beams mounted on the top of the roof there. The stiff leg was lashed down too. You’d put the iron in ahead of yourself as far as you could go, and then we ducked the boom back. Here we’re ducking the boom back behind to pick up our skid beams and cast ‘em ahead of you so you can move the stiff leg farther ahead. You had to unhook one leg of the brace legs, duck the boom around, the leg around the boom and then swing your the skids back around. [The stiff leg is like a stable part of the... Could you describe it?] This is probably about as good a picture as you’re going to see of it. This is a mast. It goes straight up and you got a bull wheel on the bottom that you can turn. You turn your boom around. These legs are triangular, off each way on the backside. That supports the boom. You could swing like from that corner around to this corner. You couldn’t reach back here without hitting those legs. So in order to move these beams behind you, you had to disconnect this one leg. You held the mast with a come-along and cable. Duck the boom around behind you and reconnect it, grab your skid beams and throw ‘em over where you could reach and then place them farther ahead so you can move on down the building. [Wow. This would be the part of the trade that would be called rigging. Is that right?] No, that’s stiff leg work. [Stiff leg.] Stiff leg derrick. [Makes me think of sailing ships.] Between a stiff leg and a gin pole, this is a stiff leg. You had stiff braces behind it. And a gin pole, you just had rope falls behind it. You used like an electric pole, telephone pole, something in the front with guidelines in back with an air tug or something that would fastened to the pole. It’s used for setting iron you couldn’t reach with a crane. [There’s a lot to the trade.] 01:05:33 [What did you think of it, as a trade?] I enjoyed every bit it. I wouldn’t want to do anything else. [What did you like the most or why do you think you enjoyed it so much?] Well one thing is being outdoors most of the time. This was one of my last jobs in Buren, we put up a big stack. This is the crew, on top of that 300 foot stack. That’s my nephew, he’s welding. That’s my son. And that’s a shot of the stack just going up with the rig. Just setting that top piece. This is at the Kraft mill. There’s the engineer on the job, one of the Consolidated’s engineers. That’s the basket that you had to ride up on. [Is that you in there?] That’s me. I don’t even know who that was. [I THINK I’LL TURN THE RECORDER OFF.]
Ironworkers;William W. (Bill) Kerwin;0:02 trade? 0:31 Graduated from there. I went to West High School. After West High School I worked for the city a little bit. And then I got drafted by the army. Went in and served my two years there, and then two years in the reserves. I was working for the city. There was three, four friends of mine that were ironworkers. So they told me to go down to the hall and apply. And I did. It wasn’t long I got hired. [Who were your buddies?] Charles Gorey and Jim Sielehr. They were ahead of me, but they were apprentices at the time. We were all the same age. [High school together?] No, they were from the old neighborhood. I hung around the The Bush a lot. Lot of people’d say, “The Bush!” y’know. But I could go in the Bush because of my friends. Lot of people wouldn’t Topic Announcement, initial question–when and where born, how you got into ironworkers I was born and raised on Charter Street in Madison. I went to St. James Grade School. go there at night . You’ve heard about the Bush? [Yeah, it seemed like a great place.] It was! Back in them days nobody locked their doors. We’d just go knock on the doors. “C’mon in! How are ya?” And “Is so and so home?” And that’s the way it was in the old days. Then I became an ironworker in March of “66, served my apprenticeship, did my years, my hours and stuff. Then I was hired by Theodore Kupfer’s. I worked there for 28 years. 2:04 [Any in your family in the building trades?] No. My father was the lieutenant on the fire department and my brother went to college. My other ones worked at Oscar Mayer’s and that was it. [What attracted you to the trade?] When I worked for the city, a friend of mine, Smiley Weiner, was my foreman and he said, “You know, you don’t want to work for the city. Got to get out of here. Get in the trades. Get out. You’re not going to make a decent living working for the city.” This was 1965. I went down to the Labor Temple, signed up for the plumbers and I signed up for the ironworkers. The ironworkers called me. That’s how I got in. 2:54 [Tell me about Kupfer Ironworks. What kind of a place...] Kupfer’s was a great place. There were a lot of great friends that worked there. We were all apprentices. I could name you a dozen guys who were all there. We all got along good and it was a great place to work and they kept you busy. You didn’t get laid off much. It was fine. Everyone was friends there. You had great Christmas parties. A lot of nice times, a lot of parties. But it’s too bad. Most of them are dead now. I miss... I happened to see my old superintendent, Bob Benton, three days before he died. He was kind of one of the ones that took me under his wings at Kupfer’s and made me a good ironworker. I became foreman and worked here and worked at... My favorite place was at the Kohl Center. I worked at the Kohl Center for 16 months and got out of there and went to Badgerland. I finished up my career with Badgerland. I was 63 years old and I said it was time to quit. That was it. 4:06 [Tell me a little bit about the old timers with whom you were in the trenches...] You couldn’t believe those old timers. They knew everything. I mean, there was Syd Erstad. Dick Higby was my really...like my hero. Dick took me under his wing and taught me very well how to be an ironworker and how to be safe, how to figure out the blueprint--and George Bunders and George’s Dad, Bob Benton, Jim Hein and Stub-all these great guys who worked for Kupfer’s back then. You just can’t remember them all – they were all so good. It was fun. I enjoyed that, all those years... [When you first started out, what kind of work were you doing and how did you...] The first day I went on the job I started my career at James Madison Memorial. I went to work. Syd Erstad was the foreman and Norm Lenzer was there and Everett Erstad and Norm Brown and a couple other guys that I don’t quite remember. But here I come on the job, a green horn, right out of the hall. First day on the job, some guy says, “Put a choker on that beam.” I looked at him like, “What??? Put a choker? What a minute! This is my first day!” LAUGHS Those old time ironworkers, they didn’t have patience. “What do you mean you don’t know. Get over here now and I’ll show you.” You had to make sure it was completely centered so it would go up right for the connectors and stuff. I learned a lot in the first week. [So a lot of language, a lot of terms there?] Well, you know, construction workers had their own way of saying things. Language wasn’t really clean language. They weren’t afraid of speak their word, them old timers. Them old timers made the union what it was. You did your best. I mean, like, “Get up and crawl on that iron!” That was on my third day. I mean, I didn’t want to get up there  and start walking around. I was kind of green but I learned. I got along good. So then I stayed with Syd for about a year. He was the foreman that I stayed with, going to different schools and stuff. Then when you work for Kupfer’s, they had maybe 6-7 foremen who all had trucks. You get farmed out with what they say. You go work for this guy a day and you work for that guy a day. That’s what I did and I enjoyed it – it was fun! 7:00 [Can you tell me about some of the different parts of the trade, like welding or rod busting or connecting... Your early experiences with some of those.] My early experiences...I was kind of a layout man for bar joist. You measure them out, lay them out and you didn’t do much welding until you went to school and got to be a pretty good welder. I was a certified welder once and then I never went back and re-did it. But I could weld. Then you get up there and all of a sudden I became a connector, which I really loved. Sit up there and grab the iron and cut loose. Move on to the next piece and that was fun. Never did much rod busting. Never did. I did a little bit at the Kohl Center and a few bridge decks, but most of Kupfer’s was all structural work. We were always doing this and doing that. One time I worked on a TV tower, WISC-TV tower. I changed some light bulbs and some welding, tack a piece on there. It was like a four day job. It didn’t last long but it was exciting to climb way up there. I could almost see Mount Horeb from up there – it was really great to see. I should have had binoculars but I never did. 8:27 [Tell me about being a connector. What did you wear, what kind of gear did you have?] Well, you wear your structural belt, had a bag full of bolts. You sit up there on the iron and they’d swing a piece up and you’d grab it. You got to make sure that you got it, end to end, because most iron was numbered and the numbers went a certain way according to the blueprint. A piece swung over and you grabbed and stuck the spud wrench on it. Try to hold it. Stick one bolt in and snug it up. The other guy gets his...crawl out, unhook it and wait for the next piece. [How important is it...because you work as a team...] Right, you had a partner. [Can you tell me about a favorite partner and some of the teamwork that’s involved?] Well, you know, Norm Brown and I got along good. We were kind of both young apprentices. I liked connecting with Norm. He was a good guy. There were so many different guys you worked with. Every day you’re on a different job and someone needs help, this and that. According to the union rules, there are five guys to a crew and so you just switched around jobs and connected iron with guys. Doing gymnasiums was probably the most fun. Great big long high trusses and put in the big bar joists. You got to set them in time to make sure they didn’t tip over. That was kind of exciting, putting them out there. [Did the connectors have a certain sense of identity, a high status thing?] Yeah, you know, guys used to say, “I’m a connector, that’s all I do.” I became a foreman for Kupfer’s for awhile, traveling out of town to do work. You hire men out of their local. Down in Illinois with Ed Smith, we had some crews down there. We did some connecting and stuff. Ed was my ground man and I was the foreman. The guys we had out of Chicago were connectors. Well, we got the iron all connected and everything and they said, “Well, we would like our paycheck.” And I told them we had a lot of work to do. “No, no, we’re connectors. That’s it. We don’t do detail work. We don’t. We’re high flyers.” Okay. That’s the way it was. You paid them off and they left. But ironworkers were pretty set in their ways. They’re pretty hard headed guys. There were guys that wouldn’t tie a box and there were guys who wouldn’t connect or do structural because they didn’t like height. That’s the way it was.  11:20 [Can you talk about going up...] As you go up, build floor after floor... [I mean your own experiences because... The challenge to get up high at first. Did you have to overcome anything in terms of balance or...] I was never scared of heights and stuff. A lot of times I thought, “Gee, I have to be careful. I don’t want to fall.” You always had that in your mind. You sit back there and took your time and didn’t hurry. I was very lucky and never fell, never really got seriously hurt or anything. But...yeah... I worked on buildings where you work your way up. You start on the ground floor and go up and up and up. You get up there and the higher you get, I think the safer you get. Basically, some guys would say, “Well, I was...” I know. I was an ironworker. You use a little more caution, you’re a little more safer. The higher you get, the more safety conscious you get. 12:40 [In the older days, did guys used to have a drink to steady their nerves or anything like that?] Well, I hate to bring that up but you know... I remember when there was a bottle stashed around on the job. They were old time ironworkers, you know? They were set in their ways. Back in the winter time, go have a coffee break, right? Give me B&B. You’d look, and I was just a young kid. I didn’t know what the hell B&B was. Because black and brandy coffee break. That’s the way it was when it was cold and stuff. Things have changed today with the new rules and regulations. All the drug testing that goes on now and stuff. Basically, them old guys knew what they were doing. They were great guys. You can not just... anyone ever tell you that the old time ironworkers, them hard headed so and sos, they would teach you if they asked. They were really good guys, deep down. 13:57 [Can you tell me about any who were particular characters that there might be a story or two about?] Well, my favorite guy I used to work with was Norm Lenzer. This guy was a great ironworkers. Probably other ironworkers told you about Norm. This guy would do a handstand on the beam just to show you he could do it. And this man was probably one of the smarter guys I worked with who could really teach you something if you wanted to pay attention and learn. I mean Norm was from the old school, an old time ironworker. He would bark at you, you know, and call you names but deep down inside, he was a good guy. He wouldn’t be afraid to teach you like tying knots or doing this or how to connect iron. You do it this way and you do it that way. Norm, he was a great guy. A lot of guys didn’t like Norm but I always thought Norm was a good guy when I worked with him. [What did you call people?] “You dumb punk.” Everyone was a punk. When you were an apprentice, you were a punk. You didn’t know nothing. “When are you going to wake up and learn something,” ya know? You know the cuss words, you’d use them too but... They didn’t mean much by it. The old timers called everyone a punk. It was a good learning experience. I enjoyed it. I worked 40 some years. [Any other characters that you can think of?] Syd was a good foreman who told you what needed to be done. He didn’t bother you. Some foremen would stand over your shoulder and watch. Most of the guys at Kupfer’s were really good foremen. Taught very well. Like Dick Higby and young George Bunders...of course we called him young George. They were good guys. I worked with them a lot. Higby was a good ironworker. He was one of those guys who never got excited or anything but he was a good teacher. That’s most of it. The guys I worked with...you know... And then I became a foreman and then it was my turn to work on those apprentices. “God damn it – pay attention!” LAUGHS “How many times do I have to tell you this!” But when you’re a foreman, you have the young men...like when I went to work with Badgerland. We had a lot of young kids right out  of school and stuff. They want to get right up there and be the... “I’m going to be the connector. I’m going to be...” “Well, you have to be careful now. Take your time. Don’t be doing this now. I don’t want anyone getting hurt.” I didn’t want someone to get hurt on my job and I was very lucky. And that’s as far as I can... Great ironworkers, great days. Badgerland was the last company I worked for. That was interesting when all those young kids and stuff, right here in Waunakee. 17:30 [What kind of work was being done in Badgerland?] Badgerland was Badgerland Metal Building. They did a lot of metal buildings. I never did much welding... Well, going back a few years, I worked for Sullivan. Ken F. Sullivan did nothing but metal buildings. Put up the structural and then you sheet it. You did it all. So you learned quite a bit doing a metal building. You were a real tradesman. You started from scratch. Then when you got done, the building looked nice. With Badger Building, sheet metal workers were...ironworkers... I did mostly structural for Badgerland. They did a few metal buildings, but I didn’t get involved with that very much. Other than that, you know, like I said. The best job I had was the Kohl Center. Worked for Oscar J. Boldt and got to do the Kohl Center for 15 months. That was interesting. [What kind of work did you do at the Kohl Center?] I did some structural and was in charge of all of the bolts, to make sure the right bolts went into the right holes. Did a little of rod tying when I first started. Then we went into structural. Did the roof and worked on the scoreboard and stuff above. Jack of all trades. 18:52 [Cool. When you started out, what was the gear like and where did you get your gear and so forth.] You mean all the tools and stuff? [Yeah, and the stuff you wore.] You could go down to the hall. As guys retired, they’d bring their equipment to the hall and you could buy it as used. Or you could buy new. Buy your structural belt and your bolt bag and all that. You get your hard hat. Things have changed in 40 years when you have all that safety equipment now that we never had back then. [Did you ever have anything homemade or modified or anything like that?] No, no... You had a hammer but of course it was called a beater. And your pin and your spud wrenches and your crescent wrench and that’s what you used for connecting. [What about the hard hats?] Yeah, you had to have a hard hat at all times. They changed. I always wore one with a big wide brim because being a red head, I didn’t want to get sunburned and stuff. But hard hats was something that they nagged at you all the time. [Was there anything distinct about the ironworkers hard hats?] No, nothing. A hard hat was a hard hat. A regular old...put it on. [What about the color...or...] No, I don’t think the color... I think most ironworkers wore their hard hats backwards. The reason was your welding hood. If you had the bill on it and your welding hood come down, it would hit. You see ironworkers today in most pictures and they have their hard hat backwards. “I’m an ironworker. I have my hard hat on.” [Did people ever decorate...? Now you see stickers all over it. In the old days, would people ever do anything with their hard hats?] Oh yeah, you’d always put your union sticker on your hard hat or if you donated something. A lot of people had different colored stickers on their hat. I was never into that. I used to have one for a local #383 because when you went out of the local, you know, and worked for different locals where you have to check in, they wanted to know where you were from. 21:11 [So did you boom out very much?] No, when I worked for Kupfer’s, there was some  work out of town, so you had to go. I think I was in Illinois twice so I had to check in twice there. Then out in Milwaukee. Of course, when you’re in Milwaukee, that’s a different local. That’s local #8 and you had to check in. I worked in Milwaukee 2-3 years with Dick Higby and those guys from Kupfer’s. I think we worked Northridge and Southridge when I worked for Kupfer’s. [Would you stay there for a week or...?] No, we drove back and forth, Dick and I. I think there was four of us and we’d all take turns. Drive back and forth, so it wasn’t bad. 21:50 [What about break time and lunches? How did that go over the years when you were working?] Well, you always took your coffee break at 9:30. Went in and had a little sandwich and a cup of coffee. Fifteen minutes time limit and then you went back to work. And then at noon... In the old days they’d go out for lunch. A lot of guys would go out for lunch. A lot of guys would bring their lunch bucket. You sit around and tell stories. They always had pictures on the wall, Playboy pictures on the wall in your job trailers. Now today with the girls on the job, things have changed. I noticed that when I was getting ready to retire. [Was that a good thing?] Well, you know... Eh... If she can do the job, why complain? I worked on a couple of jobs with a couple of young ladies. They could tie rods and kept up with the rest of them. They weren’t as strong... They couldn’t pick up... The rods come in 8th inch. A #8 rod is an inch. It’s 44 foot long. What are you going to expect a woman to pick up? Some of those hard head guys would go, “Hey, do it or get off the job.” No, no, no. Use common sense. Like anything else, it was pretty hard to get the women in. I could probably say about my father--he was a lieutenant on the fire department--he’d go nuts if he knew women were in the fire department. My father died...I think he retired in 1962 or 63 from the fire department. He was an old timer. But you know, it’s like any business. Women, right away they get excited. 24:00 [Did the tavern play much of a part in the life of an ironworker years ago?] Well, you know... A lot of guys after work had to stop. That’s construction. I never did. My wife told me, “If you’ve got to get drunk to face me, don’t come home.” I learned that lesson in a hurry. But there were a few guys that had to stop every night and have their beer. Not me. I kind of got educated at a young age. [Some of the young guys kind of piss it away.] Yeah, yeah. There’s a lot of guys I know that worked and spent more in the tavern than they should have but that’s the way the old timers were. It’s like anybody. I bet if you interview people from Gisholt or Oscar Mayer’s or any of the old businesses around Madison. It would be the same thing. I know when I was a kid growing up, I used to love to go down to the rail road yard down on West Washington Avenue. Of course it was Tremry’s [sp?] and a few other bars down there, that’s where the railroad guys hung out. I was just a young kid who enjoyed the trains and stuff. And I remember, geez, these guys get done and they get to go to a tavern. But not me, I guess. I did my days before I got married like anybody else, but after you got married things changed. 25:38 [What about nicknames?] I don’t remember too much. I was called Red...Brown was called Brownie. Syd was just Syd. Norm was Norm. There were a few guys who had nicknames... Stub...his name was Robbins and he was called Stub. There are a few... [Tinker.] Tinker, yeah. Freitag, we all called him Arnie. Yeah, there were a few nicknames, a few good ones floating around. I used to go to the union meetings quite a bit and we’d talk there because guys worked for different companies. It was interesting on Friday night to sit and talk to some of those old timers. Guys from up north who never got too social. Most of them guys were called  Jackpine Savages in them old days. But they were good guys too. I worked up in Nekoosa and Wausau area and got to meet those guys. It’s a long way for them to come to Madison for a union meeting on a Friday night. So when you got up there to go to work, you used to hear stories about these guys. When you got up there to meet the guys, they weren’t bad guys. They were good guys. [Do you remember any of those stories?] Well, I used to hear about those Jackpine Savages are going to do it their way. Come up here and... “You ain’t coming up here to change things and doing things this way and that way.” I’ve only been up there a couple different times when work was slack. But I loved the guys. They were great guys. I worked at Nekoosa at the power house. Met a lot of guys up there. Worked in Wausau and met some good guys up there. We used to hear stories, like any place else. You hear stories about guys from other part of the local. They were good men, the were all good ironworkers. [That’s what I am – I’m from Rice Lake. I’ve always known about the Jack Pine Savages.] Yeah, the Jackpine Savage. “Where do you live?” “Oh, I live out in the desert belt, out among the pine trees in a trailer.” They love, those guys up north, they love their hunting and fishing. If it was hunting time, they wouldn’t come to work. They’d go hunting. That’s the way it was. You wouldn’t argue with them. [Would guys bring venison sausage or jerky or something to the job?] Well, I was never much into...I never hunted or fished myself and I wasn’t into any of that wild turkey or venison. Guys would bring it and want to share it with you and stuff like that. It was just... It’s hard to say but, you had a good time. Growing up as an ironworker, I grew up. I did. I was young... Like they say, you are full of piss and vinegar. Right? Them old timers, “what are you trying to do, kill this job?” LAUGHS It was that... They had their pace and that was it. But when I became a foreman, my pace was a little more than the old timers. But I got along good with most of the people. Most guys liked working for me that I know of. I see them today and talk to them... 29:22 [What takes a good pusher?] To be a good foreman? Well, you just got to be... You can’t do a lot of hollering. I might have overextended sometimes like everyone else. They all holler. You make a mistake, it could cost a life or something so you got to be very patient with these young kids today. They’re not like when I started, with the old timers. They wouldn’t tolerate nothing. Today, you’d take the kids off the side and help them the best you can. That wasn’t the way it was with those old timers. They had their way. It was like anyone else. [The old timers talk about... What was the background of some of them? Were they farm guys or Germans or Norwegians?] I don’t remember. They were just... You showed up to go to work and these old timers...they were just there. I couldn’t tell you much about them. They were just... You go to work for so and so and just go there and do your best. And hope that he doesn’t holler too loud. 30:50 [Accidents. You said you never fell. Did you have any accidents or...?] I’ve fallen a small...nothing where I’ve been really seriously hurt. My friend Dick Higby and I were working together and he slipped off a metal building and crushed his heel. We were out in the middle of nowhere. I loaded him up in my car and took him to the hospital. Left the company truck and everything right on the job. Next day we were back on it. Honestly, I’ve never seen a guy really get hurt or fall a distance. Maybe...Everett Erstad one time...a piece of iron rolled over and broke his leg. I think that’s the extent of seeing a guy really get hurt. But I was never around someone that really fell far, even though you heard stories and stuff. No, I was pretty lucky.  Maybe if I would have seen someone fall and get hurt real serious, I would have thought no, this wasn’t for me. It’s time to leave. [When you were starting out, did you hear...that an old timer would take you aside during a break, would one of their ways of maybe teaching you by telling you a story about what happened to someone...?] Yeah, they would tell you that you had to be careful. Don’t be a hot dog. It happens quick. [Can you remember any of those old stories?] No, not really offhand. I know the one time I fell, I maybe fell 10 feet. It was like, shit – it happened. I’m here! How did I get here so quick? And right away you want to get up. But I hurt my back a little bit and right away they said, “Take it easy, take it easy, why do you want to be a hero and get up?” And I said, “Oh, I’m alright.” But I never got seriously hurt. It was just...I cracked a rib and that was it. And I thought, well, I’m pretty lucky. [That is lucky.] You hear stories about guys falling and doing this and that. But I was very lucky. Never was around anyone who really got hurt except I remember Everett getting his leg broke. It was just one of those little things--nothing where a guy fell and got killed. I think Higby and Wes Roscoe and a few other guys were working at the chilled water heating plant at the University when that fellow fell down the chimney and got killed. They were there. I heard about that but I wasn’t on the job. But you hear things like that. 33:53 [Can you talk about...say, with a greenhorn ironworker... Did they ever get sent for some tool that didn’t exist?] Oh yeah. You play those games. You send people after things that don’t exist. It’s kind of like when you were kids and you went snipe hunting, right? With a paper bag and you hit them with your finger. Yeah, they send you after things that don’t exist. I don’t remember too much about that. I remember hearing stories about that. [What would they be?] It would be some crazy thing to get. For a rivet or something crazy that they’d send you after in the tool shed. Some people would just laugh at you. I can’t remember, you know... But there were times when they’d send you after stuff and you’d just laugh. You’d learn the next day and you’d think how can I be so silly to believe that? 35:00 [When I went to Pete Stern onto the Findorff site, there was a guy busting iron rods. When he had his back turned, people put some gravel in his bag and any kind of little...pranks? Can you think of anything like that?] Well, you’d always do something like...you know... You might nail a guy’s lunch bucket down. When he comes to pick it up, he’d tear the handle off or... Just crazy things. I had a good friend Virgil. He was a good ol’ ironworker. We used to call him Melon Head because he had a head on him... He had a five gallon bucket for a hard hat. Yeah, those were fun days. Yeah, they pulled a lot of tricks, especially when you were tying rods. With the wire, they’d wire your pliers to the thing or just do crazy things. It was fun. It was all in the game. But nothing serious where anyone...you know. I can’t remember, but there were crazy things that went on. 36:06 [If you are a foreman, what was your attitude toward stuff like that...?] You’ve got to play a little bit. You can’t be serious all the time. I remember at the Kohl Center, a lot of guys played a lot of different silly games. Nothing that would get anyone hurt or at a cost. It was just in fun. But yeah, a guy would be tying rods in a tunnel and you go and tie the top rod so he can’t get out. He’d be stuck in there. Guys would say that they were on a job so big they used to have lunch in the bull hall. The bull halls are so big. Just crazy things, but it was fun. Or you weld somebody’s tool down. Nothing serious, you wouldn’t hurt them or anything. Just tack them to  the iron or something on the guy. It was fun. All those years. [Someone would do that to you or to a person, then you would try to retaliate later on?] Oh yeah, now that we’re talking about it, there’s one thing I could really tell you about welding. The window on your welding hood is kind of like a little piece of glass. One thing I would do when a guy wasn’t looking, I’d cut a piece of paper and stick it in there. He’d strike an arc but he wouldn’t see anything. It was just...”What”?!? Then he’d open his welding hood and look around and then he’d figure it out. You stuck a piece of paper in there. If you know anything about welding... My favorite of all time, now that I’ve been thinking about it... I had a young apprentice one time and a welding rod, if you know anything about welding rod, Jim, you stick it in the holder and when you strike an arc, it sparks. They stuck a sparkler in his things. He struck an arc and it wouldn’t go out. He just got mad, threw his stinger down and walked away. He just kept on going. He didn’t know. That was one of my all time favorites. Sticking a sparkler in a guy’s stinger. He struck an arc and it would just... He would make a face and hold back...and then he finally figured it out. That was one of my all time favorites. [Did you do that when you were a foreman or...] Well, a couple of different times. When I was a foreman, I had a good little apprentice. Joey. Joey Dern. I used to say, “God damn it Joey.” But he was a good kid and apprentice. He was willing to learn. He’d make mistakes so I’d holler at him. Yeah. I pulled little pranks on Joey once in a while but he was all right. But that sparkler was my all time favorite. If you know anyone, talk to any of the other ironworkers, they probably done the same thing. Stuck a sparkler in the stinger. [It sounds like a classic...] Yeah, whenever you go back to school, go down to the shop or something. Ask the guy, “Did you ever stick a sparkler in your stinger?” Stuff like that. That was fun. [Would there usually be an audience for something like that?] No, you kind of... You didn’t want to embarrass the guy real bad. You know? You might tell another guy, [whispers] “Watch this, watch this...” And the guy would strike an arc...because every time you set your bar joist and stuff you have to weld them down, weld both sides and that. The guy would go to coffee break or something, that’s when you would... Just mix a sparkler with a bunch of welding rods. Most guys start welding and just stick it in. It was fun. That was probably the best I’ve had. 40:06 [Did you have a favorite part of the trade that you especially liked to do?] I used to like to connect. When I first worked with Syd [Dick?] Higby a lot, I did a lot of connecting. I had a good old ironworker...well, he’s not old. He’s younger than I am. Nick Rochon. He was a hippy and a good guy. Everyone knows Nick. The hippy dippy guy. He was a good guy. I loved to connect with him. A few of those guys were good connectors I worked with. You’ve probably going to talk... [I’ve seen pictures of Nick...] Norm Brown and all these guys were all there. [You’ll see Nick in this little film...] Yeah, Nick was a good guy. Me and him were going to apprentice school together. We had a lot of fun. 41:05 We used to do crazy things in school too. [Like what?] The guy would be welding in there, just apprentices learning how to weld... The teacher would be teaching. When the guy ain’t looking, you’d turn his welder up to 300 or something. You’d just ruin whatever he was doing and he’d have to start all over. But those were... Things we did in school that we shouldn’t have done. Things have changed. Things are more... I’m taking like 40 years ago. Things have changed. [When you were a connector, you told me you can’t rush things too much but you must also...you want to be fast. Maybe be in competition with other connectors. Could  you talk about that?] Well, you didn’t... Most of the time... I always liked connecting because the time would go fast and you’d get a piece all bolted up and by the time the train turned around and come back, you had done another piece and reach up and grab it. It was fun building that, going up and up. It was very interesting. The bigger the piece, the harder it was. I don’t care what they say. The bigger the iron, the safety factor keeps going up. You start using your head. 42:35 [How important is the crane operator?] The crane operator is probably 99% of the job connecting. He could kill you in a minute. Say you’re up 4 floors and you’re working in the blind. The operator can’t see you and you’re on the telephone or on the walkie-talkie. “Swing to the right easy...swing to the left...boom down...hold the load.” The operator is 99% of the safety factor when you’re connecting. You’re sitting up there on a beam, say 3-4 inches wide. Here comes a beam swinging in and it can’t be coming in 100 miles an hour. You’ve got to be able to reach up and grab it. Once you’ve got a hold of it, the safety factor was better because you knew where it was. You could guide it and do what you want with it. Slide it into position and get your spud wrench in there. Quick put a bolt on there and put the nut on it. It was a big piece, you put 2-3 on. The operator I always liked... Louie Ziegler was a good operator that worked for Kupfer’s for many, many years. Louie lives in Waunakee and is a good friend of mine. A couple of times, things happen, but right away you want to blame the operator. But hey, come on. He’s got a helluva job as it is. Picking up a piece, trying to swing it over, get it right where you want it. I would say operator engineers, if you’ve got a good crane operator, you could make well progress on a job. Setting iron always was one of the things that was taught. This is how we make money: so many pieces a day for the company. You try to get that many pieces as you could. Once in a while, you got one in backwards. Then you got to go back and take it all apart and turn it end for end. You know... Most of your iron has a number on one end or the other. And most guys would mark that iron Red’s end or Norm’s end. Put an R or an N. So when you’re connecting, you knew which piece...so it was in right. [So that was your ground man?] Yeah, the ground man would write north, south, east or west or put your initial on it, which helped. So when an iron come up and you’d grabbed it, and you’re a connector, you’d say, “Oh, that’s my end.” So what you do is give it a spin. Then he’d grab it. That way you got it in. Times happen when you do get ‘em in backwards. Then you have to take it apart and you got to change it. It’s like a bar joist. Bar joists all have a tag at the end. They tell you 3-4, 35th. All bottom joists had numbers. And according to your blueprint, you’d put them up by this, whichever way they were. The tag...the tag end is marked. And you get one in backwards, then you have to get it back up, turn it. That would cost money, right? And if you owned the company, “What happened here? What took so long?” And you always had a superintendent come out and check on you, which was part of his job. [Would you use hand signals some too?] Oh yeah, yeah. When you’re signaling, “boom down” – you’d put your thumb down. Pump your fingers, that means boom down or hold the load or just boom up. Swing right or left. When you’re on the telephones it’s the same thing. Swing down. Hold it. Boom down easy, a little bit. You’d always be talking. The operator is always working the crane. You hear a lot of stories where operators...things happen. I know when I was on the Executive Board, that young man fell down in Dubuque on the bridge. He was young...I think his name was Woodhouse. A young gentleman that fell off the arch there, down at Dubuque by the bridge. I understand that he fell off of there and landed on the barge. The crane operator just froze, they said, and he couldn’t... It was a shock. I wasn’t there. Homer [Ingram] was the business agent then and I was on the  Executive Board. We heard them stories. 47:30 [Would you ever ride the load up?] Oh yeah, you’d ride the load a lot of times. But you can’t do that no more. Two guys, guy on each end and you’d ride it up and its inside of a column when you get it up there. You can’t do that no more. [Tell me what that was like though.] You just sat on it and just hope that the other guy kept his spot. You had a hold of the tie and you worked your way up. It was exciting, sitting there and riding the load. Of course you can’t do that any more. Like when you were on a big job, you used to jump on the headache ball and the crane operator would let you down, you know, at lunch and coffee break. Two-three guys would get on and hang on to each other. You can’t do that no more. We were in the old days. 48:22 [What about the weather? Whether it was wet, cold or...] Yeah, it was... The old time ironworkers used to tell you, you know, “First drop of rain is God’s fault. The second one is yours.” You know what I’m saying? [I’m not sure.] You’re at work and the first drop of rain hits you, that’s God’s fault. The second one hits you, and that means get off the job. Do you know what I’m saying? The old timers...it would rain, we’d go and head for the tavern. We’d wait it out but yeah, that was their favorite saying. First one is God’s fault and the second one is your own. [Are the beams slippery?] Oh yeah they are very... Like in the winter time I worked at American Family for Kenneth F. Sullivan back then. That big complex of American Family Insurance. We used to have blow torches with a couple of good guys working for me. I was kind of one of the structural foremen working there. I had Don Wigdal who was a good friend of mine who passed away. Jerry Roscoe was an ironworker. He’s still around. Jerry would pick out the iron for me and Wiggy would take the blow torch and try to melt the ice and stuff before it went up. But you had to be very careful. Snow, weather... A lot of times they’d shut the job down. Too cold. Too much snow. Too windy. You can’t be raising iron three floors and they’d come up spinning like a top. No, no, no. You’ve got to be very careful. But in the winter, you did your best. No one wanted to go home. When I started, I made $2.10/hour and I was married. It was tough. But I made a good living and I enjoyed it. 50:32 [Tell me about climbing columns and the art to that.] There was an art to it for guys to do it but I was never very good at it. Norm Lenzer, now that was a guy who could climb iron. You don’t do it any longer. You used to shimmy up and tie them, you’d get the foot in the web. You could get up there pretty good. Sit up there, and a piece of iron would come, you could get it. Once you got in, you climbed up and sat on it. Yeah, I remember some guys were really good at shimmying iron, they’d call it “shimmying iron,” y’know, they’d get right up there. But me, I wasn’t worth a damn. [Is there a term for walking the beam too?] No, not that I... You could “beaver it.” That’s if you sat down. Put your feet on the bottom and go across. “What are you beavering the iron for? Get up and walk it like a man.” “Naw, I’m fine this way. That way I’ll go across the bottom.” LAUGHS 51:35 But you were talking about fooling around... Now that it came to me. One time we kinda pulled a trick on a guy. He had a bolt bag. We filled both bolt bag with things when he had to shimmy up the column. Probably had 50 pounds of tools on it and he was just an apprentice, you know. “Naw, you don’t do that.” It’s just crazy things. You’ve got two bolt bags on and they were pretty good size. Then you’d throw different sized bolts... Fill ‘em both up for a guy and  he’s an apprentice... “There you are. Go to work.” Yeah, that was fun. We’d sit and reminisce these old times. It’s good... It’s too bad we don’t have more get-togethers of old time ironworkers. Some companies go out once a month and they have a breakfast. Guys sit around and get to reminisce old times. It’s never happened. Old ironworkers, I don’t know why it is. It just seems like things have changed. We don’t play around any more. 52:40 [What about when OSHA came in. Could you tell about before...] I hated OSHA. Them guys...they didn’t use common sense. They just...come in. That fining crap all the time. You’re better off just to leave the job if you know they’re coming. You could save the company money. I mean, they are there for a reason but it’s pretty hard to tell an old timer how to change his way. It took a lot of adjustment, even for me, for OSHA’s rules and regulations. Being tied off. That’s the way it had to be. OSHA was OSHA. It’s the government and you can’t argue with them. [I think every once in a while people do ignore some of the things.] You could get by but don’t get caught. There’s a difference. You can do certain things. It’s like driving your car. You’re supposed to wear seat belts. How many times do you put it on? Sooner or later, you’re going to get caught. 53:55 [How about your involvement with the local.] I was a trustee for a few years. A trustee looks over the bills to make sure of things. Then I got on the Executive Board with Homer and those guys and I was on that for a few years. It was kind of nice, though it took a lot of time and stuff. You went there and tried to keep everyone happy. Negotiated contracts a couple of times. Tried to get a raise. Do this and do that. Try to keep the local solvent and keep everyone happy. You’re there and guys would come and complain about this and that. So you had to make sure everyone was happy, one big happy family. Yeah, I enjoyed being on the Board with the old time ironworkers, the old timers and young guys. [What were the meetings like when you first started out?] Well, when I was a trustee, we would just go...a couple...another guy would just go through the bills, make sure there’s nothing there that ain’t supposed to be. Try to keep the locals solvent basically. Then you got on the Executive Board and you had a meeting before and you kind of discuss this and that. Then you had the Board meeting and the union guys were there. The Executive Board was actually mostly there for negotiating the contract. You wanted to have good guys on the board, try to get you that dollar raise or that dollar fifty raise. Try to sit down with the contractors and be fair. You can’t... I always thought, when I was a young guy, you can’t go in there and tell the contractor, “Well, Jesus Christ. We need a $5/hour raise.” Well, you know... Think about it. $5/hour. And there were times when we would negotiate and we’d come back to the body and they were never happy. The body was never happy with what you came back. You had to sit down, there were five of us. You had all the contractors and they are negotiating with all the trades, not just the ironworkers. You can’t give one trade a $2/hour raise and then another trade a .50/hour raise. The carpenters, ironworkers, electricians, plumbers, you had to stay... I always thought that the contractors knew exactly what they were going to give you, even when we went on strike a few times. We went on strike and came back and got what they wanted to give us. They were going to give you a dollar and that was it. You could sit and argue with them for days... You’d want a dollar an hour raise for the next three years when you’re signing a three year contract. Or a $1.25, $1.50... But I always thought the contracts knew exactly what they were going to give you before you sat down at the table. That was kind of the hard part of being on the negotiating committee. The body was never happy. I don’t  care... You could settle for $5 and come back and someone would say, “Why didn’t we get $6?” Yeah know? [What about when pensions came in and guys had to pay into their...] Oh yeah, we started paying into the pension. I was one of them guys that kind of thought at first... “Why in the hell do I need someone to take care of my money?” You know? But as you think about it, and sat with other people, if it wasn’t for that pension plan we have now, there would be a lot of guys in big trouble. I mean...it’s a good pension plan. It pays ironworkers a pretty good pension and that. Old timers, “No--no, no!” They didn’t want nobody touching their money. I was kind of in that group a little bit. Not 100% , but why did I have to pay someone to take my money. But now when you think about it, it’s not such a bad deal. When I retired, I had my money in the SMA. You know about our pension, being an ironworker. Doing what you’re doing. You have your pension. You have your SMA. You can either merge it or take it out separately. I took my pension, of course... I have cancer so I took 50-50 so my wife, if something happened, she’d get a nice settlement. But I took my SMA and went to a financial advisor. I’ve done pretty well with it. The money I got, I got some $100,000 or whatever it was. Went to a financial advisor and advised me... I didn’t want to be a millionaire, but I didn’t want to loose my money. I need this and he knew what my pension was. Yeah, it was very hard to get them old timers, including myself, to believe in the pension. I’m not one of those guys that’s going to deny it. I’ve said it and they know that I’ve said it. “We don’t need people taking care of our money.” Now that you think about it, it was a good deal. So you can call me an old timer. LAUGHS 1:00:10 [I wanted to ask about the relationship between ironworkers and other trades...] “Well, those God damn scabby carpenters. They’re terrible.” I’ll be honest with you. That’s the feeling we all got. Them damn scabby carpenters and laborers all want to do our work. That was a lot that was going on back in those days. They used to say, everyone hated carpenters. Everyone used to try to steal everyone’s work. That wasn’t a good part about it. You still hear that today on the job. It’s too bad the trades can’t get along. I think if the trades got along, they’d be a lot better, work wise and getting things done. But other than that, we still have that hard feeling between the guys. [Did you have any run-ins with the carpenters?] Oh yeah. When we were on strike, the carpenters were doing our work and stuff. We’d have to put a picket up and everyone hated us in those days. I remember when they were doing the campus square if you remember when they were going around. Joe Daniels was doing the work up there. We did a lot of protesting up there. [This spring you mean?] No, this was years and years ago when we were... Oh, I don’t remember. When they first started doing the fountains and stuff up town and all that work was going on. They still have that problem. You know... I still go and visit my friends at Badgerland and Sullivan. Marty Ballweg, I stop to see Marty whenever I can. He’s with Ideal now. You still have that carpenters and laborers, especially on road construction. The laborers are doing a lot of tying rods and stuff like that. You still have that problem. [Laying down concrete?] Yeah, like laying the rebar out there. If you ever get out on a bridge deck, the rods go two different ways. They are dipped in that paint, in that epoxy paint. Their paint is mostly green now. Yeah, that’s... You bring that up about... Yeah, the trades, they all hate each other. They really don’t hate each other but, you know, carpenters... Everyone hated carpenters. Every ironworker... [I have some guys I know out in Mount Horeb. Some are laborers, some are sheet metalworkers but a couple carpenters...and they say... “Jim, you’re working with ironworkers? Aren’t you going to interview anyone skilled?] Yeah, skilled all right! Some of them carpenters, all they can do is put up forms. They’re not...trade carpenters? Go ask them to go build a cabin  or something like that. There are some very good carpenters. But talking about crazy things: some of the crazy things that went on at the Kohl Center. Oscar J. Boldt. There was carpenters and laborers and ironworkers, always pulling funny things. The Kohl Center, you had a carpenter in the basement, a carpenter on first floor, a carpenter on second floor building the sky boxes and stuff. Every carpenter had their own gang box, full of his own tools. The best thing about doing that was take tools out of one tool box and put them in another, from floor to floor. I used to have a good friend who was a foreman there and he’d--blueprints were like 2-300 pages--he’d be working on something and when he wasn’t looking, I’d turn the page, 3-4 pages. He’d come back in and start looking at one of them. “I’m on the wrong page.” [Laughs.] Or take a piece of black tape and put it over the end of the transit [i.e. transit compass]. [Laughs.] Now that we think about it, some of those crazy things that went on, it was fun. Other than that, you know, I really enjoyed the trade. I loved what I did or I wouldn’t have stayed as long as I did. I met a lot of great people. Sometimes I miss it. I’m 70 years old and I know I can’t do it no more. It was fun. The best I can tell you, it was fun. [I think this is a really good interview. We did an hour and 5 minutes.] It was fun, yeah, it was fun.
Ironworkers;Everett J. Erstad;Topic  Announcement, initial question–when and where born, how you got into ironworkers  Time  0:02 trade?  0:28  up on the east side of Madison, 2941 Milwaukee Street. And it’s always been, our whole family’s been in the construction trade. I had two uncles, a cousin, and my father. And you find that nepotism was pretty prominent in a lot of trades in the Madison area. And I had an uncle that was a cement finisher in the Vogel, and I got a cousin that was a laborer in the summer. He went to college. So I had an uncle, after the Second World War was over, he got into the trade and stayed at our house. And the discussion at a lot of our suppertime was talking about upcoming jobs and  I was born in Madison General Hospital on the west side of Madison in 1941. And I grew  who’s doing what, where, and where they’re traveling to get the work don--and carrying on from there. And I always took an interest in it, and when I got out of high school I was kind of rambling around. And the shop in the main company, it was a sub-contractor, Kupfer Ironworks, they were located just about four blocks from the house. So when we’d go down to the park you could hear, over the tracks, all that banging and clanging and stuff. And that’s where my father worked. And I took my mother’s suggestion, why don’t you go over there and see if you can get a summertime job, something to start out with, see what they’re doing. And I went in there and, first thing you know, they seen who I was and they pushed me right in the office. Next thing: “A big strapping kid like you,” he says, “I think we put you out in the field. You don’t want to work in the shop.” The shop scale was a lot less, ‘cause all they did was fabricate there and stuff. So they signed me up for an apprenticeship program, and it wasn’t long before I was out working on different projects.  2:36 The one I started out with was, let’s see here, in the summer it was down in Hartford [WI], putting new schools in. School building was going great guns at that time. We worked the summer there. And then in the winter, it was on top on the 9th floor on Oscar Mayer’s on the east side of Madison, tying re-rods. Some apartment buildings, we’d put a slab in, tie re-rods and stuff like that. I was into reinforcing rods more so than structural starting out. I think they wanted to beef me up you might say. Then we progressed from there. After the apprenticeship was over with and I stayed with Kupfer for 13 years. Then when I got laid off from there, I went with Helga Steel. It’s a metal building contractor, they call them. They work on pre-designed buildings. I worked for them for 8 years. They’re no longer around but they have some sons in excavating down in the Janesville area. He had a twin engine Golden Eagle 8-seater Cessna. He travels around the country. We would go up to northern Minnesota in Rush City. We had a project up there for Fox. What they do was, the outfit with all the snow mobilers and stuff like that. It’s a fair sized metal building job up there. And then we went there to Indiana. We were down there about 10-11 months. We spent a week out in Local 10, I think in Kansas City or Independence. From there I worked with a lot of the local contractors. JP Cullen, Findorff, a lot of different things we were picking up around here. Then I got a phone call from a company that splintered from Helga Steel. It was Debco out of Janesville. They said, “How would you like to spend a winter down in North Carolina?” And that sounded pretty good. I said, well, “How are expenses?” “Well, all your expenses are paid. Motel is paid.” And they guaranteed you Rockford scale, which was like $7 more an hour than around here. I’d spend a winter down there. It’s hard to get a guarantee forty [hours a week] the construction trade. That’s the reason some people think we’re getting rich but it’ really not the case. LAUGHTER It used to be, when my father was in the trade, it was a seasonal thing. It was 9-10 months out of the year and then things would quiet down. Because they didn’t have any way of pouring the concrete and stuff until they get the additives now and the chemical changes and stuff. Now it’s a year round thing, weather permitting, which it makes it kind of tough. Yeah, that’s... Then I went from there and worked for Findorff, off and on.  6:15 I had a chance to get in with Klein-Dickert Glass putting curtain wall up. I worked for them, off and on, and when they got slack I went to work with the glazers, 50-50. They needed a certified welder and I was certified. They got a lot of embedded plates and concrete. I would go up and weld bolts on it and stuff so they could drill holes in it, fasten the curtain wall and then    help them put the glass in place. [So this is for these, for the First Wisconsin buildings, the ones with glass exterior?] Yeah. I’ve got a picture of it. One of the things with that one... It was taken out of the paper. GETS PICTURE Here it is. That’s the Mullins Building on the north side of the square. Where they had that fire? That’s right around the corner. See that? You know where the Strand Theatre used to be? [Yes.] That’s it. I’m on the end there...it’s pretty hard to make it out. I saw that in the paper and I said, “Hey, that’s me!” LAUGHTER [Cool.] I was working down on different, smaller projects for Klein-Dickert...and then would go off with Findorff or the local contractors. If we hit...  7:50 If I back track a little bit, I remember when things got slack here and we were on strike, I went down to Byron, Illinois, and worked on that nuclear plant on the second shift doing cad welding. That was an experience and a half to work on a big plant like that. That thing is near 300 feet or better. And it’s a dome-shaped facility. Then we had to go inside and tie the re-rods for their inside there. The mat was two layers and they were about 5 foot, 4 or 5 feet thick. You didn’t want to slip and fall and straddle it because that would raise your voice quite a bit. LAUGHS But that was an experience and a half working there. An old timer was there with me and he brought a camper down and we stayed at Lake Louise. It’s about maybe ten miles north of there. That was pretty nice. Otherwise it would have been an 80-90 mile hour drive.  8:55 That’s the trouble with the trades. The fact that the work isn’t always local. You’ve got to go where the work is. I spent some time in Milwaukee when work slacked here. I remember hooked up with, I think the conversation was with Nick Rochon. This was back in the 60s when we were on strike. Nick was still an apprentice. Then we hooked up and went to Milwaukee, working on the interstate bridges back then. That was a lot of fun. A different experience, different people you know. A larger local, but they needed the bodies. You might say that, you’re working on bridges like over the Milwaukee River and different places there. As far as the eye could see, that’s what you had to get done. You’re tying, it’s like you’re bent over, tying shoe laces all day long. You carry a reel of wire. I think it’s about 750 feet. When you make a tie, it’s about 4 inches, 5 inches or so. Then they would want you to carry a bag with you. The only break you had was to walk back and get some more wire. But they wanted you to carry a bag with you and have two or three rolls with you so when you straighten up, they’d slap another roll so you get right back down there tying again. You get used to it but then again, you don’t. It wears on you the older you get. It’s not an easy job. [Like picking cotton.] Yeah. A lot of guys don’t do it but it pays the bills, you might say. A lot of people say, well, you’re an ironworker. It’s all structural. That’s only a fraction of what’s actually going on. I think there’s 7 different union books in it. Reinforcing, actually right now in the local... I talked with the business agent yesterday. Reinforcing has more work than there is in construction and all the other stuff. I know when I was at the convention back in 1996, they had to include--they said the ironworkers, structural and ornamental, they never included reinforcing. So they added that in to our sign, to put reinforcing in there because it’s as important as the rest of it, if not more.  11:45 Working down in Milwaukee, there were several different projects. I worked on the new federal building, supervised putting the tubes between the two towers in the new federal building down town. I think they were 16 inches tall and it’s like 7 inches wide. They were about 15-20 feet long. We had to tailor make them to round columns and they had embedded plates. We had    to weld them up. They put scaffolds out for us and we welded them. Then the tower crane to swing the piece out and hook it up. We weld them up. At times, we’d work out at Jones Island, which is a sewage plant out there. They added on that...they’re doing that... It’s on going all the time, one thing or its something else out there. Then I went on the north end of town and put up  a warehouse over there... I and three other guys. When work got slack and then they brought in another supervisor. And they said, “Well, as long as you’ve made supervisor and you’re in another local, we’ll see you. You’re going back.” Boom. LAUGHTER They were protecting their own work because its their local. It’s only fair. We do the same thing here. It’s a territorial thing, you know. It’s like a cat fighting over a mouse.  13:15 [Let me back up to make sure I get your uncle’s name and your dad’s name.] Milford Grove was my uncle and he was in the Army Air Force. He came home and got right into the ironworkers because things were starting to break. [He’s your mother’s...] Right. And my father was Sydney Erstad. He was a steelworker, machinist. Just as... He worked for Gisholt Machine Company, which is on East Washington Avenue. Then he went down... Things were picking up and he went down to Fairbanks and Morris in Beloit. What he was doing... They were machining parts for the submarines for the Second World War. Then what happened, he had an opportunity to go over to Hawaii in about 1942-43 to be part of this... They had to upgrade their submarines because their engines weren’t functioning proper. They were having a lot of problems with them so they’d send them over there. He was over there for 3-4 years, something like that. Then he come back and got into the ironworks. From there on in, he had over 50 years in. I got about six different copies of that, toward the tail end of that. Looking through the trunks and different things, I found a bunch of copies. It’s quite interesting. [Pearl Harbor Banner, newspaper clipping.] Yeah,  15:20 [Do you know when and where your dad was born and...] Up in Windsor-Deforest. He grew up on a farm there. His grandparents come from Norway on my father’s side. I think it was one generation off from my mother, and its kind of a long story in that respect. My grandfather on my mother’s side...he was born in Oklahoma. What happened there is... I don’t know if he was part of the Oklahoma rush for land down back then. It was 1870s-1880s. Anyway, his father, they found him in a spring...he had died. But he had an injury in the Civil War. He was over at the spring for some reason or another and they found him the next day. So his mother was from Darlington, Wisconsin, which is just west of here. She decided to get on the train and take little Johnny, which was my grandfather’s name, and move back up to Darlington. It was such a long period in Darlington, waiting for their relatives to pick them up that she caught pneumonia. Back then there wasn’t much...going on there. Anyway, so she died. So he was adopted. Come to find out that his name was changed from Paterson to Grove. And then the Grove, the people that adopted him, that was their name I guess. They sent him a couple of years to the university in advanced agriculture. He got into farming and that was his thing, doing the farming stuff. Part of the history of that is that they found out later that the land they owned down there, it was all oil wells. So my two uncles and a cousin went down to pursue it and they found a relative, this Bennett guy... GIGGLE They looked into it and he was a pastor at a local church. “Oh yeah, they used to own such and such land here and stuff... Oh yeah, they lost the right to it because the fact that they burned down the courthouse.” I hear it the second, third, fourth hand, it’s hard to say...but that’s history for you. That’s where they come from. My    uncle...at the WWII, I had five uncles in the service. Two of them got into the trades, along with my father.  18:25 [What was it like, growing up on the east side? Can you talk about it as a working class...?] Oh yeah, all working class. We spent our time at the local ball park, close to... Kupfer Iron Works, which is across the tracks... We’d play for business...and compete at different parks. See who was the better guy in their age group. We’d compete back and forth. We’d go swimming in the summer and fishing down at the local creek. Starkweather Creek was close by and you’d catch little bullheads and carp. That was about all that was edible, the bullheads. The carp would just steal your bait. Then we’d go down to the lake and fish down there, and go swimming and stuff. That was... I had a paper route at 11 or 12. I followed through with that, my brother and I. We both had two routes that joined each other. We had to stop that after a year. He was sixteen, caught cancer and died within a matter of three months. It was a tumor of the arm and it just passed through him before they could cut off his arm. He was 16 and I was 14. Boy, talk about something that’s hard to deal with... So I quit the paper route and I became a part time...average... Dykeman’s Restaurant up town on the square. I cut up stuff and cleaned pots and pans. Yeah. Cut up vegetables and different things. We’d cry with this other guy, cutting up the onions and all the business like that. That didn’t pay very well. Then I finished school and got into the ironworks business.  20:25 At the time, we started out at 2/3rds scale. Then you work your way up. As you get 1000 hours in, you get an increase in wages and stuff. A lot of the friends I knew back then, the jobs that they had were pretty much mediocre compared to what I had. I had a pretty good deal going, really, at the time, because wages were just increasing. I remember... We used to go out to fight for wages and stuff and it would be a nickel, a dime, 15 cents. You think about it, it barely kept up with the cost of living. There was a lot of argument and carrying on. It was quite interesting to be part of that business. There would be a lot of scuffling and stuff and people would want to go on strike. Some wouldn’t because they’d loose their wages and didn’t want to go out of town to work for another local. Their time to go on strike is different than ours. Their contract is different, different timing. It worked out a lot. If they had a lot of work, they would absorb as many people as they could...to help us out. Then we’d work the other way around which was pretty nice. There’d be some scuffling and there’d be some fights. A guy would be hitting down at the bar afterwards and everyone would want to argue this and carry on.  21:55 [So what year was it that you started? 1959?] 1959, July. The same time as Tinker Nelson. We went in and both got our pins and stuff and watch for our 50 year business at the same time. [Some people have talked about just starting out. I think Gus Peplinski didn’t really have a formal apprenticeship. He just got the permit and then started out.] When you start out, if you’re in an apprenticeship program, like I say, you start with 2/3rds scale and you work your way up. Well if they got a whole pile of work and not overload us with apprentices, because they’re locked into them, what they’ll do is put on a lot of permit guys. If a permit guy gets so many hours in, he has a right to go for a union book. Ok? But there was a little agitation there because of the fact that I was working at 2/3rds scale and he was making full scale. We’re working right along side one another and I know a lot more than what this man does. So there was some agitation there in that respect. But I know he was going to be temporary help. So he    was there six months, eight months, and some cases longer. But the thing was I was making less money and doing the same thing he was, which was a little agitating. Because he just come off the street and then he started throwing his weight around a little bit. LAUGHS [Did you get special training as an apprentice?] Oh yeah. You had to go to school once a week and spend the whole day there. I don’t know what it is now. You had to get so many hours in. That would be for the 9 months school year, from September through June. You’d get the summer off and then the following year you do that, for three years, until you had your... And then you had to try to get certified. One of the courses they give you is how to get you certified. It would be a welding course. You’d have a teacher looking over your shoulder all the time. Have a written test and stuff like this. We had blueprint reading, knot tying that we created ourselves because they didn’t have any of that there at MATC, uptown, that’s where it was at the time. They had it in the upper half of Central High School in the downtown area. Now it’s way out on the east side. It’s just the 9 months. Once you got your hours in and stuff, then you had to go sit down and have a test.  24:52 We changed that test quite a bit. I was on the examining committee for several years. Each time you get elected to something it’s a three year stretch. I was on the executive board for three years. I forget how many times I was on the examining board, maybe six years. Then I was a trustee. They signed the bills and coordinate all the election stuff. They count the ballots and everything like that. Then I played sargeant of arms. That was a three year deal where you stand by the door and guard the door. Anybody gets pesky, you got to grab them and throw them out. But that never happens. It happened before I got there though. They used to get pretty loud mouth in there. People get to drinking, right after work, and the meeting wouldn’t be until 8 and it’s on a Friday night. You’re already getting warmed up. If there’s a strike or you didn’t get enough money on your contract...when you send the guys out to represent the local. “You didn’t get enough, you SOB.” Oh geez... It could be a real picnic sometimes. Then you’d laugh about it for a week afterwards. Yeah.  26:19 Companies... Kupfer was a pretty prominent company to work for. It was a good thing I got in with them. It was a subcontractor. Basically they got all the raw steel... They had a franchise for Bethlehem or Inland. They’d get the raw parts of the metal in and shape it all up, cut it and whatever is needed in the shop. Then they’d ship it out to the projects or we’d work on it and put it together for them. The good thing is...they did a lot of their own work because in fact, a lot of it didn’t fit so we had to go out there. We’d always complain about it but then the main guy in the office said, “Well, if everything didn’t fit perfect, there would be no use to having ironworkers around.” LAUGHS Then again, I got into with Helga Steel, now that was what  they called A pre-engineered building. They had all this stuff...cut and everything like this. They did it all in their shop. And what they said was, “Well, you want100,000 square foot, 200,000 square foot...” Everything is pre-designed so they just...well, take 2, 3, or 4 of that length and 2, 3, or 4 of that length and they just slapped it together. All that stuff is pre-made. And then it’s all metal building of course. Insulation and stuff. It was a different experience.  When you started out working, some people talked about the old time ironworkers being a different breed. Could you talk maybe about some characters and old hands that made an impression on you?] Oh yeah. Their language wasn’t, you might say, real kosher. LAUGHS I have to chuckle sometimes about how you had to get their attention. This guy would let out a    bunch of those foul mouth words. Construction workers are known for it. I’d look at him and I’d say, “You certainly have a way with words.” LAUGHS The guy, he’d look at you dumbfounded like... Well, who is getting the last laugh on this one. It was funny. And the guy said, “I hope you guys all took a bath because it seems as though I gotta kiss your ass to get the work out of you here today.” LAUGHTER [He was a pusher...] Yeah, pusher, grumbler or screamer... It’s... I forget all the... There were others and more of that business. Guys a’grumbling... Let’s see..  29:20 You’d get together at picnics and things and see a lot of the guys and hear stories, a lot of different ones. It was quite amusing bunch of guys, characters... They all loved their beer, whisky or whatever. Sometimes they’d have it on the job, you might say. Like when we worked on a project... Nick Rochon and I worked out of Milwaukee on one of the bridges. They sent us out on the north end of town. Silver Springs I think is out there somewhere... On an overpass. We were tying rods and he said, “Well, this is Ole Olson’s job... The guy is coming back with coffee now. Take your break underneath the bridge.” So Nick and I went underneath the bridge. And we’re thinking, “Why the hell do we gotta go underneath there?” Here he comes around the corner, he’s got a six pack of 16 ounce Schlitz. We’re drinking...and we looked around... We were drinking Schlitz first thing in the morning. You’d never see that in Madison. They’d throw us off the job. It was funny. And other one...a few weeks later, we were working on one of those long bridges. They had ordered the concrete for the following morning and they weren’t getting done. So what do they do? Okay...everybody, take a break now. They come out with 3-4 cases of beer and set them out by the edge of the job. Drink what you can and let’s get back at it.  Guys would drink 2-3 of them down. They were sweating. I mean, you sweat it all out before you know it. Then we’re right back up there and finish up so they can pour concrete first thing in the morning. Yeah, it was funny.  31:00 [Who were some of the characters here in Madison, in Local 383, some of the old timers?] PAUSE I’m trying to think of somebody who... PAUSE I’m thinking more... I can’t... [It doesn’t come to you right away...] No, no... It’ll come to me.  31:40 [Can you talk about...when you’re starting out...did anyone send you on a fool’s errand or play a trick on you? Send you for a tool that doesn’t exist?] Yeah, yeah. When I was an apprentice, starting out, you know, they says, “Why don’t you go into the truck and find a bolt stretcher?” And that was a common thing. A bolt stretcher. I forget some of the other ones. They’d play it on everyone. It goes down the chain, of course. Sometimes the guys are warned ahead of time. “I can’t find it... What the hell is a bolt stretcher? LAUGHS [Why do you think people do that?] They’re testing you. They’re looking over you and they’re just laughing. They’re getting their kicks. He’s just a greenhorn. We got to kind of put him on the spot. Whatever. Some of these guys get a little pumped up right away. “I’m an ironworker.” Some of the guys have a pretty big head on them. But it’s funny. Bolt stretcher is one I can remember right off. There was other ones too. One tends to forget over the years. [That’s true. You’ve  got to have something that jogs your memory. Pranks...did someone do something to someone’s tool belt or their...?] Yeah, well, you had a wrench laying there and a guy would heat it up with a cutting torch. He knows you’re on break or went to the can or something like that. And you reach over and pick it up... “Geez...what in the hell...?” It would get your interest up right    away. They had these big carts with oxygen and settling in them and they had big caster wheels. They’d haul ‘em from place to place. I know I played a trick on a guy once. He went to coffee and I turned the tanks off. That’s a common trick. But then I took the thing and wheeled it over on the hose so none of the stuff would go through. So he turned the tanks on...and looked around... “You son of a gun...” And he forgot to turn... I had him buffaloed...peeking around, looking at him, ya know... CHUCKLES Yeah... [So you tipped the other guys...?] Oh yeah, you gotta tell everybody. “Look at the fool!” LAUGHTER [When someone does that to ya, are you going to do something... Do they get you back?] Oh yeah, most of the time...and then some. LAUGHS That’s a...Interesting characters, my dad would talk about it at length. I forget a lot of that stuff that he told me but it was funny. Guys would get themselves into predicaments.  35:15 [Nicknames... Did you ever have one or...?] Eeegor. She [my wife] got such a kick out of it, I have a plate, a personal [license] plate with Eeegor on it. I got tagged with that... I was working down in Indiana. Eeegor. LAUGHS [What meaning does that have, do you think?] I have no idea. Someone came up with it and bam, there it is. And then there are E’s. Eeegor. You mention that to someone and they say, yeah, that’s him over there. Like Tinker Nelson. Big Red is another guy. [That’s Bill Kerwin?] Yup. Big Red. Yup. He’s a motormouth, that guy, he’s a talker. We had gotten together with another friend of ours that worked together, Charlie Gorey. I worked with him for 8-10 years. He lives up in Madison. He’s retired from the ironworkers and he went into maintenance work at the city library. I don’t think his knees or feet were working the best. And you see a lot of guys who get into their mid-40s and early 50s and look for something a little easier. It can be stressful. It’s harder to get out of the hall sometimes too [i.e. to get a job]. They want these young guys, they want these runners. I was fortunate enough to hang in there. I got lucky enough to get in with a company like Klein-Dickert where you don’t have to get around, snake around 8-9 floors in structural. You work on platforms.  Like you see in this picture here. That’s where most of your work is being done. It’s a lot nicer. The aluminum was a lot lighter than iron too. It’s not like the rebars that were solid. I was working down in Byron. The vertical bars were #18s, that’s an 1/8th inch for every point. Then the horizontals were #14s, so you had to use double wire all the time to tie ‘em up. But then the vertical, the #18s, were all cadwelded. But we worked on a project on Madison Meriter Hospital on the parking ramp. That was G-locked. I don’t know if you’ve heard about G-locks before. It’s #14s and they were butted together. You smack a sleeve around it and it would be 2/3rds around. You slip a sleeve on there, they had a little bin on it, a little return. When you slip that sleeve on it, it would slip into place. But to get it to go, you had to take a five pound beater and just beat it down in there. It would lock it in. That was the first time I had an experience with that.  38:20 There’s another thing I can think of. I was working up at that particular parking ramp. They were blasting the footings for that. It’s built on a limestone quarry, Madison General or Meriter Hospital. It’s all limestone under there. They drag a mat that’s 12 inch by 12 inch cable. They drag it over the top. Then they throw a bunch of oversized rocks that they dug out of another whole on top of that. When they got that all drilled and all the wires into it ahead of time for us, they drop their dynamite in there. Then they tell the hospital so they’re not operating or something. Then they popped the thing. When they pop it, one of the rocks... They didn’t have    enough rocks on it and one of the rocks flew out in the middle of South Park Street. LAUGHS The thing was about this big – it would have taken out a wind shield! GIGGLE I can’t... And these guys got it a little short, you know? GEEZ... Little things like that happen from time to time. Its funny. Nobody got hurt. You think about it though.  39:45 [Some of these things that happen on the job are amazing. Could you tell me more about Bill and Nick at the Kohl Center?] Well, it wasn’t at the Kohl Center, it was on Langdon Street. It was on a sorority house if I remember right. What they had done... There was a tower crane on there. And Bill Kerwin was sitting on the center part, my understanding, and Nick Rochon was out toward the end by the counter weight. When the picked it up, they evidently had the cables ahead of the counter weight. When they picked it up, the end of the boom buckled. Nick disappeared over the edge. And Big Red was flying out there like a flying rod, you know? And Nick said, “You MF’s are trying to kill me!” LAUGHTER [Did you ever have an accident or a close call?] Well, she’s chuckling [Ev’s wife]. That’s a dead give away, isn’t it? Yeah, I put her on the edge of the seat a few times. I was working on Stoughton high school and I had a 4 and a half ton beam roll over on my ankle. She’s giggling again. Quit it. We had a three year old son and she was like 7-8 months along. It was a busy time for us. I’m walking around, about 6-8 weeks off...on crutches. I think when you’re off, during that time, it’s $62 or $70 week. That’s it. That’s your compensation. Sometimes in the union hall and the following union meeting, they would pass the hat and you might get 80 bucks or something like that. Which is nice, the guys come through for you. That’s one situation. That was my left ankle. Okay. Now the next one.  I took a dive... I was working on a nursing home in Stoughton. Stoughton is a bad place for me to be in. LAUGHS [Even for a Norwegians eh?] Yeah. I took a dive off the wall. Someone pilfered my ladder. They come down...and everyone disappeared for coffee. So I went looking for it. I didn’t realize this, one joist wasn’t welded. It just skipped... I took a dive and landed on the corner of a black wall with my arm right here. Broke my arm. Knocked the wind out of me and I’m laying there on a pile, not able to get my wind. A person walking down the side walk took it all in and he come over...and I couldn’t say anything. And he says, “What can I do?” I said... “The guys are all up in the trailer having coffee. Get them down here.” So they hauled me off of there. That worked out because then the following Saturday, I think we took off for California for 3 weeks. I was collecting the $70/week and we had already planned the trip with my parents. So we went on a three week-er. I’m limping around on crutches. I bruised my hip.  I had crutches for about a week until my hip felt better. That was... The other one that I  had...to retire on. I was 59. This happened in October of 2000. I was working with Klein-Dickert on the new pharmacy building. We were going to jump one of these rigs. What you’ve got to do is... I’m going down the ladder a little ways so we can tie a rope at the end of it so we can drag it over, being led by the cable, being dragged over and landed on the roof. [This is the scaffolding for the curtain wall...] Curtain wall. Right. So I took one step down the ladder and for some reason, those big heavy duty aluminum ladders. Another contractor had it out there and I checked it. It was wired off. Everything was proper. I knew it was a heavy duty. You could see the beefier ones. I took the second step down and right down toward the base, it snapped. Down I come. About three floors and landed on concrete. I landed feet first, broke the right ankle. Then I did a slam on the right side, broke my collar bone. Knocked the wind out of me again, of course. And two ribs in my back and my left arm. That was my demise right there. I laid in the hospital because when my agent stopped, I had a blood clot problems. My calves and    my legs were cramping up and all kinds of different things going on. I just couldn’t manage it. They sent me to the warm water pool... I spent three and a half months in a wheel chair. Then I was on crutches. Then I got one of those walkers. I still got the walker, it’s kind of neat. I came out of it pretty much. A little limp here and there, some aches and pains of course. Its...that was it. I’m done. Just a few months later I was 60 years old. Enough was enough. WIFE: It took months to recover. Eeegor: They sent me to the warm water pool over in Harbor [Athletics] in Middleton and I kind of enjoyed that. I’d go from...right now, I go over there and with the aches and stuff. You see a lot of people in the same condition, the same age. It’s a tough trade. I know a lot of people that fall and you don’t see them again. That’s it. They’re gone. Either that, they get so crippled up, and they’re a lot younger than I am. I’m surprised... There are a lot of guys that get the hell out after 40 years, 45 years or something like that. They get that wound and they’re not able to get around as well. Yeah, it’s a tough trade, there’s no getting around it.  46:48 [Could you say something about the weather conditions under which you worked?] Working on American Family. OSHA says every third floor has to be decked solid so people can’t fall over three floors because people can survive when they fall three floors. Four floors, five, six, nine floors, it’s not like years ago. It’d be 9 floors and so what, 10-20 floors, but every third floor... So they decked it in the middle of winter. So here comes this big snow storm. 12-14-18 inches snow. Then the sun comes out and thaws, freezes, thaws, freezes, thaws.  Comes down all the other floors. Solid ice. And this happens from time to time and we’ve got to go... Me and my partner have to put cables on and different things. Clean this stuff off so you can put the decking down in between the other floors. It gets a little hairy at times. I’ve seen situations where... When they were working on Madison General then, now it’s Meriter... We’d clean off the iron the best we could but what are you going to do if you get a rain storm and stuff, and it freezes on. Different things like that. I went on my keister more than once. Luckily it was only a floor, sliding around, trying to get a day’s work in. You’d bang... You go ahead of yourself and bang in the iron so you can work. It can get pretty hairy at times. Especially iron. That’s why I kind of like working on the re-rods in the winter because you’re down in the hole, where you’re out of the wind. Or you’re in a more level plain. Your work is right in front of you. It’s not as slippery or stuff like this. And there’s times where you just can’t work. The guys... You got to just clean it up. It can be too damn hazardous for people would be out on it. But  they don’t ever want to shut it down anymore. These guys are... “No, we’ve got a job to do here. Things got to be done.”  49:04 [When your dad was working, you said it was 9 months. So was it winter when they shut down?] I don’t think they could pour the concrete back then. You didn’t have the additives in  the concrete. The stuff they put in it. So there were time periods where he’d be off and take unemployment. Either that or get the heck out of the area and go further south or make a few phone calls. A lot of times you could check the union hall and they’ll call... They’ll call the union halls to see if there was any work or what kind of work it is. They’ll say, well, we’ll need a  couple structural guys here. They’re talking high flyers too. Either that or rebars or something like that. Guys would get their names in and drive on down. Pack a suitcase and there you’re gone for a few months. That’s the trouble with this type of work. You have to go where the work is. You’re gone sometimes a week or two. A project that we worked on down in North Carolina. I had to be gone a couple of weeks at a time. It was a pretty good deal. It was warmer    down there than it was up here in the winter. I left her alone. She had to take care of the driveway. She either hired someone or managed it, stuff like that. But it’s still stressful.  50:35 [You talked before about how re-enforcing had to be added to structural... Was there a status differentiation between one or another of those? Little rivalries? ] Oh yeah. There’s competition there. A lot of guys that work structural, they won’t work rods. “I don’t do that. I’m better than that.” They see the rods are grunt work you might say. It’s the laborers compared to a brick layer. You know? “You can bring my material up and everything like this but... Don’t bother me with all these incidentals. I’m a structural man.” Yeah, there’s an arrogance there, there always has been. I enjoyed all of it. It didn’t bother me one way or another. It pays the same. Some locals it isn’t. Some locals are mixed. Those that aren’t mixed, there’s structural... Like Local 1. You’ve got your ornamental. But I think they’re mixed now, whereas the scale is probably the same in some cases. I don’t know. I got that book here that tells you all the scales on it. New York is the place to be if you like high rises though.  51:58 [With some of these different parts of the trade, are there little terms or nicknames used if you’re tying re-bars versus connecting?] You mean a Rodney Re-bar. [What’s that?] You call a guy Rodney Re-bar. LAUGHS Yeah, here comes Rodney. LAUGHS [Rod buster?] Yeah, rod buster is pretty common. [What does that mean?] Pretty much typical what you call them. Well, he’s a rod buster. That’s his forte. That’s what he does. Yeah, he’s an old rod buster. [I think Ryan Roth, whenI asked him if he was a rod buster... And he said “We’re rod busters and sod busters.”] Yeah...  53:00 [You used the term high flyer. Is that...?] Some of these guys are high flyers. I mean...these guys who loved to get up on the structural and get around pretty good. There’s no getting around there. Yeah, well, he’s a high roller. Just like a high roller. LAUGHS [A gambling man.] Yeah, you’re gambling up there, I tell ya. You’re being influenced by other material coming in, and cables and weather and wind. But you know, like I was talking to the guys yesterday in the hall. He said, “You know, they don’t even permit these guys to walk around iron any more. They’ve got cables stretched across so you have something to hang on to.” You never seen that years ago. They’d send the material up and a keg of bolts and there you go. Sit on the iron over there, reach over there and grab your stuff. I’ve got pictures of a lot of that business. It got hairy. And the thing is, you’ve always got to be looking above you. A lot of guys, they drop materials and stuff on you. You hear things clanging down from several floors, you kind of want to climb right into your hard hat, you know? [Did you ever get hit?] Oh yeah, I got stuff ricocheted off my shoulder and stuff. One time I had a 3 quarter ratchet come down and hit me in the back. Put a big gouge in my back. Stuff falling on you all the time. It’s just...  54:44 And these people...years ago. A lot of guys never wore hard hats, a lot of them. A friend of mine that I’ve worked with – it was before the time of hard hats. He was working at Royster’s on the east side. It was a big fertilizer plant. He said, yeah, they had some iron come up. He didn’t have it hooked right. You might say it shit out of the device they had it in. He had an old army fatigue hat with the brim up. He said the thing came down, knocked the brim down on my hat. That’s how close it came. LAUGHTER He never forgot that. It was like.... Whoa...  Some cases, the hard hats don’t really get it either.    55:42 [Is there anything distinctive about the ironworkers hard hat?] There was a variety of... There are saucer hats. Now they’re pretty much standard with the... They have it around tight and they have the brim in the front. I got a couple of them out in the garage. My dad used to wear the type what they called the saucer hat. [I’d like to photograph some] I have more of this stuff. I eat this up. It’s great that someone does that. There’s a lot of history and a lot of people...to see and do things like this. It gives you a great feeling to see this. [I sure am enjoying this.]  BREAK  56:50 [Could you tell me a little bit about how you got your tools for the trade.] There were places that were recommended. You’d go up to a particular wholesaler because they were a different type of tool, the spud wrenches and stuff. You’d go to this facility... I forget. It’s been so many years. You never see anybody else carrying that type of stuff. Yeah. They recommend... [This was in Madison?] Oh yes, the east side of Madison on Williamson Street. This one place had everything you needed. Some of the basic...like crescent wrenches and stuff like that. It’s no big deal. Big beaters you get at Farm and Fleet or these other facilities and stuff. Welding hoods and stuff. There’s a safety facility, South Safety Equipment, and stuff where I used to get gloves and different things. Just any kind of safety equipment you wanted. But a lot of contractors supply some of this. But your belts and different things like that. Sometimes you’d have to go to a shoe shop. And they would make...in their advertisement, they’d say, “Hardest making” and stuff for horses and different things. You would go and tell them what you wanted, what type of belt and stuff and they’d lay it all out for you. Get the slings and different things over your shoulders if that’s what you wanted. I had one for re-rods and when you’re tying walls. You’re going up the wall and you have a hook that you... And you had a little wide belt in the back that you slip on over your other belt. The original belt would be that thick but you’d have a canvas thing about this wide that you would snap behind that because you’d be resting back into it. You might be 30 feet up on a reinforced wall, and you’d be tying there, hanging all day. Stepping in... You go up and snap on...go on up...keep going...stuff like this, all the way up.  59:10 [Were they custom belt makers...] Pretty much. They had them out there if you look around. Try them on and different things. But they had to be somewhat of a heavy duty belt, safety belt and stuff. They got more and more fussy over the years. Some of the belts were not of quality until people started getting hurt. Then they started looking into it and some contractors supply what you needed. But you’re pretty much on your own in that respect. [This shoe maker, do you remember who that was and where?] No. It’s been too many years ago. It was over on the northeast side. It was recommended by a friend of ours and he went in there. He had harness making, shoe repair, and stuff. I’ll look into it and sure enough, he had what I wanted. He had some of it pre-made already. Other people had come in there and asked for that same style of stuff. Some guys did it for themselves. Some were pretty good at it. [Do you know someone who would do it now?] No. But I know they had done it, talked about it and stuff. [This would have been early 60s or something like that?] Actually middle, early 60s. 61, 62, 63, somewhere in there. It was pretty much standard just to have a belt on. But when you have a belt on, you’d have two spuds on one side of course. Then you’d have a beater. They made a harness with a little snap for it. You can just drop a beater in. The hard part of the beater would be up and the    handle would be sticking down. It had a 12 inch crescent which is proper. Then you have a tape measure. You have a bolt bag and tool. A lot of companies what you to have two bolt bags.  And then they want you to fill both of them up. You might... These are 3⁄4 inch bolts and you’re talking 35-40-45 pounds on you. Then you’re expected to go up a column. You’re carrying your bronze body and all that stuff, although they don’t do that much any more. I could manage three floors and that was about it. [You could climb...] Vertical. Three floors. [Could you tell me your technique for doing that?] It all depends on the shape of the columns, the configuration of the column. In some cases, you would put your feet ahead of you, if it was deep. You grab on with your hands... And back and forth, up...all the way up. If it was a different configuration, a shorter one, you would grab on the back side of both flanges, and then you’d put your knees crossed and work your way on up. It would be an interesting experience. And then when you slide down, you have to watch out. When they built columns sometimes, it would go straight up and then it would step in because it’s less weight. Then it would go up to another level. Okay. When you slide down, the inside of your knees would hit these little out-croppings. It would make tears come to your eyes. GIGGLE But... You... But once you get up on the level, you are there for a couple of hours so you had plenty of chance to rest and stuff. Then you’d go to the next level, hooking up the iron. A lot of times they would snap a bag on the hook and bring it up to you. Then you wouldn’t have to go all the way down for bolts or anything like that. They would bring material up to you, once you got on the level that you were working, depending on how big a floor it is. How much iron is there. A lot of times you spend half a day on one level. Then you only have to climb one floor to the next level and go from there. And between time, you get to sit and wait for the next piece to come up. Smoke a cigarette or whatever. Tell them to hurry up or whatever.  01:03:30 [Did you ever have a rope...or did you use your notch to haul stuff up levels?] No usually the stuff is way too big. You can manage... [Just a bag of bolts or something.] Yeah, something like that. They’d pull some up. On a lot of the iron they’d send up... The ground guy would have a rope around one end, a tag line, so he could steer the iron to the proper end to that particular person. And then the rig would swing the iron to the other guy. He would just cut the rope loose. Or he would keep it on there in case he needed some material, like more bolts or something in the bag that you have down on the ground. Follow through that way.  01:04:20 If I can make a comment. It’s funny kind of. This one guy. He was one of the best connectors I had ever seen. But he was a feisty SOB. His name was Norm Lenzer. Pat [his wife], she’s met him... He was a hard drinking, carrying on kind of guy. Anyway, they were working at Oscar Mayer’s, putting an addition on the hog kill. They had brought the iron up,  with a tag line on one end, the steered around to where he could...hook it up. They couldn’t make that thing fit worth a damn. The first thing he did was a mistake... He pulled the rope off and let it drop to the ground, which is probably 6-7 floors. Anyways, my dad was pushing the job. He was down on the ground. Norm, not thinking, “God damnit, I need a beater. Son of a bitch, it ain’t gonna work.” He says, “Well, you know you had a hand line up there and you dumb son of a bitch, if you would have hung on to it, you would have had a beater coming up to you.” Just like that, Lenzer was down on the ground, skimming all the way down, looking for my old man. The old man disappeared. GIGGLES He wasn’t going to hang around after laying into  him like that because he was going to knock him on his ass. Anyways... He tells me about it    about 3-4 weeks later. “Ya know, the old man just disappeared. I don’t know where the hell he went.” And he just laughs about it. This is a constant thing. Especially with this guy. He was a character. [Well, tell me more about him.] He isn’t in the best of shape. The last thing I heard about him, I think he lives up in DeForest. He quit probably in his 50s. He went into bridge inspecting for the state. Then he got hurt so he couldn’t do that any more. He’s probably around 73-75. But he’s got the things in his nose and he has to carry around oxygen because he was a heavy smoker. He was a heavy drinker...heavy on everything. I think he was on his third wife. LAUGHTER [Good connector though.] Oh yeah. I tell ya what. I can show you a picture of a project we were on. If you can get up 9 floors and stand broadside on a 4 inch beam and yell down to the ground crew and say “Where the hell is all the iron?” Bitch about something up there. You’re standing on something that’s 4 inches wide. It takes... In references to that, it takes balls the size of grapefruits. LAUGHS Here’s one picture... Here’s another one. That iron wasn’t that big. [Wow..yeah...four inches?] Yeah, that top stuff is pretty narrow. These guys... That’s what you wanted to see right there. [Oh, okay. Ev shows a rodbuster decal which Leary photographs]. Here, do you want it? Go ahead. [Way cool.]  01:08:24 [You did re-bar for a long time. Was there kind of an art to that?] Oh yeah. There is a lot to it. There are a lot of different ties. A saddle tie, criss-cross tie. Snap tie. Vertical tie. Yeah, there’s a whole book on it. We drug these guys through an apprenticeship program when I was on the board. We would have to test these guys to make sure they know it and then you ended up giving it a rock and then spin it. Then tighten it up because you don’t want nothing loose. The larger the rods, you have to use double wire. I was pretty good at it. It is an art.  You can really buzz through it. Get a lot of that stuff done in a hurry. Some people kind of drag along, and they won’t be around very long. The supervisor would have to get rid of that SOB. But I kind of liked it myself, especially on the wire. It’s too damn cold sitting up there 8-9-10 floors up. That’s enough of that business. And the work is more consistent, f you’re not afraid if you have to bend over all day long on some of them slabs, but some of it is vertical. A lot of the jobs where you’ve got to make up the columns in between the floors. You’re on the ground and what they do is set up two saw horses. You’ve got 4, 6, 8, 20 barbed columns maybe 20 feet long. You get up all these little circular parts in to separate the rods. They call them bands. You’d have some configurations would have to be this wide and stuff life this. Then the rig would come over and pick it up, stand it on end, and that would be your separation from one floor to the next. They pour all that in and they’d have... When they come to the mid-floor, they would come up and have a 90 degree turn. And that 90 degree turn would embed into the floor above. So that’s how they continue on. It all locks together.  01:10:44 [When you’re tying that rebar to your... It’s not a solo thing, you’re part of a team or people...who are setting them on saddles or something...?] Oh yeah. There are a pair of guys working here and a pair of guys working there. There might be 3-4 guys working on a wall because as you bring the material in, there would be three or four of them that would probably put it on their arms and then they climb up, and then put it on the wall and snap it with one hand. The other guy is holding it place and stuff. It depends on who’s the approacher on it. There are a lot of different... In some cases, what they’ll do is take the whole works and it would be three times the size of this room. They would make it on the ground and put all their ties in and all that.  Then they’ll bring in what they call an evener bar. It’s a beam with hooks in a variety of distances    on the outside. What they’ll do is have the rig’ll swing over and with the evener bar, they’ll pick up the top of it up over here and bring it up like this, carry it over and laid it against the wall and set it down. Tie it all in place. It works neater than hell. That way it’s a lot easier for everybody because then its all at your feet. You know? They work layer after layer sometimes and do it that way. So it’s a different approach. Everyone’s got a little different approach on it. And it depends on how all those configurations. If it’s a 90 degree turn here, there and stuff. Things... There can be a variety of different approaches.  01:12:26 [So did you ever work with some guys who were really good to work with and also that weren’t too...?] You’ll get that, you know? I know that job with Helga Steel. We had a nucleus of guys and we pretty much traveled together. We got along great. Whereas with Kupfer’s sometimes, some of these guys... There’s more politics going on there. You get politics just like in anything. Some guys would get most of the lion share of the... If there was overtime coming up, you knew who was going to get it. I might get one Saturday a year. And you got a young family and stuff you want to take care of. And some of these guys would get it a dozen or 14 times. You know? And you’re hungry. But there would be animosity and some guys would say, “Oh take your job and put it where the sun don’t shine.” He’d move on to another contractor. You hear that all the time. Some guys like to burn their bridges. I never did but that wasn’t the smart thing to do. GIGGLE Work gets slack. You start burning your bridges, you’re in a world of hurt unless you’re really good at what you do. But then they got an ego trip and some of these guys have an ego the size of a Mack truck. GIGGLE Let me see if I can find this. PAUSE  01:14:00 [Let me ask a couple more questions. Topping out ceremonies? Do you ever get involved in any of the customs in the trade?] Oh yeah. I was working in Milwaukee, on a new federal building down town. They finally... We put the last final piece of these tubes together, tying two buildings together. Then we were working on the hand railings. Kenny Kruska was the main guy from Findorff and he brought a group of people in from the local guys down there and they all...contractors and stuff... You all sit down in the middle in this atrium and what we did... We made a platform like what you see, what they’re standing on. A pick. It’s what you call a pick, what you stand on...when you’re on these platforms. We made a pick set up and then we had four ropes come out of it, put clove hinges on each end and then put... I forget the name of the knot...up on the top. Then they picked it up a little bit. They had a Christmas tree on one  end and a flag on the other end. That’s the ceremony. And then the overhead tower crane picked it up real slow. These guys are snapping pictures and stuff. We backed off... They were saying... One of the supervisors down there said, “Tell them guys to get the hell out of there. They’ve done their job.” LAUGHS So we had to scatter. We felt used and abused at times. [They used a rope and not chokers and steel cables.] Yeah, to be a little more...trouble, you know. What was handy. It worked. They send it up and all they did was send it up and they swung it over the 12th floor and set it up on the deck up there. It would sit there for a day and then they’d tear it all apart. And that was the end of that business.  01:16:15 I CAN tell you a story about working on that project. They had a tower crane come up in the middle of one of the stacks. They had two tower cranes on there. One level was this and one level was that. Well, they were getting closer on this one than they were on this one    because the square footage is larger over here. So the smaller square footage, they were catching up. One day, they come around, the guy wasn’t watching, and they had these two ... BAM ... come together. And here it is... It’s right at the top. One supervisor asked me, “Do you want to climb out there and see...? They’re not sure if there’s any damage up there. See if there’s a bunch of fissure cracks” and stuff like that. And I’m thinking...No, you can do it. LAUGHTER I ain’t going to go up there. If you want to be some here, you go for it. GIGGLES They eventually had to tear it up, nothing ever came of it. I remember... One tower crane that took care of the larger area, they’re about in the 10-11th floor. They had to put another section in...or two. What they do is... This thing has a big ram in here. Inside there’s a sleeve. The rubbers were shot on it. So the ram would come up and then it would just die right back because the hydraulics wouldn’t hold because the gaskets were gone. So we had to climb up there and beat the ladder all the way up because there was ice all over everything. They brought the tower crane in, the hook, and we disconnected both of them. Then they took it down to the street and took it to some manufacturing place, tore it all apart and got it back together and brought it back in. GIGGLE They put it back in place. What they do is... This thing would come up like this and it would extend itself. Three sides of this tower crane would raise up. It would go out to the street and pick up another section and come in, and drop it on the existing tower. Then this thing would let down on it. That’s how they done it. There’s so many different ways they can do it. When they come to take it apart, they had the biggest one...in Hennes ??? rig. They brought it up around this alley next to the parking ramp. They boomed it up and the guy couldn’t. You gotta boom it up and then you got a jib on the end of it. It gives it a little more reach. It’s like this. You can see the jib so it doesn’t carry as much. So they got the big block here and a small block there. So he’s up over the deck where he can’t see from the ground. He steps up on the rig and he forgot that he had tripped on the levers on the thing. The extended part, the big ball that pulls the cable down, that’s the big headache, they call it because that’s what’ll happen if it hits you. LAUGHS And these things go 300-400-500 pounds. What happened was... This thing come up and sucked this thing right up and back, and buckled it right to the cab. LAUGHS He was beside himself. They brought it back down and they got the extra stops on each side. It’s going to come down. It’s happened where they come right back, snapped off, and then run right back into the cab where the guy is sitting. That can be a little hairy.  01:20:03 What happened down in 9 Springs... The guy is working the clam bucket. Do you know what I mean by a clam bucket? You can see the big bucket where the scoop the mud, bring it over and put it in the thing. They were taking a lot of that stuff out of the sewage plant over there. There’s all these PCBs or whatever it is. All that pollution. It’s part of that super fund. They were cleaning that all up. He’s got the base of these things...both sides of your boom sticking up. There’s a huge pin that comes across here. This thing has a lot of wear and tear on it. So he swings over and boom down and the clam would pick itself up. This boom would come back like this. He brought it back like this and the thing snapped across like this and the thing twisted. That happened a couple of times where we had a boom come right down and land on the iron, snap the... On that job in Hartford...they had a rig in there that was able to pick up... It’s limit was 10 ton. And they had a big box truck that went over a gym. Box truck means it has four sides like a box. It had a...it goes like that. It goes the whole length of the gym and everyone ties off of that. Everybody... They had cables already on it and stuff. So once they get up there, they can cable it off so the wind doesn’t take it. The boom was right up tight. If you’re    going to lift a lot of weight, you got to be right up close. He got up there, set it there, and everyone kind of wiped their brow and the boss is stressed. “Oh, you got everything? Okay. Fine. Hook it up. That’s great.” Here it is the next day... I’m walking by the rig. I hear a whomp... The damn hydraulic line broke on the rig and the headache come down and missed me by about four feet. If that happened a day earlier, it would have taken out about four people. Its that kind of thing that is progressively happening. You can laugh about it afterwards but it’s not... It gives you... The old timers would always tell you... When you’re working with a rig, stand between the rig and the load because then you have a chance. If it’s going over, it’s going to go out. So if you’re out there, you’ll have a chance to get out from under it. One thing about cables and stuff like that. You can hear a whooooooooosh...like that. That’s when the cables are unwinding. And the drag line... They’ll come out... You take a cable out and when you’re setting stone, you set it from 2 points. They come in a truck, come in like this or this. They’ll pick it up with one and then pick it up with another. How they do that... They’ve got the jib line come down and they’ll pick it up here... And they have a line coming from the center of the rig right at the base of the cab. They’ll come up and pick it up here. This line will pick it up to a point and this one will hold it to keep it from skipping off the thing. That way they can bring it up, cut it loose, and bring the piece up and set it in place.  01:23:40 But we were working on the Anchor Savings and Loan on the corner of the Square. He had a piece that he picked up off the truck. It didn’t quite make it clear of the truck and it broke loose. Thump...on the ground. And we were waiting up there to set it. You don’t stand under things either. You always keep an eye out for stuff like that. You got to have eyes in the back of your head sometimes. There are people who get hurt too, who don’t realize when they’re young... A lot of guys don’t think about it until you see something happen...and then you say shoulda coulda woulda whatever. It’s a little late then.  01:24:30 Yeah, that Norm Lenzer, he was a character. Fist fighting SOB. [Was he a big guy?] 6’ 2” something like that. Kind of long and lean. He was in the Marine Corps and was out on some kind of expedition or something...just in training. A jeep went over his arm so he was not able to stay in the service. He got out of there. He had one arm that was a little crooked but it still had the strength there. So he got into the trades. Yeah. He was... We used to get a kick out of him. He had guts like you wouldn’t believe. There are very few people who could keep up...you know, climbing the columns and getting around. But few of those guys used to work out at Turner Hall. It used to be a work out place. Gymnists and stuff like that. They were getting pretty good at it. They kept themselves in really good shape. But then they drank just as hard as they worked, belligerent bunch of people sometimes. But they would help hold together in a group.  01:25:50 Years ago, they used to travel around in what they called a gang. It was a small group of guys and my Dad was part of a riveting gang. They’d travel from here and there and they would work... Like I mentioned before, he worked on the State Street Bridge in Chicago. It’s one of those things he can remember. They built scaffolds up and platforms that they can work off and used riveting gangs. They would throw a few bolts on the thing to connect it and they’d get up there on that. You see that on a lot of railroad track bridges where they have a lot of vibration and stuff. In some jobs, they did it years ago. Then they went to what they call dartlets,    I think it was dartlets. It had the round head on it. Oh look at here. We have a visitor. A big ol’ chunk of lead. Is that your dog? LAUGHTER Yeah, they... I’m trying to think of the ones we used at American Family. There was a... They had a funny head on them, the nut head. You’d put the bolt in and tighten it up, just snug it up. Then you put this electric wrench on it. Then when that rattled up, this very thing on the end... You knew you had the proper torque when it would snap this end off. I think it was called a “luck bolt.” I think that’s what they call it. Then you knew you had a proper torque on the damn thing. Years ago you had to adjust the tork ?? when your cranking on bolts, rattling them up. And then you’d have a guy who would follow through. Sometimes an engineer would follow through and check periodically with a tork wrench to make sure you had enough on it.  01:27:49 I had an experience in one of the first times I supervised a job. It was on the Worzine [sp?] Engineering Building over on the Medical—it’s out Mineral Point Road. I think Gammon Road comes across. Not quite Gammon. Back in there. It looks like a concrete building. What it was... It was an L-shaped or a T-shaped building and all of a sudden I’m there supervising the job. The first thing, a guy came out of the trailer, the superintendent. He said, “Well, some of the anchor bolts...” They already had one floor in at ground level because there was a basement in it. We had a row of beams in there. So we had to start along the parameter. Every one of them bolt settings were off. And they are 4 3⁄4 inch bolts and they’re off an inch this way and a half inch to 3⁄4 inch the other way. That was the whole wing. So we have to tip over the columns and cut all the new holes in them. Then we’d tip them back up. An engineer says to me, “We got to put washers on that. You can’t just put a big 3⁄4 nut on that. This thing is going to tip over.” So okay. We got a bunch of washers and got that all settled. We come to that T-part, and the superintendent says, “Oh, by the way, what I told you the measurements were? That ain’t right.” So we had to lay out a whole new set of holes. And then when we go to set the stuff, they were squared tubes, like that. Six by six or something like that. The night connections that came out were at the wrong level. So we had to cut them off and re-weld them at a different level. LAUGHS It was one thing after another. They had a supervisor that was just....ARGH The exterior work was all pre-cast concrete. We had to tie the rods in a box, you might say, and some of them were pretty big. 20-25 feet long and 10 feet high or whatever. We would tie all the reinforcing in there and then they poured the concrete in it. After the concrete would set up, they would pick the stone up and set them on horses to dry. Then the guy would come along and sandblast them. There would sort of be a rough edge on it. We go to set some of these things...some of them are over 10-12 ton. LAUGHS We’d swing over and set it up and it would sit on two little bitty lugs. It’s surprising. But this engineer, you see this guy doing the welding, he’s certified and he’s been tested. The guy looked over his shoulder and said, “I don’t want him weld any more.” So I had to do the welding. I was the only other certified guy there. So you set up and get things tacked in place.  01:31:10 On this one big piece, we had to set... We set it up on there and I should have had another part in line. It had two parts in it. One part come down...you should have had another part in the damn thing because they set it up there... He set it up there and he couldn’t hold it in place and the thing kept pulling down. The brakes wouldn’t hold it because it was too heavy. So he set it up there, finally got it up in place. Set it on the lugs. It was interesting. These big pieces of concrete, when you set them on these horses, they were 6-8 ton and all of a sudden... Their    horses were kind of old. Three or four of them just went...THUMP THUMP THUMP THUMP And you just don’t slow them down. And they had to start all over again. [A nightmare job.] It was interesting. Did you ever see any cowbirds? [Yeah, I used to see them all the time.] See the one out there? We had some red birds coming in here.  [Is there anything you’d like to add...?] I’ll think of something once you leave. That’s what always happens. [Well, we have an hour and a half...]  PART TWO OF THE INTERVIEW  [I’m back again because I’ve got to hear that story about the stockyards you just told me.] Okay. While working on, I think it was Stoppenbach’s, we were putting that three story addition on the back side next to the kill floor in the stockyard pen. It come break time. An easy way of getting down instead of flying down a column was to jump on the headache ball. I jumped on the headache ball and he swung me out over the side. I think this was a little joke on them, is the fact that he, he swung me right over and dropped me down in front of a big old bull. And there was no place to go. I didn’t know what to do. He’s laughing so hard that he pretty near fell out of the rig. And the rest of them are just a-cackling. And eventually, it come to the point to well, ok, it’s over with. He lifted me up and brought me down on the outside of the fence. But, oh, funny! [So where was that now?] I think it was in Fort Atkinson and it was for an addition on the backside of the stockyard. It was either Stoppenbach’s or Jones Diary. Jones Dairy, I think is in Jefferson. But this was in Fort Atkinson. Stoppenbach’s... I don’t even know if they’re still around. [Cool...great...]
Ironworkers;Harold “Pork” Clausen;0:09 trade?  0:45  my life. I was born in 1941, April 26th. And I was a laborer for a couple, three years, and I got a chance to get in with the ironworkers. And I got in there, and I got my book in September 9th, 1963.  Topic  Announcement, initial question–when and where born, how you got into ironworkers  I was born in Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin, 15 miles south of here. And I’ve lived here all  1:18 [Why change from ironworker to laborer?] Well, there was better money in it and it seemed like the guys were rough and tough and liked to get right at ‘er and go for it. So I done my apprenticeship in Madison, Wisconsin. I worked with some of the boys and they put me right to the test right away. Nine stories high and we were at the Jefferson [WI], the Ladish Malt House which, at the time, was the largest malt house in the world. We were demolition. They would throw me over the side with a cutting torch and down through all the duct work, starting from the top and go down. Just start stripping her out. And the guys kind of got...favored me a little bit so I think I got in quicker than normal because I was running with the boys. Keeping up with them. [You have to lift your leg a little higher when you’re running around with the big dogs. LAUGHS] Yeah, and I go my book and they started a nuclear reactor in Genoa, Wisconsin. I got to be closer to home to work. 26 miles. But from then on, after that job was complete, I’ve been everywhere. Half of the United States and all over. Lived out of a suitcase. Saw my wife now and then and my family. The jobs are so interesting that every job is different. You just don’t know what you’re going to get into. I just love it. It’s all outdoors. You deal with Mother Nature all the time.  3:12 [Who were some of these older guys you started out with in Madison. Can you tell me a little bit about those characters?] Well, at that time, Orla Coleman was our business agent. He was a rough and toughie, big time. He had a brother who lived in Gays Mills, Wisconsin, Vic Coleman, he’s deceased now. Neil Kane, he lives in La Crosse. He was born and raised a few miles from me. He was the one that got me started in the whole show. Took me under his arm. I lost my Dad when I was eleven and Neil, he kind of took me under his arms. He has a brother-in-law at Harper’s Ferry, which is an ironworker, Harland Luster. He’s passed on. And we traveled quite a bit around together. Every time we went to another job, they’d make me foreman. Keep me to the test. I’ve been a foreman pretty much all my life. You meet a lot of different people and you’ve got to do the hard against them. There are two sayings about this job. You can’t make it, you can’t stay. And... It’s up the stack or down the track. That’s the way it went. And if you walked on the job and you were going to sign up to go to work, and if you pull a pipe out of your pocket, they’d just tell you, “Just put that pipe back in your pocket because you ain’t got time to smoke it.” That’s how it... You just run and gun with the boys all the time. There really was no OSHA, no safety equipment nor nothing. You just rolled with the punches.  5:12 [Tell me a little more about Neil, as a guy and as an ironworker.] Neil was a rough and tough. He still is to this day. He’s 83, 84. SHARON CLAUSEN: He still stops in to see us. PORK: Yeah, and he was rough and tough. I got to run with him a lot. There was no BSing about nothing. When you come out there, you were straight to the punch and got with the program. [When you started in Madison in your apprenticeship, did you stay somewhere like a boarding house or...?] Yeah, you just stayed in any motel or shack or anything you could find. We worked in the... I ran on the road for 8-10 years with L.G. Arnold, a bridge outfit. When we left, we were up by Black River Falls or somewhere. We were paid on Tuesdays but Tuesday... Monday night, they sent me to Portage, Wisconsin, on a bridge job. I got down there and I had no clothes or nothing, just what I wore to get down there. It was closer to come that direction than to come home. So I went down there and figured I would get my check tomorrow. Well, the check never came. I had $10 on me and nowhere to stay. The motel room was 20 bucks. I called around town and there was an old hotel downtown in Portage, about 10-12 stories high. They had a room left for $7. I boogied right down there. It was upstairs in the attic. You walked in up there, they took me up. You couldn’t hardly get through the door. It was just a little bunk bed and 25 watt light bulb with a string hanging down. And I was whipped so I just laid down, pulled the cord and shut the light off. It wasn’t too seconds and a big rat jumped right on my chest. LAUGHTER Yeah, I left the light on anyway and got my sleep. Well, the checks came the next day so I got me a nice room in the motel the next night. And that night, the whole motel burnt down to the ground. So I figured I got lucky on that one. I could talk forever with so many different stories.  7:48 [You mentioned when you started out in Madison on that apprenticeship, you got kind of a baptism of fire... What was it you were doing, welding...?] We had a cutting torch. We would demo, cut all the duct work off along the side of the building. That same job, the grain dust down there, they burned the sulfur and all that. You had to run through those rooms to get to your next project with a hanky over your face because you couldn’t see or nothing. There were walls you just run through. But we were demolition down in the bottom of that building. That grain dust is like explosive, like gun powder. We got to the end of that building and all that stuff was working ahead of us. Eventually it went off in one big flash fire, singed your eyebrows and stuff. It’s all over in half a second. We got over to the Lansing Powerhouse. I started over there... I was the longest man on the job, even the laborers. I was there four years and ten months. They built the powerhouse. That’s when they were building the hole and I connected on it and we put in the rebar there first and connect. When that was done, I had detail work in the building. We put all the catwalks in and the grating in the elevators and all that. That place blew up twice. Lucky to get out of that one. The feeder pipe--they were trying to run the whole plant and it wasn’t ready yet. They didn’t have the communications, the computers hooked up. They were running it manually. The operations would run in their control rooms and they started turning the dials. Pretty soon them big boiler pipes would get cherry red all the way to the top. Then they’d release and blow. That happened twice. And as it was running, the coal dust, everything was leaking. Once one of them would blew, the people were outside and they would see fire going out of them windows about 20 feet all the way around. Whop. It’s over. Just a flash fire. Before they would blow, that building would start shaking so bad. All that coal dust would come down black like smog. That’s what ignited and blew. See. That happened twice. We never lost anyone on that job. [Where was that?] In Lansing, Iowa, just across the river. I even went to work by boat, but every time I took my boat to work, I get off work and there would be a big storm. I could run up there in a boat quicker than I could drive around, so I just quit taking the boat.  10:57 [Are there many guys along this river who are ironworkers or in the trade?] Well, the closest now would be La Crosse, which is forty miles from here. SHARON CLAUSEN: Stoddard. PORK: Yeah, Stoddard. I’ve got some buddies up there. There ain’t too many left. Not too many left. My neighbor’s kid, I gave him my tools and he took the apprenticeship program. He’s an ironworker now. Tommy Lawrence. I don’t see him much either.  11:35 [So how did you get your tools?] You just bought ‘em. Most old timers had the hand-me-downs. They’d just give you their tools. When you wanted something decent, you went and bought new. ‘Cause hey do wear out. [Did you get any hand-me-downs from people?] Oh yes, I got spud wrenches that fit 2 1⁄2 inch bolts. They’re longer than your leg, they drag on the ground. They’re collectables now. [Did any guys mark their tools or modify them?] Oh yeah, we’d put a little weld initial on them or something. And then there was times...we never had a coffee break. When you went to work, you went to work. When the bell rang at noon, you slid down off the iron. You ate your lunch. But normally when you’re up connecting, you packed your lunch with you. You didn’t’ have time to go down to eat and get back up. So you just carried your lunch in a five gallon bucket, to relieve yourself. [Would you use knots to pull them up? Do you carry all that stuff on your belt? Or would you just haul up some stuff?] We’d haul up our dinner buckets with ropes and stuff. But you’d carry your belt right on you. Your average belt would weigh, then, while you had your spud, your sleever bar and your 8 pound maul on you...and couple of bolt bags full of bolts. You average 32-35 pounds that you had around your waist all day long. You was sore every night when you got off work. You didn’t have any trouble sleeping. You’d go to the pub right away and get a few quick ones in you. Eat a pail full, lay down and die. That’s what you did. And head out the next morning.  13:43 [Did you climb columns?] Yeah. You didn’t get in the lift. We just jumped on the headache ball and zoomed up. But what I liked--this time here, when there’s a fog in the morning--we had radios. They had... Because the fog and stuff was so thick, and you’d never see the ground until like 11 in the morning. You’d look up and here comes a chunk of iron up. Then you’d talk to the operator about where to swing over and make it. About 11 o’clock, the fog would lift. Then you’d see all your buddies down there working. [Is that along the river?] Yeah, up in Genoa, that job.  14:21 [Tell me about that job, at Genoa. What you did there and what you worked on. Any incidents that happened...] Well, Genoa, that was the first reactor in the state of Wisconsin. They never really fired up over 15%. When the reactor come in, it weighed 96 ton and it come in by rail. We never had no equipment to pick it with or nothing. They had the dome... The boilermakers built the vessel and its 140 foot high. There was a 150 ton overhead crane up there but that wasn’t completed. Because later we had to line it with rebar and concrete all the way up to the top. There was a circular rail where the crane went around. He helped with the rigging. Let me get back to that reactor when it come in on rail. And all we had for rigging was two 25 ton chain falls. Two 20 ton chain falls, and two 16 ton chain falls. We worked composite with the boilermakers because it was...we worked together. The rail went right straight in to the side of the building. The reactor...and there was two buildings on each side. There was a light pole and it brought in a low boy to set that on. We had to transfer it all the way around the building and put it in a temporary hole in the side of the vessel. I myself was stumped... How are we going to get the low boy in there? It’s a 90 degree turn. We had it hanging off the rail. They pulled the rail car out, hanging there. Here come the low boy and they had a bulldozer there, a big cat. He got on the side of that. He was up in the track and he started pushing the back end of that low boy, sideways. He’d back again, push it on, push it... He got it right over there and it was right over on the tracks. Just everything beautiful. Now we unloaded it, set it on the low boy. Now I’m thinking, how are we going to get that out of that. We got that 96 ton sitting on that. There were 98 tires on that low boy, side by side. The whole flat bed was nothing but tires. So he started pulling it out. Well then the dozer got out on the other side. He had to start  shoving it side ways the other way. And then tires were flattened...right flat...rim to the black top. And I thought 500 times, they’re going to start blowing. They kept nudging and nudging. I kept quite a ways away because I thought those tires were going to blow and all the rest of them are going to start blowing. We got that out and brought it down. We had it in place to take it in to the temporary opening. The reactor was 13 foot 1 inch wide, it was 41 foot long. Of course, when we loaded on the truck, we took all of our rigging inside and took it clear to the top and hung our 6 chain falls on there. And then they had the big hook come down. And they had trunnions on it. So when you take it in, they had to tip it to take it up. We started early. We started at 5 o’clock that morning. At 11 o’clock that night we had her set. We took it all the way in, and up and back on to its pedestal. You run them chain falls, and every once in a while, all the load would go into those 16 tonners and you couldn’t pull them. 4-5 guys would have to jump on one another almost...on their backs...to catch up. You know? And we done the whole thing from 5 in the morning to 11 at night and gothert set. [That isn’t something you learn out of a book, is it?] No, you got to switch your rigging. A lot of that stuff... The Lansing powerhouse, the buck stays, when they fired up the boiler, they didn’t have enough buck stays on this. It started to expand and wanted to bust apart. They had to double up everything. They run all the rest of the guys out of there. The ironworkers ended up finishing the whole job. We had 60 foot beams, like 18 inches deep and we brought them in the door downstairs and you had to take them up through the side of the building, tip ‘em, run around, change the rigging all over. We put them all in. And if the crane could reach high enough, you slid some of them through the windows. Take them on around the corner and all the way through the building or around the back. Wherever there’s room to slip all them girders up and through and around. Kept changing the rigging all the time.  19:50 [So did you learn rigging from some old veterans?] Oh yeah. But it’s a knack. You can look around. I used to trim trees around there for the guys over their trailer houses and houses and stuff. I’d just climb the trees and throw a rope over that one. I’d have her or someone else hanging on the rope. I’d say, “When this goes down and over their trailer, as soon as that swings, let go of the rope.” Dump it over there. We done a lot of that. [That’s pretty good. I’ve done work with working loggers and they always have to figure out...] Yeah... [What sequence you’re going to fell it and how you’re going to do it. What to cut...] Yeah...yeah... [What to do...what the terrain is doing and the tree...] Yup. We do all that. [It’s similar...] Yeah, and it takes...experience or whatever you call it. You look it over and you’ve got a problem. Then you sit back and you really look her over and figure out your right move.  20:51 [Any accidents on that job?] Yes. The sheeters were sheeting a building...and this outfit was out of Georgia or somewhere... And they’re finishing a job down there and they were complaining that our trade wasn’t getting it done quick enough. So they brought three guys out of Georgia... And they were on their swing scaffold. They were up on the roof on the parapet wall. The scaffolding was quite long, probably 30 foot or whatever. Three tiers high. You had to pull them up and down rope falls for your positioning. They started at one end of the building and they were zinging right along. They were doing twice the work we were. But here they had wheels... Their out-riggers go on the roof...and up...and your scaffold hangs down. They put wheels... Every time you wanted to move, you went up and moved them manually by hand. Put them in place. But they had wheels on there. They’d get swinging that scaffold and they’d move themselves while they were on the scaffold. But at noon they set in their truck. They were in the beer... And they were going to finish that one day. Well, they moved it...and got to the corner of the building. They got shaken and they took it right off and down she went. The other half of it stayed up. They went 85 feet. Two of the guys went down. Swhooosh. The ground was frozen. One guy was laying on a set of oxygen, acetylene bottle. Broke his back...but they both survived. The other one... When the scaffolding went down, just like a scissors. And he slid out through there and his legs were poked out through there. He just locked in. They got the crane over there and got him off. As I heard later, they all come out of it.  23:05 [When you were a foreman, did foremen get called a pusher...and you got the instructions from supervisors...] Yup... [or whatever...pushing you. And then you’ve got to push the men.] Yeah. [Do you have incidents like that? What are you...] You’ve got to get on them. And then, hey... “It’s my way or no way, ‘cause you’re going to hurt yourself or someone else.” You just get on them. And if you don’t get on them, “Just come out to the office. I’ve got something for you. LAUGHS Your check.” You know? Because it’s--I always want to work as safe as possible. [So you got a push back at the guys from the top who were pushing you to go too fast...but you got to push your men...] Yeah, and you got production. You’ve got to have your production.  23:52 The worse one of them all was--President Johnson had his poverty program. Everybody got a job then. I mean, if you were walking down the street, you’re going to work. We was on the Taconite Mine up in Black River Falls. I worked up there three months. I slept in a closet for three months. There was no place to stay because there were tons of people working up there. I was a certified welder at the time. We’s out over the tracks. I was at a coal bunker where they’d load in the train cars. There were two or three concrete floors and then we was welding the  tanks, the hoppers, together up above. We stayed on our scaffold, took our lunch there. And there was a big power line... The poles were huge, huge. They looked like they were probably 150-160 foot tall. They took power over to the plant. They had a big crane, truck crane out  there, Bucyrus Erie. I think it was dinner time or break time. I think we were eating dinner up there. Of course the oilers take care of the crane when...dinner time, they’d go grease it and fuel it up and everything. This Bucyrus Erie, truck crane, had about 140 foot of stick in it or  whatever. But we’re sitting there having dinner and we heard the crane start up. The oiler jumped in and picked up the out-riggers. He was going to move the crane around. Well, here is that big power line up there. He drove it ahead and hit that thing and KAPOW– an explosion you couldn’t imagine. And here come this ball of fire about as big as your car, coming right at us. We seen it... It was like a quarter of a mile. And here come this ball of fire. And I said, “Shit, we’re going to be had here.” Because we’re the last obstacle setting here up on this tank. LAUGHTER It went right on over our head and hit that pole over there. It had a ground cable. The ground cable was like an inch or better, big around, all the way down. It went ZAP right down through the ground. And after work I walked over there--that was another couple of feet back in the woods--you could stick your hand all the way into the side of that pole where it got so hot and burnt that down.  26:42 But anyway, a day or two later, they had that rig over in our area. The electricians had them big power panels. All that was in them floors—it was all open, it wasn’t sheeted or nothing--but the concrete slab and the toe plate was sticking up, like six inches all the way around. Well the electricians, they swung them panels in there and they were laying flat down on the ground on the floors where they needed them at each level. And there was a young kid, I think he was from La Crosse. He was an apprentice. And it was on the second floor, I was on the ground or something. The electricians went in and they welded pipe across, put the chain fall, their come-along on, so they could tip them and stand them up right. Well, here they had a piece of conduit and one of them broke. And that kid was on the wrong side of the load. And it knocked him, he went right on out. And when it come down, it cut both legs. And he's pinned up here on the stove plate, hanging upside down, blood running out of him. And you couldn’t get to him. There was no crane or nothing around. And old Clarence Laub [Law?] my old buddy from Minnesota, and another old timer from Madison, and they just quick looking around. And they got a step ladder, like a 12-footer or something. The other guy came around with a plank and I ran over. And they stuck the ladder up from the floor below. Stuck the plank out... I got up there and got on that and I held him upright while they got the crane over there...which was way over there. That poor kid. He was begging for God and everything else. I held him for, like, 45 minutes. He died in the hospital later. But talk about a story [chokes up].  28:44 [Leary talks about a foundry accident and asks about accident stories.] Yup. [Is it common to tell a newcomer a story about what would happen if you didn’t do what you’re supposed to?] Yeah, we’d straighten them out right away. If they get funny on the job, and this and that, that don’t go. It’s too easy to get hurt. Where the heck else were we? Up at Genoa,  we had some apprentices come down and they was structural. They drive in drip pins and bull pins and stuff. So when we get down, why we set down and I said, “You’ve got to be good. If you’re going to be good, you’ve got to drive these pins into the beam plates on the ground.” You straddle them and give them some drip pins. They’d beat them right on through. “Now if you’re going to be good, you’ve got to do it blind folded.” So when we’d blindfold them , we’d put the handkerchief around their eyes, but we take their hardhat off. We had the pins there and they had their maul or beaters. So when we took their hardhat off, we’d blindfold him and put their hard hat on the drip pin. LAUGHTER They’d whale away at their hard hat. LAUGHS  30:33 But--and you’d send them to the tool room. “Go get me a lead stretcher” or something like that. They’d go around and ???? all the old timers in the thing. “Well, I just rented that out. You better go to the other guy over there and see if he’s still got it.” You’d be send them kids all over the job. LAUGHS They’d, “They ain’t got no lead stretcher yet. They ain’t back yet. LAUGHS They didn’t bring it back to the warehouse.” LAUGHS [Did that ever happen to you? Did you get set for something?] Oh, I don’t remember yet but they pulled some good ones every once in a while.  31:15 Up in Genoa, it got so goddang cold up there. This job... We almost begged to get laid off. There was nothing to do but the contractor got paid so much and the government or whatever. “Nope, you’ve got to stay. You’ve got to stay.” We just finally made it up, if it got 10 below, we weren’t going out. So we went out to the thermometer outside the shack and we got that so you could slip it up and down. LAUGHS And we’d get a day off every once in a while until they caught up on that. [What would you do on your day off?] SHARON: Fishing... PORK: But anyway... [You’re not going to answer this question?] LAUGHS Go to the pub. SHARON: Yeah. 32:10 We worked on an additional fly ash project and stuff. They put a fly ash slip form up. We done two or three slip forms. Zip, zip zip--150 foot stacks. You got them up in 5-6 days. I was working 8 hours a day on the job and they couldn’t get any more ironworkers. And they was doing a slip form right there. I’m working double shift now. I’m working nights on the slip form, and they had an old, old crane I think came over on the Mayflower. LAUGHS We was up probably 120-30 feet. They had--in the center of the stack--they got the big hopper where they dump the concrete. Then they dump it in the wheel barrels and the laborers run around and put the concrete in the forms. And it’s dark at night, and they bring the crane up. They were using radios. And the guy’s on the platform, dumping. And he watched to clear, ‘cause our rods and our dowels are sticking up about 10 or 15 feet. He went to swing. As soon as he cleared, he’d tell the operator, “Go ahead and swing.” Well, he went up and the operator stopped. The bucket was unloaded, and the operator went to set the brake. And down come that  bucket--shooop--right into the hopper. It’s just a plywood platform and, every 5/16ths of an inch, every two minutes, they’d jack that form. And just luckily, it landed right straight in the hopper. There’s like 14 of us up there. If that would have happened, when he brought it up fully loaded, the whole works would’ve went right down through—everybody would’ve got it. And then we shut the job down right there. Find out what the hell happened. And here one little cotter pin on the brake pedal let loose down there that released that sucker.  34:34 And old Red Philips—the dome, the vessel up there at Genoa, the boilermakers put it up. And they welded scaffolding all the way around the top. They’re just prongs, and the arm come out, scaffold bracket... And they was timber blanks... They were like 10 foot long, 3 inch timber by a foot wide. I mean, heavy suckers. The boilermakers got done and they never took the scaffold down. So the old superintendent, Old Red Philips, he was from Florida I think. And he was one heck of a man. He was 70 something years old. “Come on Pork. We got to get that scaffolding down.” I just worked in the gang then. They had that old crane that they’d lost on that other one. And they had just enough boom to get to the edge of the dome up there with the crane. So now--it’s the big dome--old Red says, “You stay down there and tie on.” We took two ropes. He was up on top of the dome. He ain’t got no safety line on or nothing. He just walked up there, it’s 360 foot in the air. [70 year old guy?] Yeah. And I’m down, and of course the scaffolding is about 5-6 feet down and you couldn’t see him up there. Pretty soon, we got to  work everything back. There was enough hook left--I’d stack a few of them up, and then the crane would swing them out. But for him to get up there, he had to jump on the tip of the crane and go up with the two ropes. One rope would come over, then the other one. There was two planks in each one and he’d give me two jerks and I’m tying on a plank. But he knew what he had a hold of–he had the plank. And when I left, I’d tie one end on the plank and I’d pull it over to me. He’d let it come and I’d go tie the rope on and I’d have the other rope I’d tie on the bracket. So I pulled that one over. Then he knew the bracket was there, he’d pull that up. Then he’d have to walk around and swing it so I could get a hold of it. Neither one of us could see one another at all times, see. LAUGHS So we stripped that all down—and climb back up on the God damn boom and climb down the boom. [Climb down the boom?!?] Oh yeah. LAUGHS Anyway, whatever happened to that rig, it laid there for six weeks. The mechanism didn’t work. Couldn’t boom it, never even got it off of there. Just left it there until they got it fixed.  37:30 But talk about fun. Had a crane operator, Bob Johnson from Eau Claire, he’s probably one of the best I’ve ever seen in my life. I’ve got a buddy who lives down the road here, he was gifted too. 340-50 foot of stick on the big Manitowocs, they’re the Cadillac of cranes. If you wanted a 1/16th of an inch, you got it. You didn’t get this, and that, and that when you were connecting. But Bob Johnson, we were buddies. We followed that same job. We had a bridge across the  river in Portage. And the river goes up and down all the time, so you had to leave your barge out in the middle of the river and spot it because the water is up and down. So we had a boat. Everybody came to work in the morning, hop in the boat. Bob would be out there and go first a lot of times. He’d just swing the headache ball over and I’d ride out all the time on the headache ball. [The crane was on land?] No, it was on the barge. And then we had winches and spuds. You pick ‘em and move ‘em, and then you drop them. A lot of times, him and I were out there, moving the barge. He got to show me how to run the crane a little bit. But every time...I got my gear on there, that son-of-a-bitch took me out in the middle of the river and set me right down to my chin in the water. All my tools, everything. LAUGHS So one night, we partied up and he was late for work. Guess who was setting in the crane seat. He came down over the bank on the headache ball right there and jumped on that thing. Well, guess what happened to him? LAUGHTER What goes around comes around. LAUGHS He never even looked to see who was in the crane. He thought it was the other superintendent, see, but it was me. And I dumped him. So then—everybody got coming to town, we’d go to work in the morning. I’d get on the headache ball and he’d take me up and start swinging around and round. And I’d be straight out, about three circles out there, around and around we would go. He would bring it right now and set you down, just like you’d come over and set in your chair. That guy was good. But now you don’t dare getting on getting on the headache ball or nothing. LAUGHS  39:48 [How important was it to have a really good crane operator if you were connecting...] We refused. If he didn’t give you what you ordered, you’d give him the high ball. Won’t work with him. “You ain’t taking me down buddy.” We’d quit. We’d throw spud wrenches right down at him. Get someone else. “We ain’t working.”  40:08 But what gets you the most up there, that you don’t see, is the wind. You’ve got to get up and go. Usually there’d be a rat race to see who is the quickest. You’d bring up the girder. You’re always setting, making your point. The other guy is over here making his point. Well, my partner somehow was sick or whatever and I didn’t have my partner. We had a guy from...I don’t even remember where he’s from. But...as soon as you got your spud in the hole, you run over and you knock that choker loose. But I never...and it was my own fault. Of course it was with a strange guy, first time up and... He was supposed to be a big hot dog and... I was  keeping up to him and then I was gaining on him a little bit. But I run over and the next thing I knew, the operator let the load down and the girder flipped. I just got to it and got my hand on it... The guy’s left handed and I didn’t know that. I’m right handed...so I’m sticking this and he’s left handed... “You’ve only got a pin at each end...” That first one... “What’s going on over there buddy?” I realized...  41:34 But my biggest one of all--and I thought I had met my Waterloo--we done the detail on the Lansing Powerhouse. And the crane operator--it was a Manitowoc--I think there is 340 foot of stick in it. Well I had a coal bunker. We was lining, putting a coal bunker together. I’m six, eight stories high or whatever. But we had our shack on the roof. I had 42 guys, and I was detailing and all that. They had a man box. Everybody got in, they’d jump in it, he’d zip ‘em up. They’d step out and down into the bunkers and work. I come around the corner. It was just break time. The operator was just getting out of the crane, and I knew he was pissed. And he just threw his hat down. He got into the rig. He had to take my orders, I was foreman. He got in that son of a gun. This box was big as this table and it had a two inch, four foot choker. Stiff as your arm. They had big eyes in them. Well he was--they were connecting with the rig. They had the hook mouth back--the safety hook—they had that wired back so it was just an open hook there. I jumped in that thing and he boogied me all the way, just as hard as he could go. He took me all the way to the top. And I’m twice farther up than the building was down there–where he was supposed to let me off. And I’m “Goddamn it, is he having a heart attack or what? He’s going to run me right through the goddamn jib.” I dropped the blue prints. I’m just going to grab, jump, because I know, I thought he was, whatever happened. He took me right to the top and he stopped. WHAP. I looked up--and that choker come right out of that hook. If it would have went another inch, it would have hit the headache ball and bounced out. But it went up and dropped right back in that hook. I’m over 300 foot in the air. And I just says, “Take me down.” I went right on down to the ground and I stepped up there and I unmouthed the hook and put it back in. But I still see that today--that sucker coming out of that hook. Whoa-ho. [You were going up so fast...?] Yeah, the momentum... [And you jumped in... Wow...] Yeah. When he stopped, the whole load come. We were boogying... LAUGHS [Did you beat him up after that?] No, no... He’s a friend of mine and he is to this day... But they didn’t realize that he was working with connectors. He swung the box over and let them down and they never unmouthed it. Because when they started, they were going to go again. [And he had no idea....] No, he didn’t know it was mouthed back, but he was just pissed because he was late for break. LAUGHTER I still see that sucker up there... [Wow...]  44:46 [I want to ask a couple questions... When you talked about Red Philips on top of the dome. Here is the guy that’s running the job...] He was superintendent [How common was it for a superintendent or a foreman or whatever to...instead of ordering people around...to actually be out there...] Everybody refused that project. He said, “You’ll go with me, won’t you?” I said, “You bet I will.” And he had a son...they were from Florida. What do you call it... He kept him with him, he had to take care of him all the time. He was a laborer. But...he would walk out and everybody knew...and they had their orders to stay away from him. Leave him alone. He’d always walk across the job and he’s always talking to himself and everything. He might pick up a rock and then there was a bulldozer sitting there. He’d start throwing rocks at it, cussing and everything. We’d be up, they’d be vacuuming or something. Pretty soon he would sweep it back and clean it all over. [He wasn’t right...] He wasn’t right. No. But everyone knew that... We kind of got along with him. But old Red, he had to take care of his son. He drove to work one morning, it was frost. He came in...he’d wrecked his car coming to work. All he had was a little peek hole, he rubbed the frost. LAUGHS  46:26 hat one guy, Old Freddie Glenn, he was always late for work and he’d drive just like crazy. He was from Waukon, Iowa. Tires as bald as that all the time. He always boogied in right to the superintendent’s shack. There was a big power pole there. He’d back up to that and he’d jog over to work over there. And he’d go up town every day at noon and he’d come back with a pint of whiskey in his back pocket. Every time he came by me or one of my other buddies, we’d pull a spud wrench out and GONG. Bust that. LAUGHS And he’d, “God damn, you guys are picking on me.” He says, “I sure hope that’s blood.” LAUGHTER But anyway, he was chasing women or whatever, and he run in the goddang shack and he get some after shave, jump in his car, and he’s always the first one on the gate. So a lot of our materials would come in these big crate boxes, sitting unfolded all the way around on real thin boards and stuff. One of them unfolded, it was like 16 foot long or 20. We folded that up and put some #9 wire on it and slid it underneath his car and wired it up to his car. He couldn’t see it. So everybody’s waiting for him. Out the gate he went and down the road, and he’s already doing about 70. And here that thing went swinging around me like—cars were pulling off the road and honking the horn. LAUGHS He took it right on down and there wasn’t nothing left but the wire but he never knew it was behind him. LAUGHS  48:20 [When you were on that job with Red, you talked about using ropes to tie knots. Could  you talk a little bit about learning the knots and where they came into the trade...] That was in  our apprenticeship. We had books tying knots. You can tie bowlines, running bowlines, dragging bowlines. Do you know what a dragging bowline is? Its all on the ground and dragging behind you. LAUGHTER I know all kinds of knots. [Was it pretty common to use different knots?]  All the time, all the time. You couldn’t tie a knot and not even have a knot. You just wrap the other one and it would stay tight. And if you want to release, release it and never have a hitch in it or nothing. [Like a clove hitch kind of thing?] Yeah. I’ll show you what I’ve learned here...if I can find on. I’ll teach you that... I teach a lot of kids that. [I have some rope in the back of my car...]  49:40 [So you talked a little bit about that guy connecting. How important was it for team work and a good partner connecting?] Well, a lot of these guys that run and gun, they’re getting like 2 bucks over scale, hot dogging it. Usually you’d get your own partner. You never have to look at him. You know what he’s doing all the time. Everything. But that wind up there--I got stuck up at the power house one day, the girders--the girds were like 44 foot long and ten inches wide--sag rods. You poke them, and you threw them up and level them up so there’s sheeting. And a storm came up and I’m in the middle of that sucker. And there are just loose bolts. There’s only two bolts in there. That thick. And that sucker was setting there like this. I hung on for like 20 minutes and I’m half--you couldn’t do nothing, but they got the rig over and got the ball up.  50:55 The big job that was really different was the old toll bridge in Prairie du Chien. And that was--about 60 foot above the water--was the suspension bridge. We repaired it. Wherever the cable come down it was 15 foot spans. We had a swing scaffold, two bays full, we could do. There was ten inch high beams and all they had on there was 3 by 5 timbers and they had 1/8th inch by 1/16th inch asphalt slabs, just like tile on your floor. That was on top of that During the period of years, they salted things. They salted it. And that run down on the flanges, the lower flanges of the beams. They got so rotten that the collapsed and curled up like an open beer can. You could drive your fist through a lot of them, see. Underneath is 4 inch X-bracing, and there’s a 18 inch girder spanning the bridge. It’s a cable belt [bell?], and another one over here. There were seven of these ten I-beams. We had formed angle iron and stuff. You’d slap in there and try to weld it to reinforce it. But we had to get the state patrol over there. If anybody hit the bridge over 10 miles and hour and you’re sitting there welding. You about break your goddamn neck if they were speeding. So we got the state patrol right there to slow them down. But any time the wind blew over 20 miles an hour out of the north or south, you’d sway 12 feet this way, you sway 12 feet that way, LAUGHS all day long. LAUGHS  53:53 [Did the heights ever bother you ?] No, no. I froze on the iron once, down at the bridge to nowhere in Milwaukee. But we were on strike here for some reason. Milwaukee needed help.  So we were putting in these false girders, just false work. They had the false work up and we was setting these girders. They were 85 foot long and 10 foot deep. You couldn’t reach your hand to the top of them. And old Red Lingdahl--he was from Rio, Wisconsin--he was my connecting partner. We--my buddy’s from Harpers Ferry [Iowa], it was his birthday the night before--had been drinking the night before. We got smoked. Come out the next morning and Old Red, up his false work, he had a ladder all the way. I said, “Red, you take the ladder, I’ll scan the iron.” And I went up there, 14 inch column or whatever. And you had to go like 40 feet per crack before  you get another brace so you could stop and rest. You had to take her all the way. LAUGHS And I got up to the top and I got my leg over. And, man, I had it, I froze right there. I could not move. But I crawled up the right side of the false work and, now when the girder comes, there’s--all we did was c-clamp the bottom flange down because it was just temporary. And I’m just setting there, sitting there like this. Pretty soon, the next thing I knew, here it is, right in my face, right in my lap: the girder and everything. I looked over and there’s Red over there. And I just clamped her down, and I could not let loose of that clamp or nothing. And I’m setting there. I’m going to go up and unhook, but I couldn’t move. Old Red, he pulled his spud out. Plop, plop plop, up he went. He unhooked that. Whap! [Pork claps his hands.] And I’m out of it just like that. That was the only time I ever got scared. It was just exhaustion from partying the night before. Wore out. LAUGHTER [Do ironworkers party a lot?] 24/7.  55:12 [You mentioned connectors getting more than scale. Is there a hierarchy in the job with different parts, rod busters? Or how would you say who was the highest, lowest in terms of status and rivalries?] SHARON LAUGHS Yeah, they... But I’ve done it all. I just drug this out of my truck today. [Refers to some photographs.] It’s the first time in 26 years I was able to walk to work. I had a... They re-did Highway 35 down here, from here to Prairie du Chien. I had five bridges and seven box culverts. I could walk to work. This might be me here, tying the pier cap, rebar. I worked up in Wausau with L.G. Arnold. We was out on the Yellow River. We had twin bridges across the beltline in Wausau. They were 800 foot long and the water was 46 foot deep. And I learned a lot on that job. The carpenters use sheet pilings, you know, they interlock. And then they pump them out and all that [i.e. pump the river water out of the area enclosed by the sheet pilings]. Anyway, they put their template out there, their big timbers. And that’s where you wind the sheets around them, which you drop them in. You get 3-4 in. But you got to ride--the carpenters, nobody would ride--the stirrups and bring them out. The sheet column was 75 foot long. And they’d swing them out there, and you’d have to get a hold of that sucker and thread it in and start it. The first one, the operator just drops it and tries to make it stick because the current’s so fast and everything. So then you get up on that one and bring the next one and start it. And then he turns her loose—zzzzziiiip--right on down. Turns her loose. And you’re setting on this one, and you never lean back because that other one might come right down and rip your back out too. So you’re just setting on that 16-incher there, and then maybe the whole works behind you. The whole works would go down, one will stay up, one wdown. One down, one up. Well then, you climb to the next one and the next one: and on and on and on and on. And then once it’s all around, they pack them full of grease so when they start pumping them, the water seals--because they have to get that dried down on the bottom of the river.  We’re 46 foot down there. And they clam bucket all the mud and everything. They got to go all the way to rock bed. Well, they drive the piling until they can’t drive them any more. And they get down to the rock bed with the clam bucket and they got what they call a treamy, I think they call it. It’s like a big vacuum cleaner only it blows it opposite. They got like a 600 air compressor. It blows down and out comes the water. And there’s boulders and stuff come out of that thing. And they actually just sweep the whole bottom of that thing. Then they start pouring concrete. They’ve got the big pipe with a hopper on it. And that—zzzziiiip! Nobody’d ride that. So I got to ride that and dump the bucket. They had two buckets, two yard buckets. A rope on one, dump it. You can’t loose your seal, your prime. You could throw a basket ball in there, ahead of the concrete. Set her down and the concrete comes and it don’t get mixed with water or nothing. Every so often you’ve got to keep bringing that up. That gets up and you just stay on it. It gets so high up in the air, well, now you’ve got to cut it off, shorten her off because you’re bringing that level up. So then you lose your prime again. So they pull it out and they cut 20-30 feet off of that pipe, stick her back in, start over again. Throw the ball in and—whsstt--away you go again. But the ball pops back up. And it took us 21 hours that night, in the middle of winter. Cold and oh God, storm, blizzard. But--the crane’s out here in the middle of the river, frozen in the ice--you’ve got a bucket over here. There was two barges. They’d swing it to that barge, he’d pick it up and then they’d send it out to you out there and dump it. LAUGHS [So you’re a pilebutt too, eh?]  1:01:12 Anyway, I learned on that job. How are they going to pump this out while the water is running in? ‘Cause they pump it out, then you could all put your rebar in and all the forms, and the rebar, bring the pier out of the water. I said, “Virgil. You ain’t going to catch up with this goddang water and these pumps down there.” “Oh,” he says, “I got a truck coming, don’t worry about it.” You go down to the paper mill, and he gets a truckload of cinders. They brought them over to the barge. Get a five gallon bucket and you walk around the sink, look over the side where its leaking. He dumped the cinders right down along the side. The water pressure’s sucking it in, it sticks to that grease. It’s like you took caulking right down your window. It was unbelievable. But you had to watch. Any time there was a load coming in, rebar or whatever, if you bump that thing at all, all the cinders would fall off and you’re flooded instantly. You swim out of that sucker every once in a while. LAUGHS The operator would hit it with something, you know. LAUGHS  1:01:23 But we had--they brought 1200 foot of dike across the river. It was 12 foot or 14 foot on one end, these two bridges, and we hit 22 foot high on the other end [i.e. the elevation of the bridge in relation to the ground]. That bridge was in a bend. Here they brought the road straight out, but right out in the middle of the river here are two bridges. But now, we started setting the iron, all the way out to the last connection, it was a double connection, see. Had everything full. We had the bridges. We started. We had all the girders all the way back to open this hole up. We had big jacks, an abutment, against the girders. So when this last piece comes in, you just jack them together and you got her made. Now we’re like 2000 feet down the river, the D-9 cat. It was a cable because our girders are straight. Our last connection, we had to do this [indicates with his hands], bend that in. We made this point, now you have to bend that over. You’re setting on the radio: “Get up on her, get up on her.” You’re riding it. And he’s pulling that girder over there. It’s sticking out about 8-10 feet because it’s straight. And he’s down there, 2000  feet, half a mile down the river, pulling on that sucker, the cable. Of course, the rig is holding it level and you just keep pulling it. LAUGHS Got her together. He’s going to just slide her, then you slide flush plates in there and start pinning her, you know. Got her over there. That son-of-bitch was 5 1⁄2 inches too long. There’s like--how many goddang girders is on that thing?  I think there was like 16 stringers, like 16 girders to do the complete thing. So now we had to shut the job down. What’s wrong? Luckily, all the iron was fabricated right there in Wausau. So we started girder for girder, all the way across the bridge. You get your detail sheets out. This is supposed to be 62 feet 3 and 5/8ths inches or whatever. Every one of them girders was anywhere from 5/8ths to 3/4 inch too long. That’s what got us when we were out there. So we had to ship all that shit back and make new. LAUGHS They plug-welded all the holes and re-drilled everything. [Oh, man.] I was up there 21 months.  1:04:16 [How did you get your nickname?] I was 2 1⁄2 years old and I lived in Winona, Minnesota. The bedrooms were upstairs. I had a little kitten. And I got up early one morning, went downstairs in the kitchen. The kitten was meowing. Well, I opened the fridge and I was going to get some milk. I couldn’t reach the milk. Didn’t have enough sense to slide a chair over, but it was so much easier to pick up the kitten and put the kitten in the fridge. LAUGHS There happened to be a platter full of pork chops in there. When the folks come down there later, the cat was that big around and got fed. So the neighbor started calling me Pork Chop. And finally the chop fell off. LAUGHS SHARON: It’s been Pork ever since.  1:05:23 When I went to school, I never had a class with a girl until I went to high school. There were nine boys in town. Six of them were named Jim. So the teacher--lot of them call me Jim yet to this day—‘cause every time she’d say, “Jim.” They’d all... Then she started pointing to me and all the rest... Everybody ended up being called “Jim” in class. LAUGHS I had an old dog who sat right beside me. For eight years...right beside my desk. SHARON: INAUDIBLE  1:06:10 [So were there many guys with nicknames on the jobs?] Yeah, Darold Coleman. You’ve heard of Orla, the BA [Business Agent]. Well then Vic, he was one tough guy now too. He  knew his stuff. He was the superintendent on the Lansing job. And you come out and if you put a cigarette in your mouth--and he’s standing there--and you took your second match, he’d grab that cigarette out of your mouth and say, “We ain’t got time for this shit”--if it didn’t light the first time. SHARON: What was his nickname? PORK: And another thing, if you had a pipe, you weren’t going to get hired. But his brother, Darold, his nickname is Snaker. And how he got his name, he’s up on the scaffolding and I think they were sheeting or whatever. I wasn’t on that job. But they were picking them sheets up, suddenly a big bull snake was laying under there. One guy grabbed that snake and said, “Darold, do you want this?” “I don’t like snakes.” The guy went like this [twirls his arm] and he gave her a whip up there. It made about two wraps right around his neck. And ever since, that’s how he got his name. Snaker.  1:07:41 You couldn’t get him excited about nothing. Him and Bob Dougherty, the ironworker, he lives in Avoca. Good connector, welder, everything. Good buddy of mine. They rode together from--I think 70-80 miles--they drove together every day. They got off work and they were going back on the Lansing bridge. And Bob’s driving. And they didn’t hardly get off the bottom of that bridge and bump bump bump. The transmission went out of the car. Snaker gets out and Bob’s under there and looking. He was just cussing—mad! And Snaker said, “Well, Bob, you know this could have been a helluva lot worse.” And Bob said, “What the hell are you talking about? What do you mean it could have been a helluva lot worse?” “Well,” Snaker said, “It could have been my car!” LAUGHTER  1:08:4 [Jim and Sharon talk a little bit. Jim: I bet.] Down at the Rack job down in Prairie du Chien, there was 78 foot high, there was an 1/8th of an inch tolerance. Everything was computerized. One fork truck come in and SHLUP SHLUP SHLUP. There was no floor drains in the building. So the rain and the snow and shit--we had like 10-15,000 anchor bolts--every Goddamn morning, we had to dry that whole floor out. We were working composite with the millwrights. Snaker, he’s down there, and I’m back and forth. I come back an hour or so later. I said, “Snaker, you haven’t moved a God damn, done a thing, or nothing. Just been standing there.” He said, “I’m practicing.” “What do you mean you’re practicing?” “Well, you know deer season is coming up.” LAUGHTER You couldn’t get him excited for nothing.  1:09:41 [So how did you dry the stuff?] They took air hoses and start pulling a puddle of water out, and they walked behind with air guns. Just keep blowing. Then they had big rosebuds [i.e. a welding torch brand name, Rosebud Acetylene Heating Heads] and heat the concrete with that and dry it off. [Every damn day?] Every day. It would take 3-4 hours before you could get started to work.  1:10:08 [You mentioned L.G. Arnold. Are those initials of the bridge company?] Yeah. L.G. Arnold. That was years and years ago. Shit. I run all over with them.  1:10:28 [I had an old friend, he’s dead now, he was Ho Chunk. Ken Funmaker.] Kenny Funmaker? Hell, yeah, I know Kenny. [Did you work with Kenny?] Oh shit, yeah, nothing excited him. And the other one... [Max?] Max. Crippled arm? [I never met Max, I only knew Kenny.] Well, there was one more. [Robert? There was a Robert who...] No, I’m thinking of Willie Lonetree. He was a good old Indian worker. And he was with us over there bolting-up and stuff. He’d go right up the iron. One arm, that’s about as far as he could move [raises arm level with shoulder], but he worked with you all day long. [Did he connect with one arm?] No, he just—finishing up, bolting up, filling the holes and stuff. His wife--they lived in Lansing up there--and every pay day, she’d pick them up. He never got a penny. We was giving him money, and this and that. He liked his whiskey. LAUGHS “God damn it, Pork.” For some reason, they brought the checks out early or something. And he said, “Give me a ride to town!” I got him up town before she come down to get his check. And he would get smoked.  1:11:53 [Kenny told me... His dad had been an ironworker and he started when he was a teenager. He hurt his back on the Portage Power Plant. I met him after that. Any memories about Ken at all?] I never worked with him that much, but he was jolly and easy to get along with. Fun guy to be around. He was pretty witty. [I had a few drinking bouts with Kenny. LAUGHS] Well, we worked over at the Portage Powerhouse later on. That was another one of them jobs. We set there for two weeks. They wouldn’t let us out of the shack. Getting paid 10 hours a day. And we were going nuts setting there. We played cards and stuff. It was me and, well, Dick Pankow. They called him “the Chinaman.” Then there was Paul Pulpus [sp?/doesn’t show up on Local 383 rolls] or something. There were three of us. And the guy with the casket and the motorcycle. LAUGHS He made a motorcycle out of a casket. That’s all you’d see,  going down the road, was the casket. Did we have fun with that sucker! SHARON: Yeah. PORK: He pulled in here one morning at 6:30 with his gal friend, and she looked like Dracula’s sister. LAUGHS She’d get in that thing! SHARON: I can’t think of his name. PORK: But we sat there, and they brought a whole bunch of iron, just out in a little different area, a little machinery building two stories high. No blueprints or nothing. And we was setting there. We’d go in and out of buildings, just killing the day. And we kept looking at that iron, and looking at the iron. Paul says, “God damn we better get a rig over here before the superintendent--Big Ray Krause, of course he’s dead now, I think, from Mazo [Mazomanie]. He wouldn’t bring nothing. He’d leave and he wouldn’t come back until quitting time. LAUGHS And there we set and couldn’t do nothing. So anyway, after the second week, Paul says, “Goddamnit, I’ll go get us a cherry picker and we’ll set that son-of-a-bitch.” We set that whole building and we only had three pieces of iron wrong. Just by looking at it, we knew where everything went.  1:14:21 [Well, what happened? What was going on? Were you just sitting around and couldn’t work?] That’s when we worked for Research Cottrell [Hamon Research-Cottrell, a New Jersey-based company specializing in pollution control for power plants, paper mills, etc.]. And that was another one of them--you’ve got so long to get her done, and they didn’t want her done too early. LAUGHS SHARON: Wasting money. [So in other words, they bid more than it cost to build?] PORK: I suppose. Or they were getting some percentage of the manpower on the job or whatever. Well up there at Genoa, that the same thing. We did get laid off. I made more Goddamn fence post drivers, and gates, and tool boxes. That’s how I learned how to weld. Nothing to do but... [Making stuff out of scrap materials...?] Yeah, we had our breakers and our benders, and toolboxes. Make everything. [Do you have any of that stuff around I could photograph in a bit?] SHARON: Well, that swing out there, you kind of wingdangled. PORK: Yeah, I just throwed that swing set together. I think I got a toolbox... SHARON: You’ve constantly made how many things for other people. PORK: Yeah. SHARON: But as far as here... [You’ve got a toolbox?] PORK: I’ve got one out in the garage. SHARON: You’ve got that big thing in the garage that you hang up deer on... [A deer pole?] ...and that thing to bring all that rope together. Pull up the lawn mower and stuff. PORK: Rope falls? Yeah, I got rope falls and shit. SHARON: There aren’t too many people who could just do that. [Yeah, right...right.] Around here. PORK: I have some spud wrenches down there that 99% of these guys probably never seen. LAUGHS [Do you use long ones?] Yeah.  1:16:26 [I heard there was a guy over in Boscobel who’s an ironworker who makes belts and scabbards and stuff. Do you ever do any of that kind of stuff?] No. I never heard of anyone over there... I got a friend over there who is an ironworker. Greg Bell. [Ryan Roth] Ronnie Roth. I see him about every...once a week. He comes over here fishing all the time. [He’s funny.] Yeah, yeah... He lost his kid down in Madison. He was on the wrong side of the load. [That’s hard.]  1:17:13 [Just a couple more questions. This is great, I love your stories.] I’ve got millions of them. [Tell me about booming out. You said you worked for Local 1...and some of those experiences, working with different locals.] Local 1, number 1 out of Chicago, and we finished a bridge. There’s some pictures of it right there. We finished this and we went right out to Sioux City, Iowa, across the Missouri River. I was the first foreman they sent out there. They had foremens from all over: Chicago and Florida and New York and everything. But I was the first one they sent out there. And the day I got that call to go out there, it was a Sunday afternoon and I had my suitcase, and I opened the door, and the phone rang. I heard my business agent, my old buddy Jay Anderson, rolled his tractor over on his farm and got killed. They wanted me to be the pall bearer. At that time, there was no work. And the business agent said, “Well, Pork, if you got a job, go. We’ll get somebody else.” But I never got to bury my buddy. We had a half a week’s unemployment check left. He said, “You better go to work.” There was no work.  1:18:46 [What’s that like when a guy dies on the job?] You shut her off right there. Everyone comes down and you go to the bar. Start over the next day. [And funerals, do they bury...or are there things that ironworkers...do special?] No, not really. [What about topping out?] SHARON: Like when your Mom died, the ironworkers sent you a bible, a really nice bible and a really nice card. PORK: They come personally. SHARON: Condolence card. Yeah.  1:19:34 [Any topping out ceremonies that you remember?] Oh yeah, when that last chunk of iron goes up, everybody goes and chonks her then. LAUGHTER Well, job’s complete, you know. [Any memorable ones that you can think of, topping out, what was involved with it?] No, same routine. But we had the one up at Genoa, it was Christmas time and we got to set a train up on top of the stack up there, just a monorail system to get the material all the way up the top. We wanted to talk to the sups [superintendants]. Well, “It’s Christmas time and we’re going to put a tree on there, and some lights, string her up.” He wasn’t going to let us do it. Well anyway, it got inside the building and got decorated and everything. That was the last piece of iron for us too. Everybody got together and once she come up [the last beam], she got lit up there too. And he come out of the office and never said a word. But he was, no way, going to let us take that up there.  1:20:57 [Sharon, could I ask you what its like to be an ironworker’s wife? It’s always good to get this perspective.] SHARON: Well, when the kids were little, it was pretty rough, because he was never home and I learned how to take our--we lived in a trailer--and I learned how to take a furnace apart and put it together. I can take my stove apart and put it back together because I  had to. I was lucky that I had his Mom and Dad downtown. But--and the kids--he actually missed out on so much when the kids were little because he was never around to see them take that first step and all that, because he was gone away. But then when he got at Genoa, and that kind of thing, it was fine ‘cause he was home every night. I remember one time when he went to Sioux City and he was going to, they were going to fly him back every month. Well, it ended up to be, what, three months. PORK: I worked seven months, seven days a week for seven months. Daylight till dark. SHARON: Finally I thought, okay. I was working at the school and I think Jeff was a sophomore. He was the oldest. The two girls were younger. And one day I just said to my Dad, “I am going to buy myself a car and I’m going to Sioux City this weekend.” So I did. Didn’t know where I was going, nothing. Put all the kids in the car and away we went. First thing we did was hit a skunk so, you know, the car smelled like skunk. Then when I get finally to Sioux City--it’s just so straight and boring, in Iowa, you know--we got to Sioux City and I wasn’t used to driving in a big city and I could see him over there. I could see the job. I kept going around him and going around him. It took me, what, about a half hour before I finally found the turn-off to get over there. And then we lived in this trailer with him, and we got a snow storm. So here we are in this little dinky trailer with three kids... PORK: You can’t open the door. SHARON: We couldn’t open the door because the snow was so high. LAUGHS Oh my God, it was a trip. Then, what about a week we were in there--PORK: Yeah--SHARON: before we could the front door open so we could come back. PORK: They shut the whole town down, everything. There ain’t no stores, gas stations, nothing. They don’t go out and plow it until it gets a crust on it. You’ve got that wind blowing all the time. I kept track. I got my books. I logged everything. Everyday. I got stacks of these books. I logged everything. SHARON: Anyway, actually it’s not that bad. It’s, you know, you just got to do what you got to do.  1:24:26 [Could you make any generalizations of ironworkers as a group, what their life is...?] SHARON: They are fantastic people. They are! Like him, he’s just a specialist. It’s got to be perfect. We would have Christmas parties, the ironworkers would have Christmas parties in La Crosse and stuff. Very respected and I don’t know, they’re, I think they’re good people. I haven’t seen any that aren’t.  1:25:02 [Has he ever burned up his clothes or...anything like that... You know, guys who weld...] PORK: I’ve been in the hospital three different times for 2-3 days at a time and never take the bandages off your eyes. SHARON: Well, you spent the whole weekend doing laundry. His had to be done separate. That’s what you did the whole weekend. Then you’d start on Sunday afternoon, packing him all up again to go. Food and all that stuff. [Some wives have made special gear for their husbands or socks or one thing or another. Did you get into that?] SHARON: I never had to do that because... PORK: We was in our Carhartts [a clothing brand favoring the building trades] so... SHARON: Yeah, they all wore their bunny boots or whatever they call them, and their Carhartt coats. They their own favorite gloves and--I’d do it again. I’d marry him again. LAUGHS  1:26:13 [That’s pretty good. Do you have any last words, Pork?] PORK: I don’t know, we  could go on for 2-3 more days if you want. LAUGHS [Some guys are joke tellers and I’ve heard a few jokes. Ironworker, carpenter, laborer... Any jokes like that?] I don’t know... I don’t want to bring it out ‘cause the language ain’t right. LAUGHS [Okay, okay.] Well, you got, when you’re connecting, I was fortunate enough when I first got in--you don’t hear about rivets any more--I got one job of riveting on one bridge up in Minnesota. That’s the old boys, they showed me how. [Heating and...?] Heating and tossing them up and catching them. Guys would have them go down their shirts, burn a hole in their back and all that--and laid them over. And old Red Lingdahl, from Nelson, he was the heater. And I watched his hands, blistered so much they was as big as footballs, and he’d stay right there and keep heating and pitching them. But he also had his quart of whiskey setting there by the clock too. LAUGHS  1:27:41 But speaking about rivets, they had an ironworker, an Italian ironworker, he’s up on the iron. This is just a joke now. He’s way up in the story, and he said he got to piddle. But he said, “I go over to the corner of the building and I’m going to piddle, and I looka down and I see all the people down there. You can’t piddle on the people.” So he says, “I go over to the other corner of the building, I looka down and I see the people down there. You can’t piddle on the people. I got to the other corner,” he says, “same thing. I look around, people, you can’t piddle on the people.” And he says, “So I come to the next one and there’s a hole there in the iron.” He RRRR RRRR [Imitates the sound of a rivet gun in action, as if a bolt was ready to tighten.] LAUGHS [I thought you were going to say that he saw a bunch of carpenters and then that was ok.] LAUGHS  1:28:22 [Have you ever gotten into it with carpenters?] All the time. We was up at Genoa and they had a carpenter foreman. And he run around, he kept stealing our work and everything. This one tower up there is concrete, deck. And the pipefitters--he’s up doing their work and everything. As soon as you leave, he’s got his nose in everybody else’s business. Well, they had their pee bucket up there and all that. And one day, he was coming up the stairway, up around, and they just opened the door and dumped her on him, about two stories down. I threatened to do it myself a lot of times. But, he was so damn ignorant, you couldn’t tell him nothing. You’d slap him in the face, you wouldn’t even get across a point to him, you know?  1:29:20 If you’re not in no hurry, I’d like to give you a little tour of my place. I’ve got 25 acres here. I got trails. You caught us behind now. We’ve been on vacation. We mow every day. We mowed all day yesterday and the day before. We got one more day to finish mowing yet, with two riders. We got trails out there, mazes. There’s four creeks out through here. Some of them are dead end. You got to turn around and come back. But you go in and hit 3-4 trails, but when you go in there to a dead end, you turn around and come back. When you come back, you’re looking at 3-4 more. Now which one did I just come in on? LAUGHS When I first started out all this. I’d holler at her, “Bring me over a beer, Ma.” She’d be riding right along through these trails. “How do I get there? I can’t find you.” She’s only 20 feet around. SHARON: I can see him but... LAUGHS I still kinda get myself lost in here. [Kind of like going to Sioux City.] Yeah. [So you’ve been here a while?] SHARON: Oh yeah. We’ve been married...47... PORK: 48 1⁄2. WIFE: 48 1⁄2 years. [Wow, I’m coming up on 33 next week.] This used to be a junk yard. Her dad--I had a chance to buy this, I bought it--“You don’t want it. It’s nothing but a fricking junk yard.” And I said, “I’ll clean it up.” We lived in a trailer, right over here by the clothesline. Then we there were 90...no, there were 42 cars taken out of here. There were 91 all the way down through here. And there was another 325 over there. And...everywhere a car set... The guy... All that was left at the sale was the body and the frame. He jerked the radiators out, took the engines out, the money stuff. And the rest set. Whatever’s left after the sale, is yours. I said, “That’s fine. I’ll clean it up.” It took me a little over 7 years but me and Johnny Armstrong and the cutting torch did her But the radiators, the anti-freeze, oil and shit, everything. The grass is dead and rotten. I get that car out of there, and I’d dig all the mud and oil and junk out. I hauled fresh dirt in and seeded it. Then I’d go to the next one, down the line.  1:32:09 Then another guy... Well, he said he’d buy the boom truck which had a smasher. And I had a 10 ton truck and a little Ford truck with a cutting torch on. Well, I’ll buy that. We’ll junk it out and I’ll split the money with you. This went... This was a great big guy with a birth mark on his face and everything. And I’m gone all the time and getting that cleaned out. All of a sudden I’m thinking, something’s wrong here. He’s buying cars and bringing them in. I said, “Freddie, when we clean her up, this place is done, clean and we’re out of here...” Well, then...he was a boozer. It was either too hot, too cold, too many bugs...too many this... And he saved all the little shiny knobs out of the cars and packed them in the cars. I told him, “Freddie, you’ve got 30 days to get your shit and get out of here.” “Well, we got to keep this.” So I got pissed off. I came home one night and there’s a farmer up the road. They had seven cars in a string coming down. That’s what triggered it all. LAUGHS I said, “Now get your shit out of here. And now.” So I got my big propane tank. I walked over there. There are 325 cars over there. And I opened each door, took her under that seat, go to the next. Stick it under, go to the next. I had 125 cars burning at one time. Now I said, “You ain’t got nothing to save any more. You can get them or get what you want or whatever.” “Well, I don’t know...” So I called a car crusher out of...what’s their name? His brother is a state trooper? SHARON: Childs... PORK: Childs. Bob Childs from Boscobel. He put the whole car on. They brought the semi down. “What do you want for them.” I said, “I want nothing. You take them son-of-a-bitches and you can have them” “Oh, I’ll give you 50 cents a piece for them.” I said, “I don’t want nothing. All I want is you to clean them up and get them out of there.” And Freddy’s sitting there, he’s got piles of cash here and everything. And I said, “The first thing you do is take your big machine over there, your big fork truck, and pick up that pick-up with the torch in it, set it up on that 10 ton truck.  He went right over there and set it her up there. I said, “Freddie, is there anything else you want around here? You’re out of here.” LAUGHS He got in the truck and left. But I torched everything over there. He kept bringing them in and buying them, I couldn’t catch up.  1:34:51 [Well, cool. I’m going to shut down here. Great interview...] Harold “Pork” Clausen, Interview Part II  Time  0:01  Topic  Announcement re: one last story.  0:18  Well I worked Sioux City for American Bridge. And I’m up on top and I supply the two river barge gangs with their tools, or rigging, and all that–‘cause there’s a barge on each side of the bridge each time to lift the girders and all that. And one guy was from Kansas City and the other foreman was from Chicago. And they never got along too well. And the guy from Kansas City, he was always a step ahead of the other guy. He always had the rigging and his iron hooked up, rigged up, ready to go the next morning. And the other guy, he was always lax, behind, but when the tugboats would go out, he’d hitch his tugboat up to the other guy’s and take the riggings off of his girders. And when the other guy got out there, he wasn’t ready, and he’d get in trouble. So that kept brewing, and fighting. And we [Clausen and Leary] got talking about hard hats. The “piss pot” is the umbrella one. Well the guy from Chicago, he had his filed down, like a razor blade, all the way around. Well they got into it that one morning. There was ice on the river and everything. And they took their life jackets off and they met right up at the head of the barge. And the guy with the piss pot hard hat, he reached and took it off his head, and he swiped him right across the forehead and laid her wide open. Well by that time, he got decked by the other guy, and it was on the upstream side of the barge. And he knocked him right on off, and down  You want the one about the Sioux City [IA] bridge where they got in a fight? [Right.] under the barge he went. And I’m up on top watching it all. And the guy never was coming up. And I run to the other side of the bridge. Everybody was looking for him. And he popped up, down stream. They got him out of there. Well then the guy that knocked him in was, I said, was the good guy. He was a pretty good buddy. And he just grabbed his lunch bucket, headed for the shack. Figured he was getting fired. And as it ended up, why the other guy, from Chicago, he went down the road. They kept the other guy [from Kansas City]. I thought that guy was a goner. Well, he was gone. They run him down the road, but he’s still alive today I guess. [How many years ago?] That would’ve been 1982. On the Missouri River, Sioux City, Iowa.
Ironworkers;George L. Bunders;0:04 trade? 0:32 and I’ve been here ever since. So I attended high school here, and a couple years of college. I kinda was at an impasse and my father, who was also an ironworker, was a superintendent at a company called Theodore Kupfer Ironworks. And he kind of put it to me, if he could get me an apprenticeship would I be interested in it? And I said, yes, because I was kind of at the end of my rope. I didn’t know what I wanted to do. So that was my start. Started in February of 1960 as an apprentice in 383. I think that one of the other fellows you’ll talk to, Everett Erstad and I started together. His father was a foreman there [Kupfer Ironworks] also. So we, the two of us, went to Kupfer’s as apprentices. That’s where it all got started. So I’m what you’d call a second Topic Announcement, initial question–when and where born, how you got into ironworkers I was born in Milwaukee, 1939, June 8th. Moved to Madison when I was six months old generation ironworker I guess. 2:12 [Tell me a little about your dad? What his name was and where he was from.] I was a junior so he has the same name. George Laurel Bunders and I’m a junior so, since he’s passed away, I don’t use the junior anymore. He started basically in the ironworkers way back in the Second World War. He worked at Wisconsin Foundry and worked on ship parts or something like that. He started working for Reynolds which is a company in Madison. They had a few ironworkers for moving things. He started there and worked for them for quite a few years. There was a big teamster’s strike and Kupfer’s, the two bosses at Kupfer’s and Reynolds were good friends and were at lunch. They offered him a job to come to Kupfer’s to work and he started there as a foreman. Shortly after that, he became a general foreman for them, or a superintendent. He had a 45 year pin when he retired, before he died. And I have a 50 year pin so...we have lots of years behind our belt. [So where did he grow up then?] He was born in Prairie du Chien. He moved...said his sister got him out of the river bottom or he’d still be there. He went to Beaver Dam and began as a truck driver. He used to drive truck for Kroger and Kroger was based here in Madison. That’s where he met my mother, working at Krogers’. During WWII, he got started and was an early welder. He was learning welding when they were using the bare sticks and stuff. So he was in on the base... There was a lot of welding in this Wisconsin Foundry thing. So he had his experience there. As the war ended, the ironworkers were looking for welders and he had experience. Basically, that’s how he got started in the ironworkers, as a welder. At first the ironworkers didn’t recognize welders because there weren’t a lot of them. But then as the trade grew, welding became more prominent. He was then welcomed into the fold of ironworkers. So I guess you’d say that I started in the era of when... The criteria for getting in was you had relatives or you knew someone, which is totally different now. You go through a process of tests and things. Even though I had to take tests for the state apprenticeship, I actually got in because I had an uncle who was an ironworker at one time and my father...and a couple of friends that were in the trade. So I guess that’s basically how I got started in it. 6:30 [Did you have a sense growing up of ironworkers as a trade and a culture?] Well, the only... Not early of course but... I did as my father grew...as he grew into the trade, I was conscious as I grew older of what he did. I would go look at some of the things he’d built and stuff so I had a sense of it. But the actual know-how, I would be the first to admit that I had to start from ground zero. I learned what I know from the people in the trade. 7:20 [Could you say a little bit about that process of learning? How did you learn stuff as you started out? How much did you know going into it and...?] Well, to be very honest, when I started in the ironworkers, there were a lot of farmers. They had worked with machinery and probably repaired things. I have to say I had to start at ground zero. I had to learn my way through what makes a welder work, how to get the engines running, all of this. It was all new to me. So I guess for saying anything in my own stead, I did keep after it and try to watch and learn. I tried to pick up... And I had some really good mentors. I had probably a really good friend through many years who passed away in 1990 who was in the next apprentice class ahead of me. So he was getting done and I was starting. We became great friends and he really kind of led me by the nose, through the pitfalls and showed me what needs to be done to become a good  ironworker. So that really helps to have people there. And I get a lot of knowledge from my father. He was well respected and did a lot of pretty...for this area, fairly good sized projects. He gained knowledge through that and then just by doing it and learning...and not being afraid to say that you don’t know it all. 9:30 [Tell me a little bit more about your friend.] My friend was Dick Higby. He was an ironworker...he got out probably at age 55. He was a foreman at Kupfer’s and we were basically doing the same thing. I became a foreman in the late 60s and so we were working together, doing the same thing for Kupfer’s. Socially, our wives got to know one another and we did a lot of things away from work too. It was a good relationship. 10:20 [When you were first learning, were there people playing tricks on you some?] Oh sure. Apprentices...that was... I think it’s changed somewhat now. When we taught, I taught a—mentors, talking about mentors and how you need to bring these people on--they don’t know. You have to teach them. But in 1960, when I started, the old timers looked on the apprentices kind of like danger for their jobs. And in some aspects, they probably were because I know that at Kupfer’s, for instance, shortly after I started in 1960 and in the 60s, they made a big transition from older ironworker foreman that they had over the years to a younger better trained probably a little more active type of help. So since it was... But we all know that what you can do at 25 you can’t do at 55 so you have to realize that at some point in time, someone is going to have to replace you. Even though you may not think that, this needs to happen and that’s been one of the trade’s biggest drawbacks, I think. They want to covet things for themselves and then all of a sudden, they wake up one day and say, “I can maybe do this but I don’t really want to do this. I want some younger guy to do this.” And so if you don’t train anyone, there is no one there to do it. [Did you have any tricks played on you?] Oh, basically the... In the early years you’re the gopher. They all say, go to the truck and get the come-along. You’d run down six flights of stairs, run back up there, bring it up... “Oh, we don’t need that now. We’re done already.” That kind of thing. It was just general joking, trying to trick you to doing something that they can laugh at. But as you go, if you’ve paid attention and watched. That was one of my pet things as a teacher to tell a younger apprentice how I learned is... You don’t watch the guy that’s a fumble bum...and struggling. You’re not going to learn anything good from him. You watch the guys that make it look easy and know what they’re doing. Pay attention to them. You watch what they do. And most of them, if you talk nice to them, will show you how they do it. They’ll talk to you about how they do it. That’s really much easier than to learn. 14:10 [Years ago, I used to work in the woods peeling popple bolts. And then later on I did interviews with loggers and there was a sawyer who ran a saw mill by a lever and a carriage. Very steady. And there was another guy who loaded with a hydraulic clam onto not just a trailer but a “pup” as they call it. Where you had to load logs but couldn’t really see but kind of feel through the hydraulics. They said you could paint a picture on the side of his loads. Could you talk about some guys who were really good and had good reputations.] Guys would make jobs look so simple. Because I was a certified welder, I did some connecting but we were a small company. You’re talking about school houses and things but I never connected on a large building like a power house and stuff, or a multi-storied building. Some of these guys could... In the 60s, you know what I’m talking about. In the late 60s, they quit doing it but they used to fill  our bag with bolts, climb a column, stick a stud wrench in, sit on it, and wait for a load to come. As I learned and became a foreman, I mean, you can do it that way but it’s a little more dangerous and it’s hard on the man unless he’s really good at climbing. And the potential for an accident is higher. As a foreman, we would try to send pieces so that they could work from one to the other to the other and around in a circle. The first piece, someone has to get up there to make it. After that, if the foreman is organized, he can send the pieces so that they can go to one to the other to the other to the other without climbing up a bare column and sit there, waiting for the piece. There were any number of... A guy by the name of Norm Lenzer who was there when I first started, could walk on anything, could climb, knew what he was doing. He knew how to use his spud wrench. I saw guys who didn’t know to use a spud wrench get caught between the beam and the column, and you can’t get the spud wrench out. It’s bound in. They got it in too deep and it bound in. And the early years, we used to do a double connecting, which now they’ve kind of eliminated. They have a few but they do what they call now an “OSHA connection,” which OSHA had nothing to do with it. The ironworkers were the ones who came up with the idea. They add an extra set of bolts. You have to drill two more holes in the column. Then put the beam that you’re starting with, you have to have two more--an extra set of holes. You can go down there and the guy goes out to the blind column, he puts two bolts in the bottom home plate and tightens them up. He still can make a double connection because that next beam that comes won’t have that. There’s no safety problem. Where the old connection... The connector would have to hold the beam with his spud wrench, take the nuts off the bolts, bring the piece in so it slid on. Try to get a nut started and then bring the piece around and keep holding it with the spud. That all works fine and dandy if you know what you’re doing, but if a column was a little bit out of plumb and the anchor bolts aren’t just right, all of a sudden the column walks away from you. The beam is heavy. All of a sudden your stud wrench is bound. You can’t get it up. You can’t lift it up. Too heavy of a beam. Now it comes time for a come-along chokers and hook it up. Pull it in. It’s like half an hour process, where these guys--the good ones would make it look like clockwork. If you got someone up there that didn’t know what they were doing, all of a sudden you have a major problem. 19:02 [The come-along, is that a choker?] It’s a lifting device with a handle and chain. You can reel the chain out and put a choker on the beam, put a choker on the column, if you had a column above you. Then you hook it up and jack it up, pull that weight up again so you could get the spud and pull it back in. Then sometimes you’d have to put one on the other way if the column was too bad. Pull it in tight and why, you made a bolt. It got... I’ve seen some hairy things. These guys would make it look pretty easy. And of course the walking, which is practically out of the picture now. They’d get fired for that. They’d walk across anything. This Norm that I talked about... He would come to a column and instead of hanging onto the column, walking around and going the other direction, he’d just jump across the corner. He had big long legs and he’d step three-four feet across and keep right on going down the other one, never slowing down. These guys were very good at what they do. 20:22 To be perfectly honest, the things that have changed with safety, with OSHA, because of accidents--if you had an accident, it was bad—but these guys, and I’m talking about a group, a pair of connectors that worked together, that was their trade. That was what they did and they were very, very good at it. I never saw one of them fall or injury themselves. It was usually  people who were not good at it. They’d do something stupid and get injured. But they are also part of the workforce so as safety and insurance got high, the contractor is willing to go by the speed to get it done safely. But as I told a lot of my apprentice classes, some watch some of the old films. What how they worked and watch what they did because you’ll not see it in your day and age. And that’s very true. Now they use these basket booms and take two of them. They go up there and there’s a guy in this basket and a guy in that basket. Then they make the beam and they look at one another to see, well, am I going to get out and take the choker off or are you going to go out? And this was all clockwork when two connecters would work together. They would trade, one would make the live end one time and the next time, the other guy would go. It was the up-most that I can remember, working as a foreman, that if that ball wasn’t down in 30 seconds, he was screaming. “What’s going on up there?” The whole thing was that—“If you can’t make the bolt, stick your permit in it.” They would take...not that it was safe or anything but... 22:50 Crane time and availability were so critical that if there was something wrong with the connection and they couldn’t make it, stick a piece of 9 wire in it or something like that. Wire it off. Let the bolt-up gang take care of it because the crane was so critical that it was needed at another job. You had to be done...well, we’re going to be done here Thursday and the crane had a place to go on Friday. Nowadays, cranes are available everywhere. We used to arrive on jobs, we’d be the only crane on the job. We would be a premium. Everybody on the job would be looking for a—“Jeez, can you give us a pick over here. Can you lift this up for us? Can you do that?” Yeah, later, when we weren’t so busy. Then we used to do it quite a bit. Nowadays, it’s so changed. The first jobs I was one, the old mechanical cranes with the steel booms, without the hydraulic, it would take a day to put a big crane together, a whole day. Now they arrive on a job. The operator can give you 200 feet of boom in ten minutes and do it all by himself. The ironworkers used to--that was one of our things.--the operators liked working with ironworkers because we always chipped in and helped them. Get the riggers out and pick up the pads, put them in... The ironworker always did that because he depended on that operator for your life. He was that ... He was a real plus. And that’s the other thing that made ironworkers easy or hard. You have a good operator, setting steel, no problem. If you’re the foreman and I want that end to go that guy... You take it up 2-3 floors and boom, that guy would have that in. He knew how to turn it, get it to the guy, put it to him where it didn’t knock him off. 25:14 We had an old timer, and he was an old timer when I got there at Kupfer’s in 1960. He didn’t have a huge crane but it would have 85 foot of boom with a jib on it. If you were setting chintzy little stuff that was hard to get out, to get the choker, he would always say just leave it. When he’d get a little slack time, he’d go up there with a hook and pull the chokers off. His depth perception was that good. He could reach up a couple of floors, 60 feet, and put that hook over there. Pretty soon he’d have that choker off of there without anybody... His name was Otto Renewatts [Reneau? Renoir?]. He was a heavy set guy, bachelor, lived alone. He was the primary operator at Kupfer’s when I got there. He liked his beer but he could do the job. These were all pull out riggers on this crane. You’d have to carry it around. He had this big 12 by 12 about foot and a half long... That was always on the back of the crane. We’d say, “do you want the riggers out, Otto?” “Naw, naw. Just put that 12 by under the back or in the middle...” And he’d get something on the front of the crane and it would be four feet off the ground and he’d be  fishing it in like a big fish bowl. He knew what he was doing and he was excellent at it. Until he got a little older and then of course he was, like everyone, did less. Very good. 27:28 [Any good welders, too, that were special?] Yeah, I always...prided myself I guess for being a fairly good welder. I mean there were lots but I said you can teach anyone to weld but you can’t teach, unless they want to, to be a very good welder. Sometimes it is a multiple pass weld. It’s kind of a monotonous type job. You’ve got to want to do it right, to do it good. I always looked at when they start a beam and weld a beam... what it would look like when it finished. Some guys would get to the top and leave a half an inch. They wouldn’t finish what they were doing, finish it off. “Make it look like a tradesman did it,” as opposed to someone that just didn’t care. So it... And that evolved through my time. Welding was really coming on. In fact, at the [Dane County] Coliseum, I was one of the welders on the Coliseum. That was our first introduction to a rod we called 70-18 which is low hydrogen which is used almost exclusively on any structural welds. They even...now, we’ve transgressed to the wire feed even is coming in. In the 60s it was pretty much 100% stick welding. Now, if they got column splices and things, they use wire feed. It speeds it up. It’s more uniform. [Continuous feed?] Yeah, the drawback to a wire feed is that you have to have the spool on the thing. So you can’t carry...like, climbing around on stuff, like that, you can’t climb with it. But if you’re on a multi-story building like this, if these columns where they splice have to be welded, of course, you’ve got a floor. So now you can bring the wire feed there. Sit right by the column and it speeds up that welding process by a ten-fold. You figure that a 14 inch welding rod and you burn it down about 12 inches and you throw two away. Where this wire, you’re just whoossshhh--you may lose a half an inch here or there but you’re not wasting time. You can go clear across or stick if you start and you have a twelve inch column. You’re not going to make it with one rod. You have to stop and that means you have to re-start. The wire feed, you just keep coming across. You don’t have as many re-starts in your weld which is basically where you may leave a foreign particle in there, where you make your re-starts. 31:00 [We’ve talked a little bit about changes in technology with welding. What about welders’ gear, you know... What they would wear so there wouldn’t be sparks in it. Has it changed over the years and what did you start out with, what did your gang wear?] Well, I always wore cotton gloves because of the fact that we were doing more than welding. If you’re sitting on a stool and you’re welding here, you can put on those big leather gloves because they’re heat resistant and sparks don’t get to you. But if you’re welding here and then over there you’re putting nuts on a bolt, they just don’t work. They’re too clumsy. You couldn’t do the things you needed to do. I always wore the cotton gloves with the gauntlet to keep the fire out of your wrist. If you wore just gloves, you’d always get the thing in...and the gauntlets helped. Keeping the fire with the torch. Lots of times it backfires on you. They just improved hoods and devices that we had to wear them on the hard hats. There were a lot of guys who didn’t want the hard hat. Use the old thing. Well then, they said you had to have the hard hat. Then they came up with lots of different ways you could fasten them on. They had little horns on the side and the pins that went into some of them. There was a ring that came over and snapped over it. I used that kind. I guess I preferred the pin ones. They were less apt to get broke. Then you just went and popped it on. That was one sign of a welder. They almost always wore their hard hats backwards. The bill was in the back because if you’re a welder, you can’t have the bill there so that kind of distinguished  us. I think the ironworkers liked it because we thought we were a little different. We always wore them backwards even if we weren’t welding so... 33:43 [Years ago, in the 60s and 70s, you used to see sometimes guys where cotton or polka dot hats with a high crown and a long bill, you wore ‘em backwards and they were called welder’s caps.] I think basically I think it originated to my knowledge fitters, steamfitters, did a lot of sit-down welding. That’s no longer... Their trade has changed so much. They used to get boxes full of elbows and 20 foot lengths of pipe and then they’d sit and weld, and weld on elbows, and make up these pieces. Now all that stuff comes shipped in. Some are all put together and then they just make a couple of connections and it’s all done. Plumbers the same way. It used to take them days to hook up a bathroom in a public building, you know, where they had four or five stools and all this. They’d build it all individually. Now the whole kit ‘n’ kaboodle comes in all put together. They bring it in, they set it on the floor, line it up. Put two anchors in and it’s done. The fitters, just like the ironworker with his hat backwards, a fitter always had these fancy looking hats. Not that some ironworkers didn’t. Some guys wore them. If you were doing a lot of welding, some of them would get, they’d go to the welding shop and get these little beanies. They wouldn’t even have a bill on them. They’d wear that beanie to protect from...and then they’d put their hood over before they’d force you into wearing a hard hat. It’s a little hard to wear a hat under there, although I have seen some. They’d wear a billed hat, turn it around backwards and put their hard hat over that. [This guy was showing me that the bill of the cap...where they had so many seams sown on. That was supposed to mean something...?] I don’t know that. I’m not familiar with that. 36:10 [Do welders drink anything to protect their throat?] Water. I was doing some welding up at the Sheboygan power house. Galvanizing is bad. It’s hard to weld because you have that coating on there. To really get any penetration, you almost have to burn the galvanizing off. While you’re... You’d make a pass with 60-11 which had a little more dig to it and not so much flux. And your first pass would kind of burn the galvanizing away and make room. Then you’d clean that off real good, sometimes grind it. Then put your finish pass on it. I was working one day on this intake and there were these baffles had to be welded on ‘cause the water would swirl in from the lake. There were big plates and they had to be welded 100% up the side. I was in there all day and I was looking around. It was like the whole room was blue... I was in and out, but I was welding a lot. I went to the motel by myself. I got there and I thought...geez. It’s freezing. I was shivering. I got into bed, covered up and I still couldn’t get warm. I deducted after a while that I think I have galvanized poisoning. I didn’t know what to do. I’m there all by myself. So I took some aspirin and finally it went away. But that’s not a good thing. I probably was really close to... And then your tolerance for that, after that whenever I was anywhere near it, I could just taste it immediately. It does something to your body and it reacted to it. The other thing welders--your hair growth in your nose. My nose hair when I was welding would just grow profusely. You had to be trimming it all the time. It’s a protective thing. Your body is reacting to that. Fortunately, the ironworker probably escaped some because we did a lot of welding in the air, in the wind. But like those situations that I was speaking of, where you’re in enclosed rooms, even regular welding was not... I always joked that they put warnings on the welding rod cans about twenty years after I welded. I said, “What does that do for me for the first 20 years?” So...you know... So far I haven’t had any emphysema and my air is pretty good. I feel like I got  away pretty easy. My knees are probably the worst. I had this one replaced and this one probably should be. They got banged. Kneeling on concrete, that was the worst thing. In the winter time, you’d be doing stuff, drilling holes and kneeling on the ground to tighten anchor bolts and stuff. It takes its toll. 40:18 [Could you talk about weather...as an ironworker?] That was the thing. Being a foreman, it was a kind of a funny thing. I kind of got started early knowing that unless I worked, I wasn’t going to get paid. So early in my career, I took the option that saying it’s too cold. If there was any possibility of working, I worked, because that’s when I got a paycheck. Then through my foreman years, it got quite funny. There are those days that it was very, very miserable in the winter time. When it’s 10 below zero, the higher you go in the air, the colder it gets. If you can do something on the ground, it’s a whole lot different. I would usually, as a foreman, try to find something... Like if we would be setting iron and that first two hours are the worst. You’re coming out of the warm car. You’ve listened all the way to the job site, you’ve listened about the wind chill factor. You don’t even know if it’s the same where you are but you’ve heard it. They’re saying this thing...and these guys, before they even set foot out of the trailer door, they’ve already made up their minds that its too cold. So I always tried to get them... “Well, let’s try it to coffee break. We’ll go out, we’ve got something to do. Let’s shake out some iron, let’s do it. Keep moving. Let’s see how we feel when we come in and have a cup of coffee at 10 o’clock if we want to do it or not.” Most cases, we’d end up working the day. And then the majority of the crews said, “No, we don’t want to work.” Then we wouldn’t work. But I found it to be very strange because on Monday, it would be cold. They’d say, “Oh, this is too bad. We can’t work.” Tuesday would come and it wouldn’t be any better. So “Oh, we couldn’t work yesterday so we can’t work today.” Wednesday comes and it was probably worse than the first two days. But in the back of their mind, gee... Two days... If I don’t work today, I’ll only have two days of work. So they end up working on Wednesday in conditions that were worse than Monday because of this thing in the back of their mind that says, hey, I’m not going to have any pay this week. It’s just a way...human nature. You just can’t... 43:30 [It reminds me of a story a logging camp in the UP. Big Eric Erickson got together with his men Monday. And said, “Well, boys...it’s Monday...and its pretty cold. Pretty soon it will be Tuesday...and Wednesday... We don’t have no work done yet.] LAUGHS 44:02 [So how was it being a foreman, the pusher...?] The head foreman you worked for... There are guys you enjoy working with. I guess I was the type that I didn’t tell anybody to do anything that I wouldn’t do myself. And I worked with them most of the time. There are times when you’re setting the iron, you’re reading the prints. There is no way that you can do that. That’s your job and you have to be doing it. But when that was done, I was up there doing the same thing they were doing. So I was not asking them to go up there and freeze their butt and me sitting in a trailer, looking out the window. If they were working there, I was working there. I found that I think guys respected that. I was able to get them to work by respect more than screaming at them and telling them “Get doing this and doing that.” I always said “If that’s what a foreman has to do, if I have to scream at people and make them ugly to get them to work, then I don’t want the job. I’ll just be one of the guys that works.” It seems to have worked out for me. I was real fortunate in my later years and I would go to work for people who had work for me.  They would say, “What do you want to do?” And I’m like, I thought I was supposed to be told what to do. I felt good about that...that I didn’t burn bridges behind me because there were people out there that would play the big time and then you’d learn, if you were in the trades as long as I was, that you can be top dog one day and the next week you might be down here-- because I see the cycling in the company. One company could do no wrong for a while. Get every job that they bid. Then they get enough work so they coast a little bit. So then the next guy steps in and he starts sharpening his pencil. So he might be the big dog here, but then all of a sudden, “Oh, this is the last job we have and I don’t know where we’re going next week.” You might be the top dog, but see ya. Now you’re over there, working for that guy and someone else is up there... So you learn quickly, don’t burn too many bridges in one place. 47:24 [Did you boom around to many places?] I didn’t...well... I don’t know if you’d call it booming out but the first... I worked for Kupfer’s for 25 years. The first 15 or 20 of that, I mean, I spent more time out of Madison than I did here. We had a lot of work in Kenosha. Rockford, north Chicago even. We went as far as north Chicago. I had guys from Local #1. I had guys from #63. Local #8, #498 in Rockford. We were pretty much gone a lot. Being that my father being the superintendent, and he was telling me where to go, I didn’t really bitch too much. I’d say, okay... I thought about it a lot of time but I figured he had a lot on his plate anyway. There were guys who would whine... “Why do I got to be the guy who goes there?” I was down in Kenosha. I was stuck there doing 3-4 jobs in a row. One would start one after another. “Well, you’re down there, you can do this.” I was ready to come home and have someone else do one. But that’s the way it was. 49:00 [Would you live in a motel or...?] Mostly. Yeah. We started back in the days before we had... When I started in 1960, there was no nothing. The contractor didn’t have to pay you anything. If you decided it was too far for you to drive, you stayed over. So we’d find the most cheap motel. I remember staying down in Kenosha in a motel for $2.50/night, no bathroom ...one down the hall. Sink in the room, no shower. Living on a second or third floor of a rickety old hotel. One of the first jobs...a big school, Tremper High School in Kenosha. We had this job trailer, they bought a new semi-trailer and we outfitted the thing. We put bunks in it. It was the job trailer but we put bunks in it, three of us slept in it. We had a plug in. They hooked power up and we had an electric heater which was sufficient. But we’d bring a camp stove and everybody’d bring something along. We’d eat at least a couple three meals in there. We’d stay in this job trailer basically. At that time, I was working out of the Milwaukee local and they did have... You got... First it was $3/day and then if you went back on Monday, you would get paid for Saturday and Sunday. So that was, 3 bucks, that was $21/week. That was your money to stay out of town. Then Milwaukee went up to $5, and that was $35/week. Working in Milwaukee, the scale was higher...then the $35/week, I did pretty well. It didn’t probably cover drinking beer at night, but we rented an apartment over a tavern in Kenosha. There were five of us and it cost $80 a month and they had enough beds for five of us to sleep up there. We had a kitchen and two bedrooms and a living room. Five of us slept up there. It did have a shower and a bathroom upstairs. And with that, we paid $16/month, 5 of us paid $16/month [each]. That was about as cheap as you could get. That was about half of our $35/week and the other was spent on food and beer.  52:26 [Was there a lot of beer drinking?] Yeah, that’s part of the thing when you were young. That’s another thing you have to learn how to pace yourself with that. So many of them... Luckily I got through it or had enough brains or what and made it through. After I started teaching the apprentices, I would come in after drinking... I have to admit that the 60s was a much milder with drunk driving and all that. I mean now they are all over. You get stopped, you’re had. Back in those days, they might tell you, “Get your ass home” or “Get off the road.” They don’t do that anymore. I would see it in some instances...I could see it coming with premises. The last one all I can remember is down at University Hospitals. We were working there and we got rained out early, like 10 in the morning. “Oh, let’s go to the tavern.” We went out on University Avenue, had a drink, and then we got just about to noon and I thought, “It’s time for me to get out of here because I could see this coming.” So about that time, here comes one of our bosses, we were working for Findorff’s then. So one of our bosses came in. He had left me in charge and he comes. Fresh money. So he buys a couple of drinks. I had two more and then I got out. The next morning, we get to the job and this one young dude... “I wonder where Dean is today?” “Dean didn’t show up.” About 10 here he comes, head hanging down. “I got drunken driving ticket last night.” “I don’t like telling you this but I could see that coming.” And then... I don’t know how you... Either you’re lucky or you’re a little bit smart but he got clocked going 55 on a city street. To me, that’s not too smart, especially if you’ve been drinking. You better follow the rules. That kind of thing happens. 55:11 [Years ago, you hear about some guys drinking on the job...] When I first started, the joke was... If you said, “Well, we have a job in Platteville.” It wasn’t 80 miles to Platteville, it was how many six packs it took to get back from Platteville. That was the standard. “That’s a three six pack job,” so then you knew it was at least 80 miles away. I thought that was kind of a joke. 56:00 [So did you work with or meet some characters...?] Oh definitely, there are a lot of characters in the ironworkers. I enjoyed working for the guy because he was fun to be around. By the name of Charlie Miller. He lived down by Edgerton and worked at Kupfer’s a lot. I worked with him on and off. Then he moved up by La Crosse and my parents lived up along the river so I had a project up on the St. Francis Hospital in La Crosse. Charlie lived on Stoddard and my parents lived at Victory so he came to work for me up there, working out of La Crosse. I said, “Charlie, I’m driving the company truck and living with my folks. I drive right by your place so you might as well ride with me.” So yeah, that sounded good to him. I’d pick him up in the morning. That was a hot time of the year and there was a little tavern down the street. We’d stop and have a couple of glasses of beer. We’d usually have 2-3 and then head on down the [Mississippi] river. I was sitting there one night and I told him when we went in, “Charlie, my parents are going to Prairie du Chien. I have relatives down there and I’m riding down with them. I can only have a couple and then we’ll hit the road.” So every time I’d turn and talk to someone, and every time I turned my head, I’d look back and my glass would be full of beer again. So...we had about 4-5 and Charlie said, “Okay, are you ready to go?” I said, “To hell with you. Do you think you’re pulling the wool over my eyes? I see what’s going on over here. You just think I’m going to leave now. I’m too late to go with my parents. I’m staying now.” So he continued on for another hour or so. I dropped him off at Stoddard. The next morning I come and I pull up in front of the house. No Charlie comes out. I wait a little bit and pretty soon the door opens and  he comes out. He’s humped over and gets in the truck and says, “My chest hurts so bad. I got home last night and I sat at the kitchen table and I got one shoe off and I passed out and fell down. I laid on that shoe all night long. My wife wouldn’t even get me up. I laid on that shoe. It feels like it’s right through my chest.” I said, “Serves you right. That’s the pain you get for being like that.” He was a character. Tell jokes...he could tell jokes. Just mention a subject and he had six jokes... He worked for me with another job by Hales Corners. We used to drive that and stop... He’d come from a different direction and we’d get there early. We’d stop and have a cup of coffee before we got to work. We’d go in this restaurant and its busy. There’s a couple of waitresses and they’re just working their tails off and their ugly. They’re not happy. Charlie comes in there and starts telling jokes. First no one would make a sound. Then a couple of people at the counter would start laughing. Before we left, he had both them waitresses just about falling down in the aisle. They were all happy and when we first came in, they were about as ugly as you could get. He was quite the guy. 1:00:19 [Did nicknames come into play much?] Oh, yeah. I think you talked to Dave Nelson, he always went by Tinker. I worked a lot with Arnie Freitag and his actual name is Harlan and hardly anyone called him... It was either Arnie or Harnie...or... Nick Rochon, we worked with him. He had long hair and a big beard all the time. We called him The Roach. So there were lots of nicknames and stuff. 01:01:10 [We’ve talked for over an hour...and it was a pretty good session. Do you have something that I didn’t bring up that you’d like to mention?] I guess...you know...talking about the general working situations... I felt like I was very fortunate, like I explained. I got my start and then my really working at learning...and doing extra curricular things to learn more. Just pure luck of going through probably one of the early 80s, which was about as bad as it is today. I happened to be sitting in a good position. I had a good job and I was foreman and they still had work, so I slid right through that. The 60s when I started, I mean... There was a shortage of good help. They were looking, the jobs were just popping up. Kupfer’s would get so many jobs. I remember my Dad saying that they had so many jobs on the list, and he’d say, “Bid it high.” And they’d still get it. It didn’t make any difference. They had these clusters of little contractors in these little towns and they were all busy. If they got a job, we got the job. It was almost automatic, even though it was done by a bid process. They weren’t looking anywhere else. They were looking at Kupfer’s. I remember in the 60s my Dad telling the foreman before I was a foreman that if they were setting steel, putting up buildings, you don’t do any finish work like stairways. That was only done on rainy days when you could go inside. Otherwise, they were just put on the table. When a rainy day came along, he’d reach in the pile and say, “Here’s an inside job, you can go do this.” But there was so much stuff going on that they couldn’t, they needed to get it up in a certain point in time. They had so many miscellaneous jobs like that. 01:03:53 I remember working one period... I think it was almost 6 months. I’d put up a little steel here and there, but basically did ornamental work. Stairways, railings, cat walk here... I did that for almost six months. Sometimes you have to write down notes, because I’d forget from Monday to Friday... I’d be saying to the guys, “Where were we at? What were we doing?” We might’ve had three jobs on Tuesday.” And if you don’t write it down, pretty soon you’d have it all jumbled in. I didn’t even know what to put down. So you had to, I’m sure you had people  with equal talent as me just weren’t as lucky and didn’t hit in the right places. I was very, very fortunate and the other thing was that I didn’t burn any bridges. I kept... I never was turned away. If I got laid off from a company and the next time they called for a man, they didn’t say, “No, I don’t want George.” I went back to work there because I didn’t do anything to mess that up. 01:05:28 [Is this trellis or swing set your work?] Yeah, I just built that swing set for a little girl. [Was that pretty common for ironworkers who were welders?] Yeah, some do. Eddie [Smith], who you just saw. He’s really into it. He sells at shows and stuff. He’s made a lot of that stuff over at that electrical thing. He’s getting very talented at that. I made that trellis there. I volunteer over at Habitat [for Humanity] at the store over there. I found that stuff over there that came from Springs out here, the place that makes the blinds. When they brought those things in, they were curtain rods. I thought I could do something with those...so I made that trellis. I made a couple more of them and they sold ‘em. They were having kind of an art project sale and I made a couple and sold ‘em at their thing. I don’t know what they were sold for...$35 or something. It didn’t take that long. And I’ve got a trellis thing and a gate over on the other side that I built. That light post out there, I put that together. [I want to take a few pictures here.] The stuff I picked up and cut it down and made it to fit what I do. I’ve been doing... Tomorrow I probably got to call this guy from Habitat. I do some welding for them. On their jobs they have things to store, propane tanks and stuff. And OSHA of course wants them to be in a cage. I made some frames and he was going to bolt them together. He called back and he said, “I think it would be a whole lot easier if we welded that together.” So I got to do that now for him. That’s what I prefer to do. I’ve got a little scroll-bender, like Eddie [Smith], some of the stuff that he does. I haven’t tried to... I’ve done projects where people will pay me for my time but I’ve tried not to get into it as a business because then, to me, it’s like I’m back working again. And I like it where I am now. So I love to do...to fix things for people and weld things for them. Most of the time I don’t charge them anything. 01:08:28 [Years ago, would there be much scrap on the job?] Oh yeah, and that was another thing about working at Kupfer’s. They were a fabricator. The trucks, we always carry extra angle [iron]. Every job had something left over. Pretty soon the truck would have a ton of iron on it and what am I going to do with it? So I stored it in my garage. I’d put piece of angle scrap out of the railings that came out with a piece of strap on it to keep the pipes spread. You knock it off and what are you going to do with it? You throw it on the truck. I had all this iron. So my wife was saying, “What are you going to do with all of this stuff?” I told her, “Don’t worry, someday I’ll use it. And gradually...I built a lot of things out of that. It just blows my mind when I go to the store and buy from Wiedenbeck’s and I’ll take the bill and I’ll say, “See why I kept that stuff? See what that piece of angle cost?” “Oh” she’d say. LAUGHS 01:09:44 [I’d love to make copies of these. Is that you in that picture?] No, this is a gal...and was taken in Kenosha. She came out of... She was an ironworker from Alaska and a lady... This is back in the early 80s, so women were pretty new to the trade. She came out and worked on that job. 01:10:25 This is Baraboo, the courthouse in Baraboo. That was a job that I went in the hall. And  that’s McFarland’s and Sauk was the fabricator. I went into the hall, I was out of work and Sam [Wilcox] said, “This Marcon & Johnson [sp?] is going to build this building up in Baraboo... This is a picture of it here. And they want a foreman to run the steel for a couple of weeks because their major foreman setting steel is going on vacation. So I said sure...I’ll go up and see. Someone from the company didn’t tell the superintendent. So I go up there and go in the shack. There’s no one in there so I’m looking at the prints to see what it consisted of. The superintendent comes in and he’s like, “Who are you?” And I told him that Sam sent me up here because you needed a foreman. Well nobody told him, he didn’t know anything. So I just left and went home. I get home and Sam calls and then the superintendent calls and he goes, “I’m sorry. I didn’t know. I didn’t know that you were supposed to come here.” So the next day I went back and as it turned out, apparently they were pleased with what I did while the guy was gone. So they had me continue to erect the iron, and when he came back, he did the detail work. It was a nice job. 01:12:39 [These are some topping out...] Yeah, that was the beam, the last beam. There’s a picture of it going up from there. That was something I took on a vacation. When I go on vacation, I’m always looking at iron. [Is this one, the one with the beam...] Yeah, that’s the last beam. [In Baraboo there?] Yeah. There’s a picture of the connectors waiting for the last piece. PAUSE 01:13:20 This is kind of a different deal here. This was in Sparta and this fence was around a square in Sparta. We took... This Jim Hind, who was a Findorff guy that got killed on the job... We were out there and we had to cut this all up in sections. They sent it back to the shop here at Kupfer’s. If you go by the governor’s mansion, this is the fence from there. 01:14:09 [That is kind of spear looking—in reference to a fence.] Yes, and it’s all cast. They took the parts and made enough so that it could be put up around the governor’s mansion, all across the front. [This is you here...] Yes, this is me and this is young Jim Hein there. I look a little younger there for some reason. LAUGHS [Leary does some copy photo work and talks about working in a foundry. George shows photos, including one of his apprenticeship class.] This is Everett, the one that you’re going to talk to...when we were young dudes. And here is a guy by the name of Jimmy Carter. [Did that come into the trade much, a sense that some people were Irish or German...?] PAUSE 01:16:38 This was at St. Francis Hospital up in La Crosse. [This is lunch with people...] Yeah. This was the bunch that we had up in Baraboo. [What building is this up in Baraboo?] It’s the county courthouse. Yeah. 01:17:55 [That would have been in 1960...] That would’ve been in 1963. I started in 1960 and this was our finishing up the apprenticeship. That’s the governor’s mansion or the remainder of it. I had a piece of...right where that trellis is there [from the ornamental cast metal fence]. I had it up and using it as a decoration in the thing because it was pretty historic. We had a tornado go through here in 2004 and blew a big limb out of the tree and just smashed the thing. Bent it all over. I finally ditched it. [Oh no. Okay, I think I’ll turn this off and play it back...]
Ironworkers;Edgar L. “Ed” Smith;0:03 Announcement, initial question–when and where born, how you got into ironworkers trade? 0:50 I was born in Vernon County, Wisconsin, at Kicakpoo Center in February 14, 1940. We lived on a farm. My grandfather had 440 acres at Kickapoo Center and we were basically, my father was working with my grandfather. 1:28 [Anyone you knew in ironworker’s trade?] Not really. Of course, you’re a young kid and everything is new to you. But because of WWII, my parents decided to move to Madison, Wisconsin and work in the war industry. My mother went to work at Oscar Mayer’s and my father also worked there in the beef kill for many years. Eventually he retired from there. But it was my good fortune to grow up in Madison, attend school here. Needless to say I ran into and encountered more tradesmen in my young life. I attended Madison East in 1953 until 55, at which time, I had no choice. I had to go to Monona Grove High School, it was a brand new high school then on the east side. Got involved with the shop classes. I had a couple of good instructors, although I’ll back up a minute. I also had some excellent shop instructors at Madison East. And so I enjoyed working with my hands. And then my father was also a carpenter. So I got a lot of hands-on training from my father. I decided early that I liked working with my hands but not necessarily as a carpenter. Too much vegetation or vegetable matter to work with. But I did like working around iron and different metals. So back in the 50s or early 60s, it was pretty common for guys who didn’t want to go on the college track, that we could go down on Park Street, er, it was Butler Street then where the old labor hall was. You could walk in that door and literally go from office to office and speak with the business managers and the BA’s [business agents] and find out what the employment picture was. Back then I was too old to come in as an apprentice because they had an age limitation back then and the only way you could get in is if you were coming out of the military and then they would waive that. Otherwise you had to be 18-19 to get an apprenticeship. But they had a system that was called “permit workers,” and if you were lucky enough to get on, you could work on a permit until you kind of proved yourself. Then they would approach you about joining the local. That’s how I got started. I started out on mostly bridge work, highway work. Long hot days. Hard work physically, but I did like it. And I liked the guys I got to know and work with. 5:13 [Give me your parents’ names.] My father’s was Herbert Newton Smith and my mother’s maiden name was Opal Pearl Hoke. [I take it you lived on the East Side?] Yeah, we lived in Monona Village, at that time, before it was a city. Lived at 205 Nicholas Road. [Some suggest that the East Side is an old working class part of town...?] Oh very much so, yes. Absolutely. [Could you elaborate...about what your neighbors had done or what the...?] Very little industrial base on the West Side of Madison. It was almost entirely on the East Side. Some of it is still there. Most of it is gone, unfortunately. By far and away... I always referred the fields of the East Side was middle class working people. All the 8 to 4:30 people. We used to have the Capital Times paper which was the evening paper. And most working people got the evening paper because they didn’t have time in the morning to read the paper. They got the fresh news in late afternoon. Pretty much our daily ritual was my father sitting down and reading the Cap Times. Then discussing things [laughs]. It was usually one-sided... [chuckles]. Just a remembrance. 7:20 [You mentioned Oscar Mayer’s. What were some of the places where people worked in?] You had Madison Brass, the printing outfit out there. You’re making me stretch here a little bit. Oh, Ray-o-Vac Batteries was at Union Corners. That employed a lot of people. Gisholt Foundry was alive and well and busy. That started out with a guy by the name of Johnson and he basically was in farm equipment when they first got going. Then it evolved in Gisholt’s. We used to call it the Norwegian poorhouse. LAUGHTER [I have a friend, George Gilbertsen, who lives on  Waubesa Street, who is on the Ramblers...] You’re kidding. No, we talked...yeah....yeah... [So he lived right up against the rest of those...one of those foundries...] I think I know what one. LAUGHTER The one that they claim pollutes. [So what year did you start there as an ironworker?] I came in during the early 60s on a work permit for a couple of years. Then a business manager approached me on the job site and at that time, you needed two journeymen to sign and vouch for you, which they did. Wesley Roscoe and Swede...Swenson. John Swenson...his brother... Boyd Swenson was a superintendent ironworker for Findorff Construction then and he was the other guy who signed for me. [So what outfit were you working with on permit?] Well, they kicked you around a lot when you’re working out of a mixed local. By far and away, most of our members worked for various contractors. I had one year that I literally worked for 30 some contractors. When I had my taxes done, the CPA looked at me and says, “Jesus, son, can’t you keep a job?” He had no understanding about how our system worked. I really liked it because I got so much diversification in the work that I was doing. Of course, when I came in I was just a little dumber than a stump. Over a period of time, and thank God for the old guys, they kicked you in the butt and point you in the right direction. So I did not...was never formally trained as an apprentice, although I did pick up a set of training manuals. I still have them today. Much smaller than the new ones. But anyway, basically on the job training. I always enjoyed going to work. That’s one thing I have never felt bad about...or wanted to take the day off. Between the guys, the type of work, and learning...just the whole experience. Working outside. Perfect view every day at the office. 11:08 [Tell me about some of the old guys that you learned from.] Herb Tiedeman. Syd Erstad, the foreman for Kupfer Ironworks. I think I worked for every one of the old foremen at Kupfer. They just put you where they needed you. Crews were always intermingling and changing man power from day to day. You never knew where they were going to send you. You’d go to the yard in the morning and the field superintendent would come in and say, “You, you, and you, you’re going there.” And so on and so forth. So it’s a must to bring all your tools, finishing tools, rod tools, welding tools, structural tools. That was your kit and you needed it almost daily. [So when you were learning sort of the ‘school of the hard knocks’, what was your technique or how did... Did you just watch people, did people yell at you sometimes or show you things?] Oh yeah. I’ve been referred to by many derogatory terms when I was young. But at the end of the day, you knew they liked you. They were going to take care of you. It was just their way of expressing their feelings at the time. You’ve got to remember that some of these guys never finished high school. They came up the old way. Hard work and you learn as you go. Someone taught them. You have to remember that even if you do away with a formal apprentice, the apprenticeship will survive because it’s the oldest job learning technique in our history. It goes back to Biblical times. If you’re a girl, your mother is the one that taught you how to cook. Your dad taught you how to change a tire on a car. That’s an apprenticeship. It’s learning. It’s an experience. [Do you remember any derogatory terms that were directed to you?] Well, let’s see. You’re a waste of skin. That was pretty common. They didn’t like long hair. That was kind of a no-no back then because you were either a hippie or a subversive, one of the two. [Chuckles.] Some of the young guys used to get haircuts “voluntarily.” [Not Nick Rochon.] LAUGHTER Nick Rochon. Where do you know Nick Rochon? [I’ve got pictures of him from a story that Dave Nelson...] Tinker? [Yeah.] Tinker...his shop is just over this hill here. You can just about throw a rock and hit that. He was one of the classics. He got his hair cut at the...  Well, we were building the Dane County Coliseum. I remember it quite well. [laughs] [Can you describe what happened?] [Laughs] Well, they just cut his hair. Well, they shortened. Let me put it that way. And Nick wasn’t terribly happy about it as I recall. But yeah-he went home lighter that night. [Laughs] [So they might have grabbed him a couple of times...] GIGGLE Well, they might have, yeah. 15:14 [You mentioned having to go to the job with all these different tools... How did you come by your tools?] Well again, if you keep your mouth shut and your eyes and ears open, it’ll take you a long way. You can’t be afraid to ask questions when something important, or you feel its important comes. So when you start out...and you go... “Where did you get that stud wrench? Where do I go to get me one of those...? How much are they?” The old guys would tell you, “Well, you can get them here, here and here. And they’ll cost about...” Ornamental tools? You’re not going to find too many ironworkers that don’t love hardware stores and Farm and Fleet stores and any stores that carry multiple use tools. You watch and of course experience...and some of the old guys... The good ones will show you how to correctly use an adjustable wrench, for instance. Any tool...the air tools, the impacts [impact wrenches] and everything. They will show you the way. Then they’ll kind of kick you in the butt every once in a while if you’re doing it wrong. And so basically that’s the way we learn. [Did anyone ever make or modify or...] Oh, strictly, certainly. Because everyone’s hands are different size, different length. Maybe you’ve got long fingers and small palms, vice versa. So you’re going to have to adapt the tools to your liking. Like a sleever bar, you can go out there and structural guys... You can run up to 10, 12 structural guys and you’ll notice their sleever bars all have a little tweak or tick to them. They’re not all identical. And of course, you know, small guys are going to be a little different than the big guys. So on and so forth. That was the other nice thing about the trades. Everybody isn’t 220 pounds and 6 foot four and 20 years old. You have to adapt with different size guys, different weights, different...so on and so forth. And when you’re working with stuff and you’re in a pinch. You gotta holler out and get some help. If it’s too heavy, too long, too short, whatever. That’s all part of a team. [So with your tools, are there some that you’ve modified or customized in particular?] PAUSE You can take a 12 inch adjustable wrench, for instance...commonly referred to as a crescent wrench. You can literally run the screw back off it and get the travel to go longer. It will open...the jaws will go wider so you can make an adjustment on that wrench...when you encounter different sized nuts and bolts and things that you find you need to do that. Your rod wrench, for instance, your hand... You’re going to heat up the lower handle and put a bend in it. There again, one guy’s bend is more than the next guy’s. So on and so forth. You work it until you fit your hand, not theirs. Well...why you kind of got me here. I’m not thinking too good. [That’s okay.] I’m not an interviewer. [Have you ever put your name or initial anywhere...?] Oh sure, you’re going to either mark it with slash marks, paint isn’t permanent so you won’t see much of that. Carpenters, they’re more into painting or something like that to mark their tools. Most of ironworkers’ tools are either notched with a grinder or else you weld your initials or first name or something on your wrenches or that, especially if you’re on a powerhouse job or real large project where you have many, many ironworkers because, yes, if you look at a spud wrench, it’s a spud wrench. It’s pretty similar. And so on and so forth. 20:12 [Do guys ever...prank with someone?] Glad you asked that. We were working up to  Manley Sand and Gravel many years ago and Ray Spangler--as I remember right, Ray was single but he had nieces and nephews. Ray had a tendency--he always packed his lunch. He took a lot of grief. He had been to the old Treasure Island Store which is long gone now... Treasure Island used to set where American TV is now on the beltline if I recall. They had run a real special on Easter candy--all the hard candy on the outside and soft stuff in the--eggs, candy eggs. Ray had bought just a ferocious amount of bags of this candy for his nieces and nephews. He would drive the car up to Manley Sand and Gravel and park. We’d go to work and John Schuepbach, he had a pretty playful way about him. Unbeknownst to him, he would periodically come out and ask Ray if he could borrow his car to run into Portage for something. Maybe 2-3 miles outside of Portage was where Manley Sand and Gravel was. We went up there and bolting up and... We were bolting up the structural, as we go from point-to-point, we kept finding these stupid Easter eggs. [laughter] They would be anywhere--under the beam, behind a flange, it was just crazy. At first we started eating some. They were pretty good. Who doesn’t like sugar? Ray just couldn’t get over that. None of us could. At the end of the day, Ray had to go home and he discovered that his Easter egg candies were gone. Ray didn’t finally catch on to...who was using my car? Ahh, well, he got to locking his car after that, [laughs] especially when he discovered that his Easter eggs were gone. [Laughs.] That was a humorous situation. 23:05 [Can you think of any more?] We were down in Monroe, Wisconsin... I can’t remember what we were working on but we were starting a structural job. Donny Hein was the crane operator. I think his brother, Jim, was pushing... I can’t remember for sure but I think his brother was pushing the job. Kenny Zespi [sp?], he was an old timer and he was from Cross Plains, Wisconsin. He was always buying old rattle traps to get to work and back. He bought either a Plymouth or a Dodge. On their way down to Monroe to the job site, a gas tank strap broke and the gas tank was kind of hanging anti-gogglin’ [??] there. Rubbing on the road so that would be a no go. So when he got to the job site, because they weren’t that far I guess to go, as I recall. They decided that they would re-weld the gas strap. So they had Jimmy Hein... We put slings as sprutters on the back of Zespi’s car. And they raised it up. They could be welding and they could tip a little to make sure the gas was down at one end. That was in the days before they figured out that it’s the fumes that explode, not the liquid. But...anyway... They were welding that strap back together and they blew a hole in the gas tank with a torch. Now the gas is on fire. And Donny Hein—he and his old live boom crane—he picked the car up right away and he started going around in a circle. The only problem was--the gas that was spilling on the ground caught fire so there was a ring of fire. He was just keeping that car ahead of that ring of fire. It was quite something to behold. Let me tell you. LAUGHTER 23:36 [A minute ago, you talked about a particular part of a bar... Was it a slaver or...] Sleever bar. It’s actually a truck iron but... HE GOES AND GETS IT If you work structural, this way you have more lever than a 12 inch spud wrench--when you’ve got to pry, when you hold stuff on. So one end is for holding up on structural steel, the other is when you have pinch points, you can--one man can move some huge iron around with this sleever bar. Now this is... [Like a giant spud wrench...] Yeah, but here you can lift things, you can pry things apart or...so on and so forth. Now the average ironworker will alter this. They may heat it down here and put a bend in it so they have a rocker seat for the pry. But we always put...weld a large washer on here...and then we adapt it to our belt, our structural belt [i.e. the tool belt worn during structural steel  work] so you can wear it on your side. Slip it in and it’ll stay. It will be in like a holster. You need your hands when you’re kicking around. [You don’t want to trip over it...] No, no, no. It goes in your belt, about like this. You just pull it out of the shealt. I do not have—my old one I donated to the apprentices. Most of my tools...most of them have been donated. These are probably... various shapes and forms. Here’s an octagon one and... It’s the same way. This is the ones that will glide and adapt to their own personal length. [Cool.] I would assume that, you go over by the hall [Labor Temple], you could probably get someone to show you how they adapted theirs. When you’re up there with 5-6 ton beams, it’s a little hard to move them around with a little spud wrench. That’s just for holding up and bolting up. 28:50 [In your trade, with a mixed local, were there some kind of jobs that you liked better than others? Oh, certainly. It’s like... Anyone who has a job that’s multifaceted, you’re going to just gravitate toward things that interest you and you enjoy performing. So absolutely. And without further adieu, you’re going to get better at that. You’re going to get more proficient. Pretty soon, it’s word of mouth. You work for different contractors. They’re in business, they’re in business to make money. That’s what it’s all about. So they’re going to try their best to surround themselves with journeymen that they like and good crew members, but also... No matter what task they are assigned, they know they’re competent at it. They know they will do the job...which in turn turns into money. [Laughs] [Did you learn welding, connecting, rod busting...?] I did a lot of rods when I first started out because probably that is...from my point of view...probably the least popular part of the trade. It’s bull work. It’s hard. Hard physically. I did a lot of it. I always enjoyed the guys I worked with. You’re always partnered up on rods and stuff like that. You’re always working with at least one or two other guys. You realize that after your first structural job that, hey, this is a little bit easier. There’s—a hard day, you’re still getting short rests in between. When you’re waiting for the next piece iron to come up, there’s a short period that you’re waiting. Anticipating. Nice part of structural is that it’s too heavy to do by hand. Rods...rods are different. You move that, carry it, place it. Structural is different in that area. Of course you’re off the ground now so the rules change. You’ve got to know where you’re at. You’ve got to stay at ease. You certainly get around the iron much better if you’re comfortable. If you’re butt cheeks are all tightened up because you’re afraid of falling, it’s not a good situation. And if you keep at it, yeah, you acclimate and you get pretty confident. You always know where your feet are. The edge...you don’t even look. You know. You can feel it. Most guys are... You get your boots worn in, you can feel the flanges through your shoes. You know where you’re at. And you still perform your work. It’s the old story. It’s easy climbing up there. It’s doing the work after you get there is the hard part. And it’s pretty crude. 32:30 Iron... You get in there in a quarter of an inch on the level, that’s pretty tight stuff with that. Structural, where you go over to metal, and now you’re dealing with 64ths, 32nds... That’s finite work. Most of it is anodized so you can’t be scratching and scrubbing stuff. It’s real picky-picky stuff but a lot of fun to work with. When done correctly, it looks really nice when it’s done. 33:07 Welding. Welding really runs the gambit. There’s just... You’re always referred to rough welding. You’re welding down a bar joist on a job. You can get a little sloppy and nobody’s going to get hurt. Everything’s cool. If you’re welding moment connections [see definition  on-line] on a building, you’ve got to be a state licensed welder in order to be able to do that or supposedly licensed to do that type of work—because those are the fail points on a building. Many are magnifluxed or they’re x-rayed after you get done. Sometimes they’ll issue you a welding stamp so that when you’re done with your moment connection, you stamp your initials in it so there’s a record on the job of who welded it, how they welded it, under what conditions. You’ve got to slow them down, make sure you slag it and clean it out. Jitter bug it, whatever it takes. Then you go over and other parts of welding are--some of them are very ornate and ornamental. They are going to be exposed to the public, especially on an entry of a building, foyer in a building, something where it’s right out in front of you there. So you’re going to use a different technique and different type of electrode or process or to weld that. They’ll accept some...some are unacceptable so they have to be worked on again. 35:05 Every facet of the trade... When you get into it, there’s a tremendous amount of stuff to learn and salt it away. And again hands-on experience without a doubt the most important part of the job. [You used a couple of terms with the welding. One was to “slag in and jitter bug a beam.” Tell me what that means.] Well, if you’re using a gas shielded process where there is no slag, you’re in good shape. It’s called a mig. That’s great. But I’d say, even yet today, 90% of the welding that the ironworker performs in the field is done with the old fashioned electrode in a stinger. They are 11 inches long and the electrodes are coated with what I call a cake mix but it’s a combination of chemicals that cover the electrode. They’re all part of the process for that specific electrode. They are all numbered and all different sizes. So for instance, if you wanted a certain technique and you need 60-11 electrode. Another process, another type of welding done, you might want 70-18, low hydrogen electrode for. But anyway, in the process, while this thing is melting and you’re fusing the metal together, the chemical combination on the exterior of the electrode becomes slag... It burns up and its there to shield the molten metal from that electrode from the atmosphere. The atmosphere has a tremendous amount of contaminants in it. An open weld that’s unshielded, you’ll get all kinds of junk in there. You’ll get pit holes and so on and so forth. So when you’re done, obviously this is raw metal. Somewhere along the process, this is going to have to be painted. Many years ago, we used red lead paint, which is “really good” for you. [Laughs] But anyway, slagging is just taking a chip hammer or hammer and chisel or whatever and getting into that weld and knocking that slag off the weld to expose it. You wire brush it. Clean it up. And along come the painters, later on, and will apply some type of finish coat of something. On the welding. [And the jitter bug?] Jitter bug is an air-driven rattle... It’s like a chisel. It’s got a chisel blank in front of it. It’s a vibrator for air pressure so you can go along. It’s like a miniature jack hammer. [Cool.] 38:40 [You’ve mentioned contaminants in the air so then maybe it’s a good time to ask about... Weather. What are your experiences as an ironworker. You said you’re office is outdoors but...some of the... What can you say about that?] Well, I think most ironworkers will agree with me that only in Wisconsin...working iron...there are only 2-3 days that are perfect. The rest of the time it’s way too damn hot or its way too damn cold. But if you have a wife, and kids and a mortgage, you’ll find a special impetus in you to go to work every day. I’ve worked at -5 outside. Not too bad. Not pleasant but not that bad. The next day, the wind is blowing 15 miles an hour and its 10 above zero and you can’t make it. It’s exposure so you’ve got to call it a day. If you want to be an ironworker, you better get comfortable when the weather swings or  otherwise you’re going to starve to death. So you dress accordingly. Grouch and moan and things like that, complain, but you get through it just like the rest of the guys. That’s called making a living. 40:13 [What about accidents? Have you had some or did you call in any?] I don’t think you’re going to find too many ironworkers that haven’t been or received an injury on the job. Unfortunately I’ve fallen a couple of times and as you interview some of the old guys, you’re going to find that a few of those guys have fallen too. In my case, I got very fortunate. I was lucky both times that I fell. I had pretty decent landings. I’ve never broken a bone but I sure got scared the hell out of me a few times. [Did you fall on to a deck or something like that?] Well, once I fell into a pile of wash sand that the masons had and it just happened to be in the right specific spot on that job site. It cushioned my fall. It was still pretty solid. I knew I hit something. After the wind was knocked out of me I was ok. Another time up in Weyawauga’s old folks home, I lost a ladder. Just a stupid, stupid thing. I lost a ladder and down I went. And again, it was more embarrassing than it hurt. 41:40 [Did you climb columns] Yeah, before OSHA started, it was established in 1974. That date sticks in my mind. I might be off a year or two but I know it was right in there. Prior to OSHA, it was very common for us to ride the ball down for lunch and you’d ride the ball up after lunch. And you’d have 3, 4, 5 guys...and you’d interlock arms and hold on to each other and a load line. One foot was on the ball and the other foot was in the air, wrapped around another guy’s leg. You’d ride the ball up, you’d ride the ball down. And if the crane wasn’t there, many times you’d have 40 pounds of bolt, plus your tools... Yeah, you’d literally climb 1-2 stories up to the job site. Sometimes more... For the most part, one or two stories usually did it. [Did it take a while to get the hang of that?] Well, most ironworkers make a specific type of sole on their shoe. I happen to have a pair of soles right now. They’re made of... It’s hard, its solid. It’s wedged. You got your whole foot on a wedged sole. But they had the right compound that would bite into iron. If you place your weight on the soul, then you’d find that it would grip the iron. If your soles are too hard, they won’t bite—they just skid off the steel. So again, as you interview or meet ironworkers or watch them in the field. They used to wear high tops, red wings. Red wings, very popular with ironworkers. I’m sure a couple of... I’m sure the Shoe Box in Black Earth will attest to that. They sell many of them. The nice part about them, all you had to do is call them up and they’d... Steve Schmidt...yeah...they’ll be in the mail. Send me a check when you get them. [That’s pretty good.] Yeah, they’re $100 boots. If you order a couple of pair, but Steve is very well liked and very respected because you didn’t have to drive to Black Earth. Just give him a call and boom, two days later, you’d have ‘em. [I worked with some ironworkers at the Smithsonian and I tried climbing columns with sneakers on I tried climbing...I couldn’t.] And then you saw how they were doing it. [Well, yeah. It’s like...Just like cat.] Well, if you swing your butt... If you watched them, all that weight is going on the sole in the web. So there’s your bite. So as you swing, up you go. Swing up and go... And after a while, you get where most people don’t even see that accent. But yeah, it’s all in the gripe, if you bite. That’s why if you have pocks in the iron, you can’t. But if you’ve got just red leaded iron or raw iron, good bite. And then it’s just upper body strength. You’re pulling a load, especially if you’ve put about 60 pounds of tools on. LAUGHTER  45:55 [Tool belt is important.] Oh yeah. [Do people make them or modify them at all?] Oh yeah. There’s a lot of belts... HE GETS ONE Here’s the only one I got left around here. I gave all my... This is the old side lanyard. This is what they call a bridge belt. You got your tools down and you’re above a ladder. If you fall or that, all you have to do...it’s like a parachute lanyard. Just pull on that... These are made by Klein. As you can see, the mechanism opens right up. So you loose, otherwise, you’d drown for sure. And again, this affectionately became known as a bridge belt bridge and it’s out. And there’s no buckle. HE DEMONSTRATES And here’s the adjustable. And before OSHA, this is where our 6 foot lanyard would go through the belt. They’re all make, model and serial number, each one is an individual belt. That’s the story and then there’s just a couple bolt bags on there now. Like I said, you’ll have to go to the hall if you want to photograph tools. I’m sure they’d be more than happy for you to come in there. 47:50 [Speaking of bridges, did you ever work on a rivet gang or...one of those?] I only worked on one rivet. They were pretty much out of the business by the time I come in. We went down to Rockford, Illinois, to do a small job at their plant. Since it was Rockford Bolt Company. The old guy that owned it, he had thousands of rivets that were never sold. So he decided that he would use some of those rivets. That was the only rivet job I ever worked on.. That’s before I became a blacksmith when I learned my heats. There’s a heat chart there on the... They are heated to a certain color. I can’t even remember. We had an old guy from Janesville that was the heater. He was heating and throwing. Boy, it’s been so long ago I can’t remember. [So that went over the trade at...?] Oh yeah. I want to say that the railroads...were still riveting at the end of the 60s. I’m fairly sure that most railroad bridges were still being riveted. Then one guy would have the rivet gun... They used tongs to put the rivet in the hole...air operated pneumatic rivet gun. You’d come up on the head. The other guy on the other side would have what they called a horse cock. He would back her...just pull the trigger and run and you might roll the gun so you get a nice round head. That’s all I can... I was the only one... I took a lot of rivets out... [laughs] 50:20 [When I saw you up on the square, we talked very briefly about Max and Kenny...] Elliot Funmaker. He was an ironworker too. He just got into... I just heard abut him on the news. Something about Elliot... Ho-Chunk Board or something like that. I believe Kenny is his dad. [I’m going to have to talk to him because he said a lot of his brothers are singers.] Yeah, they are performers in... [I’m going to work with him in mid-August at a festival in Dodgeville.] Great, great. [What can you tell me about... I think you said his dad was real quiet and Kenny...] Max was very quiet. Maybe two words a day, that would be a conversation. Kenny, you could get around and talk to Kenny quite a bit as I recall. [So did you work on some jobs with those guys?] Oh... The only thing I can remember... He worked on the McGregor, Iowa, rehab on the bridge down there, the box girder bridge, for American Bridge. If memory serves, I believe one of his duties was sharpening drills and he was pretty good at that. The only other one was we were doing a grocery store on the north side of Madison (USED TO BE EAGLES, THEN KOHLS NOW JUNGS). That was a structural job. Those are the only two times that I... Ladish Malt, on the make over down there... He wasn’t in the same crew that I was in... 52:45 [Let me ask about the rivalries with the other trades. What is the ironworkers sense of themselves in relation to the other trades and are there rivalries?] Well most of the tradesmen I  know...and it’s done in a friendly way... We kid with other trades. That’s why we call electricians “sparkies” and stuff like that. Brickies... But it’s usually the person. Once you humanize a person, no matter what they do. I feel as though once you humanize someone, you have a much better relationship with them. You start doing things out of spite, that doesn’t get you anywhere. Maybe short term but not long term. The one thing, I think historically, is that carpenters seem to think... As the saying goes, “There ain’t a trade out there that a carpenter doesn’t like.” Ok? To put it in a friendly way. They’ll encroach on your purview of work. Damn it – we have families to support and feed too. If we don’t have work, that’s pretty hard to do. Yeah, you get a little sharp with them when you find out that they’ve... It’s like... A carpenter... There ain’t one of ‘em that doesn’t have a wood puddler for concrete in their toolbox. So what does that tell you if you’re a cement finisher? I guess...that’s about all I want to say about that I think. 54:53 [You mentioned working for other locals... Have you boomed out much?] Well, during times of strikes. I was on the CAT plant, Caterpillar Plant, in Peoria during a strike. Some of us went over to Battle Creek Michigan on a nuclear plant during another strike. Worked in McHenry Illinois out of Local 498, which is Rockford. But most of the guys were from Local 1 out of Chicago. I worked down there on a hospital job with them. I worked out by O’Hare field a few times through Local 63. I got to know, like I say, some of the officials and that of Local 63. That certainly served me well. 512, Twin Cities because they border our local. Local 8 is Milwaukee. Local 90...Local 89, Davenport, Iowa, er no, Cedar Rapids. Anytime you get over by the river, most of those locals are going to be a little injection of both locals. And you get to know them. They live across the river there... [laughs]. You get places where you might get a job on the river that LaCrosse guys are all busy, all working. You need some men. You’re sitting in Madison... Do I want to drive 100 miles...? Nobody wants to fill the spot. The business manager may call Cedar Rapids. Talk to the business manager. “I hear you have guys out of work, on the bench., we’ve got a job over...” So that’s very common, very common. 57:00 [Some say ironworkers have a reputation that they like to drink?] Oh, I don’t know...I don’t know. Ya know... Personally, I don’t think we’re better at it or worse at it than some of the other trades. Painters like to drink. LAUGHTER I know that for a fact. So yeah, you can always point fingers but if guys like a beer, they like a beer. Yeah... It’s the nectar of the gods... 57:55 [What about topping out or anything when you finished a job... Can you talk about ceremonies or customs you might...] Well, on larger projects...yeah. Up on the paper mills up north, they make a real...especially if it’s big. The business school, when they finished that at the UW. Oh my... We were on GEF 1 uptown. They had a little deal, you go in there. But a lot of times they’ll have a leave-out beam or whatever that they’ll set to top it up. Historically, it’s the upper most member which doesn’t always happen because of the way things are constructed and that. But no matter how big the job or how small, there are usually... If it’s just a whoop-de-do and we’re done and whatever, that’s one thing. But an American flag is pretty prevalent on the job. We usually keep a couple of banners at the hall that we can use at topping out ceremonies. [What’s on the banners?] Just our local and ironworkers and that for the most part. But the other thing is, a lot of times we’ll sign the beam while we’re putting it in... Or the uppermost structural unit, pass it around. Operators, everybody gets on that. It’s an old... I think the  Druids are part of that or maybe the Norwegians...for many different reasons. 59:36 [I noticed that you have a miniature crane...] Yeah, well, that’s what happens when you get old and you have all that time... You start dabbling. Ever since I came into the trade, I’ve been fascinated with lattice boom cranes. Unfortunately, they’re beginning to be a thing of the past but, yeah... You listen to the old timers talk about different makes and machines and things like that. If you look out...if you work with them...it’s pretty hard not get to like cranes because they’re doing all the heavy stuff. And then again, I always look at how things were designed, structurally and engineering-wise, on the work. So, yeah. I dabble with that. I have one down here. HE GETS IT CAN’T HEAR WHAT’S BEING SAID, IN ANOTHER ROOM IN THE GARAGE MENTIONS THE “OLD MAN” AND THE “WHIP LINE” 01:02:30 Anyway, its just a little pastime or hobby of mine. I have a wood one up there that I did out of plastic. I got to crawler up there yet. [That’s cool.] People get a kick out of them. 01:02:50 [Do guys make miniatures of equipment or do you ever set up a mini...?] I don’t know of any other guy in the local that does that. I’m not saying there aren’t any. I just... Like I say, when you get older and you have more time on your hands, you can devote time to doing whatever you like. We used to have... Bill Maben... Oh no... But that guy was a fantastic wood carver. It would blow your mind to see what that man could do with a piece of wood. And I want to say his name was Grey. He was an operator. Pappy Brown from Pardeeville. He was a rigger. He was a rigger’s rigger. Unbelievable what he could do with those rope lines and stuff, hooking stuff up. And these are the guys you learn from. If you take the time... 01:03:52 [So rigging would be like setting up...?] Yeah, fixing lines. Well, you’re going to pick some. Every job ain’t the same. You’ll find the ironworkers, like Reynold’s Crane Service. They’re moving. And industrial moving. Those ironworkers are there all the time – full time. And they’re just really gifted at rigging. But that’s a whole...that’s a whole different part of our occupation too. It is all parts and that’s just one. Crane man... [Some of that has to carry over on working on sailing ships.] Yup, ships, sailing ships. Yes, many ironworkers came from... Because they had two things going. They could rig and they could get around tight. Take some of those old masted and schooners boy, you’re up off the ground. [And you’re moving.] And you’re moving and you’ve got to be constantly changing lines. I mean... They’re in salt water. They’re taking a beaten. They couldn’t have had a long life to ‘em. So they’re continually... Well, in the navy. Chief Bosun Mate. It’s amazing what those guys... A couple of them out in Truax Field. I don’t know if that’s a Seabee, flying or what’s out there flying. I wanted to tie up some boat bumpers. Have you ever seen those? [Oh, yes. Millers they call them.] Yeah. Yeah. And those guys... I didn’t know how to get started. That was my problem. I called out there... “Guys come out...” They made photocopies on the machine and everything. They were great guys. [So do you still know a lot of knots and so forth?] Oh yes. If you’re at the hall in their office, that knot board... LAUGHS [You made that.] Yeah. [Oh cool. My wife does a lot of work with...] Macrame. [...with commercial fishermen over the years. Some with coast guard people too. She’s looked into all kinds of knot work that fishermen have done. Folds or just ties.] There’s a book, I want to say it’s a UW book... 2001 knots. [Yeah, I’ve seen that...] It takes you a little while. Once you get into it and start it, it’s a lot easier.  01:06: [Some people do ‘em for tool handles, to just get a grip.] Oh yeah, its all about the application. Absolutely. A lot of times we’re putting something on the trailer and we have to latch on that. It all comes back. 01:07:20 [So at what point did you move out of the field into the apprenticeship?] We were just part time coordinators early on. And—WE TAKE A BREAK AND THEN COME BACK.] 01:07:40 The apprenticeship committee is made up of equal number of contractors and journeyman. Your usual response is, “What the hell do I know about being a coordinator...I’m an ironworker.” And they said, “Well, we’ve been observing you and all that... We want you to at least come in for an interview.” So I went in. It was only two days a week when I first started. I was working for Kupfer and I talked to the field superintendent, Rodney, and he said they’d work around that. I did that for probably two years or better. I was doing both work and that. We lost our instructor – he quit. And Scotty passed away from cancer. He was the instructor for many years, in the 60s...and 70s even. But then we had working with the tech school system in the state. They used to call it circuit instructors. That’s where Madison handled all the paperwork for their pay and benefits. And the other tech school areas, you know, they signed an agreement and they’d pay in but Madison would do the heavy lifting as far as the paperwork and that. And then that way you’d have a full load as an instructor. You’d have to travel to the students, thee students would not come to you. You were on the road most every day of the week. And the load was always changing because of the areas. You may teach in Chippewa Falls or somewhere up there for a couple of years. Then that would dry up but then they’d be adding ironworkers in Janesville or whatever. So I couldn’t find an instructor. I got a couple but after about two classes, they realized they were way in over their hands. They were like, “what’s prep?” LAUGHS And you know, these are four hour classes. This isn’t like a half hour here and you’re out of there... And so... They kept after me but finally, I said, “I can’t run the dang thing, and still work.” It’s just... Well, just give it a try. I don’t know... 2-3 months, I was in Wausau, Wisconsin Rapids, Stevens Point, Madison and LaCrosse. Finally I said, it ain’t going to happen. So what if we up your hours and... Well, okay. We’ll try that. So eventually, I worked 4 days a week as a coordinator. I could double up on some of the stuff because now I had one-on-one contact with the apprentices as well as instructing. I stayed instructing for 18 years. But if I had a couple of slack days or whatever, and there was a call in the hall... They shipped the stone in for the Kohl’s Center, the big W. I worked for International Erectors a few times so they requested me to weld that in place up there when they set it. That was a better part of a day so I was still on a regular basis but I was still working in the field. [So you were one of the first guys who became more or less full time apprenticeship?] Yes, that was, I was the first full time. Eventually it was five. As I got older and...LAUGHS They just put me on. 01:12:38 [What years did you do it for?] December 1979 was when I came on board and I retired in 2002. [You mentioned a guy named Scottie. What was his last name?] Seth Scott was the instructor back then. Then Bert Bitters was full time, working as the next instructor. [This is probably enough...we’ve gone on for about an hour and a quarter...]  01:13:15 [I can play some back to you and maybe make some notes and pictures, especially of these cranes and what you’re working on out here.] Well, these...I volunteer. I do a lot of custom garden work too. People over the years... Now that I’m retired, as soon as your... I’ve been out here 42 years now. And the farmers around here, their tractor, mold boards on their plows and stuff, they know I’m a welder. They’ve become very friendly. [A “runaway” every once in a awhile?] LAUGHS Yeah, well if you’re in rocks and stuff like that, it’s pretty easy to bust up a mold board and a price of a mold board is...so...yeah... I’ve done quite a bit of that. Or machinery breaks down. I do that for them. Pretty much on a free basis. Good neighbor policy. And then about ...the late 80s. We started with the light show up at Warner Park on the northside [of Madison]. I don’t know if you’re familiar with that or not. [I’ve been there many times.] Those we tried to do 3 dimensional and put a lot of work into it. We’d use apprentice classes to be involved with that...which is good. It’s a learning thing and... Math problems to work out. So we made just about everything up there, 3 dimensional. Then all of a sudden, everyone got their butt up in a tail spin and they discontinued it. Then next regime came in and they were lukewarm about trying to get something started again. The contractors were stepping up and said, “Yeah, that was... We got a lot of PR out of that. It was good for our industry.” So...for about 2-3 years, they rented. Out of Upper New York, someplace where they made these displays. They were renters and the bill was in the 10s of $1,000s of dollars. And why don’t you guys...wait... They’re not even yours. You’re just renting them. They’re done. And they decided...well...yeah... So they got rid of the rental but they bought two to keep. Ever since then...and then they approached me and they forgot...that I was involved with the old one. They talked to Freddie Brown, the electrician instructor... And Fred said, “Yeah...through the classes...Ed set these things up. They’re great. What the hell. All we got to pay for is the material.” So the got ahold of me and talked me about the possibilities. And I said, “Tell you what. You buy the material. Tell me what you want. I’m retired, I have time. I can make time. I’ll just make them up for you. Just come and get them.” And they were like, “Hey, great! What a deal.” So the last 5-6 years, I’ve been... These are the last two...seven I’ve made this year. I did the Monona [Terrace] Frank Lloyd Wright building. I did a castle. I’ve got them on the clip board up there. I did a Snoopy bi-plane. Similar in size, 20-25 feet. So these will last too unless they come up with another drawing. You know. I feel like I’m giving back something to the community. Am I helping feed the poop and starving? No, they’ve got food banks. What talent do I have that I can...? So that’s when I figured... And my mother was in an assisted living place before she passed away and I know that she looked forward... Every winter they’d take a bus and go see these displays. All the elderly just loved it. Little kids... It’s not that I don’t care about the regular people but... They’re on their own. But the old and the young, well, this is something I can give back to them. Good for me and good for them. So it works really well. But... I have people... 1:18:43 Our mill race out there. It just finished its drying. I do a lot of...plant stands, garden... Anything that has to do with flowers and gardening. I’m always looking for that. Row markers, tools, you name it. [Well, I think that’s great. I’ve got some great stuff here.]
RCAemployee;Conrad Haber;[START OF TRANSCRIPT] [0:00:08] Conrad Haber: My name is Conrad Haber and I started as a Systems Engineer here June 23rd, 1969. I worked with at the time it was Government Communications Systems Division, GCSD. The reason for coming here was because of all the space work that RCA had done with the ranger series, and all the moon pictures and photographic works. Once Apollo started up, this was the place to come and work. I made sure I got down here, and came in on the rotational program. And ended up getting an assignment up with Ed Nossen, up in the communications systems area. Ed was doing a lot of the Apollo work. I was in the perfect place at the right time to get in on that. Okay. Let’s talk about your first assignment. Right. You know, if you had mentors, what your impressions were, why you came to RCA? Yeah, I think the primary reason for coming was the space race was at its height, and as a technical person, I mean that was the place to be. I looked at what was going on, couldn’t get into NASA. They weren’t hiring. I decided the next best place was to come to a company that was providing all the hardware for the space effort. That was RCA, was a significant supplier. I came here and the group was phenomenal. The people here... Ed Nossen who was I ended up working for, who did a lot of work on coming up with some very creative solutions to solve navigation problems, and communication problems on the space program. In particular, between Apollo and LEM, and other things. I had people like John Allen and Carl Solomon to work with. Who were senior engineers and were exceptional people in terms of bringing along a young engineer, and inviting me to meetings. Just watching how these people think and solve problems was an incredible learning experience. It’s one thing to read about problem solutions in text books, but another thing to sit next to some really experienced people and watch how they frame a problem. Things they pay attention to. Things they don’t pay attention to as an engineer, and understand how to really solve the key parts of the problem, and come up with a solution rather quickly that’s effective enough to really get the design going. That you can’t learn in a book. These guys were great [0:00:53] Jim: [0:00:57] Conrad Haber: [0:00:57] Jim: [0:01:05] Conrad Haber: [0:02:42] Jim: [0:02:44] Conrad Haber: at doing it. I was very fortunate to be around three or four exceptional people, and I learned as much as I could from them. How did they treat you? It was interesting, I mean I felt rather intimidated. As a student, you know, I had all this knowledge in my head, and I thought it was important to remember equations and all the things I had learned. I figured these guys weren’t even going to recognize me, but they treated me as a peer. They explained things to me. No question was too stupid to ask. Slowly I became comfortable with saying, “I don’t understand that. Could you explain that a little bit more?” There was nothing I asked that they wouldn’t answer. If they couldn’t answer it or if they did answer it they would give me some references where to go and look further. This was pre-internet. So you just didn’t go Google this stuff and I mean you had to go to the library and do some research to look this stuff up. Having somebody there who could actually explain things to you was way more valuable than it is in these days when you can go Google and tap into experts who have written things, and different documents. Via your iPads, and all this stuff. It’s a different world back then. What was your contribution? I thought I wasn’t really going to have much of a contribution being so young. I think I had just learned all this stuff, but the interesting thing was something that turned out to be very significant for them. Was I would check all the calculations on the radio communication links from...in space. So RCA built a LEM, not a LEM, but the Lunar Rover. Which had a lot of the video transmitter and would send pictures directly back to Earth. Okay. There as a transmitter and a RF link, and somebody analyzed how much powder was necessary to get a good signal quality on the ground. This was pre-calculator. Everything was done in slide rules. Everybody was using slide rules to do these calculations. I looked at the documents and went through them. I was trying to understand how you do these calculations with very complex wave forms there. I did the math and looked like I found a mistake. I checked it ten times, and it looked like a mistake. It looked like they weren’t transmitting enough power to get the picture quality on the ground. I went to Frank Ortson, he was one of the guys that was working with. I got his attention and said, “Hey Frank, it looks like you guys aren’t transmitting enough power.” He says, “Yeah, okay, okay. I’ll check it out. I’ll check it out.” Well about two days later he called me in, and he was all happy. He said, “You know, there was a mistake. It was four watts too low.” He said, “And that would have degraded [0:03:46] Jim: [0:03:48] Conrad Haber:  [0:05:42] Jim: [0:05:45] Conrad Haber: the picture quality on the ground.” He says, “Which would have been a disaster, because that stuff was getting piped all over the world from the moon.” Actually I found that problem (laughter). I was pretty proud of that, and that was one of the things I did. I wasn’t here even a year when I found that out. It was pretty cool. Getting some congrats from some of these really high powered guys that I had a lot of respect for was an incredible experience. Yeah, I really enjoyed it. Did you do any calculations the same way they did? Well I just... They just put... Yeah, they had equation and they said, “Here’s the equation that defines the laws. If you put in this power it works out.” Like I said, my slide rule is the only you can do it. There are no calculators. Nobody had any. There was zero calculators. That technology was not invented yet. You go through with the slide, if you’re familiar with slide rules I’m sure. Most people aren’t. I mean you have to take care of decimal places in your head, and all that has to be done in your head as you move the slide. There’s a lot of calculations. It’s very easy to make a mistake. I checked it, like I said, ten times, and it was off. It was wrong. I was... It was a big deal to them and then it became a big deal to me. It was a very good experience. Talking to some of the other people involved with Apollo there is a story developing about the rendezvous radar, and maybe it was either less than adequate or maybe it needed a backup. Do you have anything you can add to that? Yeah. The rendezvous radar was critical, because what the radar permitted was when the LEM took off from the lunar surface after landing it had to re-rendezvous with the command service module. A command module which was... Which was orbiting...orbiting the moon. The primary way that the LEM could find these space craft was to use the rendezvous radar, but NASA’s design philosophy was that any systems that are critical to life support, like life support itself or radar like this. Because if those guys couldn’t find the command module to get back, they were done. They were dead. They don’t have one system. They always had two systems at least, backup. While the rendezvous radar was the primary system, they ended up using the ranging system that Ed Nossen developed, we developed here in Camden. Ed was the one to use the communication radios as a way to get range and range read, and sort of help you steer and find the command module if the LEM rendezvous radar was not working. That, Ed’s system got high priority. It had to be working [0:06:28] Jim: [0:06:45] Conrad Haber:  [0:08:51] Jim: [0:08:54] Conrad Haber: [0:08:54] Jim: [0:09:00] Conrad Haber: and on every launch to make sure if that radar failed, we had a backup. In fact that system works so well that when we did the Apollo Soyuz transfer experiment where the Apollo spacecraft and the Soyuz spacecraft actually docked together back I think in ’75 or so in orbit The Russians used our ranging system to find the docking module. Which was pretty cool. We gave them the schematics and stuff, and of course you have to build a transponder. They don’t have any semi-conductors, they only had tubes. We actually built it for them and got it installed on Soyuz. Which was really cool. That was the primary system for doing the rendezvous, and it worked really well. They docked up, and it was cool. We’re all familiar with Apollo 13. Mm-hm. It sounds to me that you may have actually experienced that time? Yeah. This was part of the learning process of being part of what was going on, and sitting in the room and listening to all the real movers and shakers, solve problems. Thirteen, we built the command radios. All the command radios for the 13 module. For all of the Apollo modules. What happened was we got a call from NASA, and they said, “Hey, have you guys ever figured out what would happen to the radios if we powered them down, and they had condensing water on them? Would they power up and operate again?” We said, “What?” (laughter) They said, “For real.” They next thing I knew there was a phone call, a conference call, all the guys in the room. I snuck in the door and sat in the back of the room and watched this thing unfold. Basically what they were described the problem and they asked us, “We got to power down the command module. Of course when we do that with the water vapor in the air it’s going to condense out. When we fire up, your radio has got to work, or we can’t communicate with these guys. Have you ever tested it that way?” “No.” “We need you test it.” Guys went off and took them in environmental lab, you know, put them in with the humidity. Got them condensing in moisture. I wasn’t doing any of this. I was just watching this unfold. It was incredible. Yeah, they worked. The guys got back, we closed with NASA. There was a lot of fury. We were working like through the night. Just running on this thing 24-7 to get this question answered. It was an amazing time. Our radios, we said they would work, and they worked when the guys powered up that command module, those radios were on. They had grounds... and they got comms with CAPCON on the ground. Worked really good. Good stuff. I didn’t  [0:10:55] Jim: [0:11:03] Conrad Haber: design any of those. I can’t take any credit for all of that, but it was great being a technical person. Just being around guys who did, and watching this whole thing unfold. Now, how does your career get from there to where you are now as a Staff Systems Engineer? I think I... The funny thing about engineering is that technology changes rapidly, and as we all know even faster. It’s geometric with time. The thing that is invariant with time are the underlying physical principals under which devices work. The approach to solving problems which you can’t learn in a book, and those lessons once you learn them will really, really transfer nicely to the newer technologies as they come through. The terminology changes, the technology changes, but at the heart of all of this are the same physical principals. When you have problems, the way you solve these problems are the same as they are back then. Everything I was fortunate enough to learn in school and from the people I work with, and have mentored me here, has transferred over the 46 years to now. I can still sit in a room with guys who are half my age and we can solve problems together. I can participate, and get solutions. That’s an incredible feeling to be able to do that. Even though when I came into work here, we were transitioning from tubes to semiconductors and as everybody knows now, most people don’t even know what a transistor is anymore. I mean, it’s just flat packs and integrated circuits, and the technology is so far advanced from anything we could have imagined back then. The physics is the same. The math is the same. How you solve a problem is pretty much the same. Those are the things I think I’ve really valued having learned here in my early part of my career. Are you now mentoring engineers? Yes. As many as I can. The young folks in here, and I just give them... I just dump everything on them. I mean, I give them what I got. As much as they can stand. Because I’m not going to be here very much longer, and some guys check out early other guys can take it in. The thing that’s really great about a lot of the young folks that come in now, is which I didn’t have, they’ll go off. You know, I’ll give them a dump on some RF stuff and how you solve a problem in communications. They’ll take notes, and they’ll go off, look at the words, things they don’t understand they go on Google. Keyword searches. They’ll get articles, they’ll read them. In one night they can do all this. They come back to me with follow up questions the next day, and they say, “Hey, I read this paper. I read this.” [0:12:41] Jim: [0:12:44] Conrad Haber:  [0:13:55] Jim: [0:14:00] Conrad Haber: In ’69, when I came here, that would have taken weeks to research. They’re real fast. I can get to a lot of guys. In fact, I’ve got three guys that I’m working with. They’re very bright and very interested, and as long as you have the interest you can take advantage of the fabulous technologies out there now to learn things. I’m excited about that. Let’s talk about your RCA co-workers. It was intimidating. Guys like Ed Nossen who were, you know, had 40 patents, and just about a genius in terms of doing things, but still would take the time to interact with me. Look at my stuff and he wasn’t a very talkative person, but he would pay attention and give me some guidance. There were guys here like other people, like Jim Feller, who had not only great technical capabilities but had photographic memories. They could remember every detail about everything they’ve ever seen. They were phenomenal people working and interacting with them as well. There were some very talented designers here who were very capable of using the existing technology to build circuits and radios that worked phenomenally. Like Sam Pietrofitta who was one who worked on the command module radio. That was before I came here back in the late ‘60s. I came in ’69, but I had a chance to work with Sam a lot on some other RF programs after that. We had a mix of what I call the very conceptual people. Who could deal with the mathematics and the concepts, and we had some very, very technologists who could build things. Getting those groups together was very powerful. We had talented people in every one of those groups. Made some fantastic products, and responded to problems very quickly. What about your supervisors? Did they value your work? Yeah for the most part they did. I noticed no one ever discouraged me. No one... Everyone took the time to look at what I did. A lot of times when I saw how my task fit into what was going on in the program, it really wasn’t significant. A lot of what they did was, but they looked at it as a learning experience for me, on something to learn. No one ever said... No one ever dismissed anything as being trivial, not correct, or no one made me feel inadequate in any way. We’re always encouraged to learn more and to do things. Then only when I could see what happened at the end, I could say, “Gee, that piece of work wasn’t going to make it anywhere.” I wouldn’t have known it from when I got reviewed to the... Did you feel that RCA valued your work? [0:15:29] Jim: [0:15:35] Conrad Haber: [0:16:20] Jim:  [0:16:22] Conrad Haber: [0:16:59] Jim: [0:17:05] Conrad Haber: Yes. This place was a technical company, and it was run by engineers. Engineering talent, technical skills were valued very highly. That may have been the demise of this place in terms of its business modeling, and being able to be competitive into the future. As an engineer, this was a phenomenal place to work back then. We were working on programs critical to the space race, the defense of the country, with really confident people, and we had good contracts. We had the funding here to do things and we did them. Learned a lot. We heard from a lot of people a term, “the RCA family.” What’s that mean to you? I’ve never worked anyplace else. I came here for about five years. I wanted to get out of school, get some experience, and move on. Get to another environment. I’m still here. It’s not RCA anymore. It’s changing, it’s changing. There’s still remnants of the culture back then. When I came here, this wasn’t a job. This was a career. The people that you interacted with, it wasn’t a sterile interaction. It was an interaction that was almost like a family. I mean you had people who were concerned about how you were feeling. How you’re growing technically, and how you were supporting the overall organization. There was a lot of concern about that here, and they were concerned about bringing people in. People took care of people. Even people who were key contributors and for some reason they were a little off their game, these people are part of the family and were assigned places where they could still produce. Still be productive and still come to work. I think in a modern company that was a little more Draconian, those people might have been laid off, discharged. You know, “What have you done for me lately?” Kind of attitude. There was not much of that back then. When you did something significant and there were people who did very significant things in this company, the family took care of you. Because you had made a key contribution, and you were a valuable person. Yeah maybe you changed now, you’re a little different in the kind of things you can do, but we owe you. You’re part of this family. We owe you. We’re going to find a place here where you can still be productive. I don’t see that in companies now. I don’t see that attitude towards people anymore. It’s more, “Yeah, you did that great thing but you got paid for it, and now what are you doing for me?” That wasn’t the way it was. It was truly like a family. Like you treat your siblings and your parents. Through good times and bad, that was your family, and you stuck together. That really was how it was here.  [0:19:05] [0:19:24] Jim: [0:19:27] Conrad Haber: [0:19:29] Jim: [0:19:35] Conrad Haber: Therefore, instead of staying here for five years, I’m here for most of my career. Or all my career. For that reason. I mean that’s a layer that makes it really nice to come to work. You have that relationship with the people, technical challenge, and get paid for it. I mean, it doesn’t get much better than that, I don’t think. What about outside of work? Oh. How do you mean? Would I... Did you associate with any of your co-workers outside of work? Yeah. Engineers, there’s a wide spectrum of personalities. Engineering, its traditional engineering personality, very introverted, quiet, kind of nerdy. We had those kind of guys, and I was sort of like that back in the beginning of my career. I mean, that’s sort of the kind of folks that got attracted to engineer school. There were other people here who had totally different personalities. Like John Allen was somebody that I was fortunate enough to work with who turned out to be... Was a senior scientist here at the end of his career in Camden. He was in that systems group with me. John was an excellent engineer, a very vigorous guy, he had a Christmas party every year. Which he invited me and my wife to the first time we were here. It was incredible. I mean, I work with these people, now I’m going to be invited to this social event. Not only was John there, but all the people that I worked with were there. I saw everybody in a totally different venue. This was a “have fun” kind of environment. It wasn’t technical. People were bringing in dishes they had made, and this happened every year. Every year that John was working here, and even after he left until he passed away. We went to the party every year with him. My wife and I, we went to every party. Those kinds of things were really special. Of course, travelling with these guys on trips. When we would go on these trips they’d bring me along just to observe and see how things were going. Incredible experience watching how these people... Just the discussions. We’d talk about world affairs. These were multifaceted, really rich people from a human standpoint. They had a lot of facets and personality and being exposed to that was a great experience. I had a lot of that. These guys were great. That was a great... That’s part of the family thing. Where you get to see all the facets of somebody and you can have a much better relationship with them, and when you know who they are.  [0:21:26] Jim: [0:21:36] Conrad Haber: Yeah, we also heard from people about lunch hour and Christmas Eve, and things like that. (Laughter) Yeah. Christmas Eve here was a day you wanted to come into work, but you didn’t do any work. There were parties. People would have celebrations. John Allen, from the systems group, every Christmas Eve he would have a poetry reading session in the conference room. Where he would start reading... I forget it was somebody from... I forget now... something about the north country and being in the Arctic...He would read these poems, and ordinarily there would be soda and food and snacks. We’d be going on doing that. There was a lot of discussions and having a good time. Every Christmas Eve that’s how it went. We worked for a couple of hours and spent the rest of the day there with the rest of the family so to speak, having a good time. We’ve also heard from people about RCA’s influence on South Jersey. Do you have anything to say about that? Well, I think RCA was... RCA and Campbell’s Soup were South Jersey. I mean everybody in this area that I ever met either worked at one of those two places or knew somebody who did, or had a family member that was here. When both plants were here, there were a lot of restaurants and support places, and stores, Camden changed a lot since then, that supported all the people here. There was a lot of business that we provided them. Anytime people asked me where I worked, of course I’d say RCA, and they’d know exactly where and “Who you worked with?” You know that kind of discussion. You know they either knew somebody in here, had worked here themselves, or had a family member that did. It was... just seemed like South Jersey was either Campbell’s or RCA. I was surprised. I came from New York City when I went to school and came down here in Southern New Jersey. I knew nothing about, but it was pretty clear that those were the two big companies. Alright so, how would you sum up your time here at RCA, your career? How would you sum that up? I would say it was a great personal experience. In terms of meeting some incredibly fine people. It was an intellectually stimulating and rewarding experience, and I got a chance to really grow technically. More importantly work on some programs that really had an impact on the world. Space and some of the other areas I worked on in the classified arena. Which I got a chance to see what the impact of those was. That is very fulfilling. It was very fulfilling to me. I’m still working now. It’s been 46 years, and I wouldn’t be doing that if I didn’t still feel it was something really special. I’m going to have to [0:22:25] Jim: [0:22:35] Conrad Haber: [0:23:35] Jim: [0:23:45] Conrad Haber:  [0:24:53] Jim: [0:24:57] Conrad Haber: [0:24:57] Jim: [0:25:03] Conrad Haber: [END OF TRANSCRIPT] change that now, but I look back and it was a great ride. I really, really enjoyed, and I hope that the engineers that start now and I know that corporate environment's changed, there are still a lot of problems to solve out there. I hope they end up with the same experience that I had, because I couldn’t define it in a better way. Well, I know you to be one of the best systems engineers I’ve ever encountered. Thanks Jim. I hope your time here isn’t too short, yet, because you are critically needed about your job. Yeah I enjoy it. It’s good. The young people are incredible. These young folks coming out of college now are very talented guys. That’s encouraging, and it’s great working with them.
RCAemployee;Chip McGrogan;[START OF TRANSCRIPT] [0:07.5] McGrogan: I’m Chip McGrogan. I started in RCA in 1957 on the graduate study program. I was out of Drexel, graduated class of 57, second in my class. Drexel, of course, was a co-op school. It was about the only way I could really get to college. So after five years, I had five years of education that included two years of practical work experience. The last two years of co-op experience was at Boroughs where I worked as essentially the personal technician of a real transistor expert. That was before the transistor was widely known. That experience paid off when I got... I was looking for a place to go to graduate school. I want to take an assistantship and teach and make very little money but yet a master’s degree. And then RCA came along with a graduate study program which was new in 1957. It essentially offered you essentially a free tuition and books for two years into University of Pennsylvania, which was one of my favorite schools. And we got paid for essentially 80% of our time. They paid us like a dollar an hour for the time we’re in school. They paid us a regular salary for the rest of the time and that was after two years we'd have a master’s degree and two more years of work experience, so that really paid off and that was the deciding factor that brought me to RCA. I interviewed a number of places at RCA including they called the Home Instrument Division which is where these guys were breaking their neck and working all night to develop color TV. I was very impressed by that but I interviewed in Advanced Technology Labs in Camden which were doing somewhat the same kind of work I was doing as a co-op and met several people there. When I was doing co-op work, I picked up a book, the only book that existed on transistor electronics. It turned out the authors were all from RCA. I met some of them during my interview time. They hired me on the spot. I never had to co-op. I never had to basically rotate to another assignment. They wanted me there. So I spent the first few years of my career working with the... essentially, was the beginning of the transistor age taking all the old vacuum tube circuits and learning how to transistorize them, write a patent. I think I ended up in the first couple of years with about 13 patents doing that, which I don’t think they were ever worth anything but it looked good on a resume. And I worked in that. I did some work in Advanced Technology on which was called Neural Networks which were simulations of how the brain works with essentially threshold type logic. I wrote a paper on that, submitted it to National Electronics Conference in, I think, 1960. I won first prize for the best paper of the conference, $500 prize which that time was like a month's salary. It was the beginning of my work in Advanced Technology area but a few years into that, a job was awarded to the Advanced Technology labs which was a product development thing which was strange but it seemed the way the government wanted to do business. It was to develop a secured IFF, Identification Friend or Foe system that turned out to be the first application of integrated circuits. Now integrated circuits in those days were TO-5 CAN with two gates or flip flop or something like that. That was radical at the time. I mean more than everything was discreet devices and was in what they called the INFOSEC area was called COMSEC at that time, Communication Security, and that was a black art. There were no textbooks. There were no college courses. There were no courses that you could attend or seminars that you could attend to learn that. Everything was self-taught. Customers would come in, tell us what they wanted, tell us how to do it. We’d asked questions. We’d have very interesting lively exchanges with them and then we taught each other. That was part of that family spirit. We didn’t know anything. What we did know we passed on to our coworkers to make them just as expert... We needed experts and the only way we could find them was not to go out and hire them. We had to create them within our own organization. That bonded us as a team. The IFF system later had another spinoff project which was a Combat Net Radio security device, the KY 38, which was at that time the essential communications device at the Vietnam War. That’s where I met Eddie Mozzi who was running that project. We were using the same technology, sharing the same team efforts, sharing our knowledge with each other, co- developing, essentially similar but different functionality products. That started my career in INFOSEC. That was 1964. I remember that year very well because I think that’s the year the Phillies were 13 games ahead going in to September and then lost the Pennant. I don’t think any of us will ever... any of us local Philadelphia people will never forget that year. Morph or Gene Mauch was the manager at that time and that was the year I started in the INFOSEC area and that basically was almost the rest of my career. That evolved into other projects that were similar. In the late 1970’s, 1980, we won an award for a TRITAC Communication System which involved several devices one of which was a secure telephone called the DSVT. I saw one in the case coming in today out in the lobby, a field telephone that was secure. There was a teletype crypto device built from the same technology and this was a little bit more of an integrated circuit than the ones we had in the earlier equipment. This was basically a custom chip that we designed not complex by today’s standards but very advanced at the time. We were developing the technology to that design and developed these chips at the same time we were building them, not waiting for something to be developed and then use it. It was developing your tools at the same time you’re developing the products. The KG-84 was a teletype encryptor at that time using first real product using integrated circuits. They were CMOS which still is the technology of choice today even though the geometry is  slightly smaller now by orders of magnitude. The teletype encryptor replaced a device called the, I think it was the KW-7, which had a reputation that’s the only teletype encryptor in the military but it had a mean time between failure for about three or four days. So they needed something to replace it, the KG-84 was that device. We developed a prototype that we called a new model of that. We sent several of amounts to the military to try out. They loved it. They said it worked beautifully. The complaint was from their real complaint was from their maintainability people who could not test their maintainability concepts because the damn thing never failed. So we took that as a compliment but they didn’t. That was the beginning of Secure Voice. Secure Voice wherein in the several other products since then. One of them was the STU-III which was the first time we were really developing and working with other contractors to develop a similar product. We had three companies essentially developing the same product. We were not competing on the contract to develop it but we would be competing on the sale of the product. The other companies were Motorola and AT&T. I think John Rittenhouse was our vice president and he said how can you compete with a phone company. The two COMSEC contractors RCA and Motorola skunked AT&T. We built the best product, lowest price and AT&T was playing catch-up the whole time. They didn’t have the spirit of the COMSEC community where you cooperated during the development even though you were competitors. It’s something we learned the hard way. It’s in everybody’s interest. If you cooperate developing the specs and things, well AT&T commercial company always played things close to the best. They never socialized with us during the meetings we had together. All the other guys did know each other like brothers. They went back even to TRITAC days where we were not developing competing products but we’re developing things that had to inner operate with our products. It was a spirit an area that I think the COMSEC community was unique to them. You had people competing companies working together in the common interest and it paid off for everybody. We learned that and paid off. The STU-III sold hundreds of thousands of them. It was at the time when the cold war was at its peak. There were communication towers that were in major cities that were being read in real time by Soviet Intelligence Operations and we needed to secure our communications. The STU-III was the answer at that time. The predecessor equipment was the KY-3 which was like a couple of steamer trunks worth of equipment. I think when Reagan was shot, they showed him going into the hospital followed by these two gurneys of... of carrying these big cases of equipment. You can see on the lettering on it. It said KY-3. That was the secure communication device prior to STU-III. So that was the beginning. It was the first really. At that time, we were trying to develop a product that required digital signal processors where at the same time digital signal processors were being developed. So we were the guinea pig for that. We had to build voice encoders, modems, all digital using products that were being developed at the same time that we were trying to use  [15:12.3] Speaker 2: [15:30.7] McGrogan: [16:28.3] Speaker 2: [16:33.9] McGrogan: [16:59.7] Speaker 2: them. It took a while but we succeeded, developed essentially one of the best two wire echo cancelling modem that ever existed in this world. We had experienced where people would take them into remote outpost and things, embassies, and backward or countries and they say good luck with your secure modem there because we can’t even get a fax machine to work here. And they said it worked fine. It really compensated for all the odd-ball things that communication systems could do. It could live with them. That was one of our great successes. That led to other products which called the Secured Telephone Equipment which was an ISDN secure telephone and this was more advanced and things used newer technology but basically did the same function. As a matter of fact, they build an STU-III compatible mode because they had so many STU-III’s out there. They had still to talk to and they couldn’t replace them all. So that was the whole history of that. Again, we were working with other companies very similar, the same ones we did work with before, cooperating on a common specification that would work together. They had to inter-operate and we just had that community spirit not only within ourselves but within the community of interest which was small but very significant. The process of doing this work was still black art, no textbooks, no published papers to go on. The modems and things and the voice coders were pretty much open technology. The security aspects were still black art, worked with the customers, learned from the customers. Are you... were in a kind of in a unique position... you have basically become essentially a national asset. You’re the person who taught the other people as we came through the whole COMSEC area. That was really part of the joy of doing it is taking somebody raw to the business, teaching them. We had some of the most rigorous design review you ever saw. They were really bloody but nobody ... it wasn’t vicious. It was educational. People learned and we taught them and then they taught others. It was that close-knit group of people. We had our fights internally but nothing vicious. It was all friendly things. Things like you wouldn’t do today. We make ethnic jokes to other people in our team but today in this day in the world that’s not even allowed or permitted. But it was friendly. Nobody took it seriously and it was a form of bonding and friendship. As you were the younger engineer, did you feel like you had any mentors? A lot of the mentoring came from the customer. There was no real technical expertise to draw on but there was some good management and marketing expertise we had, we got a lot of business sole-source because of the personal relationships that were formed between our team and the customer’s team. And you were in the forefront of that.  [17:01.5] McGrogan: Yeah, we went with them, right? We would go to meeting. Marketing guy would take us. He would get us on the door. We’d sit down with counterparts and workout things and they liked us because they didn’t really know what they want and we didn’t know what they want. And it evolved over the course of the program but there was none of those let’s rewrite the contract every time they wanted to change something. We’re working together to solve the same problem, alright. Let’s work it together. You help us with our problems, will help you with yours. There was no employer sitting in the way of impeding progress. It was good natured. Let’s work. We’re a team. We’re teamed with our customer. We’re teamed even with our competitors. We’re all working at the same problem and it’s our common interest to solve the problem. And you had some significant competitors. Oh, yeah. How do you feel the customer looked at RCA? I think they liked us. We got a lot of sole source awards or at least two source or three source awards. We didn’t have to run out and compete with upstarts. As a matter of fact, it was hard for an up-start to get into this business because of the lure and the culture of not only working with this customer but the technology itself was essentially hush, hush. It wasn’t published. We taught each other. We taught our coworkers. And they learned from it and then they became the mentors to the next generation. And what about your supervisors? They never got in our way. That’s all I can say. I eventually became one of them for a while but then I didn’t really like that aspect of the job and went back and became a staff engineer. So you’re saying that just with that you do your work? As long as they were happy. I mean I had some tough supervisors that makes you ... Chalie Schmidt. I mentioned name, but a lot of people he hated and he was hated. But I got along with him fine because let me do my job. If I disagreed with him, he accepted my opinion rather than his own. Yeah, Charlie had a reputation as a very demanding person but the people who produced always seemed to like him. Oh, yeah and he threw some of the best Christmas parties ever. Won’t ask him how he finance them because it may not be legal but there was a lot of trips to Summerfield that paid for Christmas parties that nobody remembers ever going on. [18:02.6] Speaker 2: [18:05.8] McGrogan: [18:06.6] Speaker 2: [18:11.3] McGrogan: [18:51.6] Speaker 2: [18:55.0] McGrogan: [19:08.4] Speaker 2: [19:11.4] McGrogan: [19:36.9] Speaker 2: [19:46.2] McGrogan:  [20:10.5] Speaker 2: [20:25.0] McGrogan: So you’ve been through some very significant projects basically as a trailblazer. How do you think the RCA valued you as a part of this? Well, they let me keep working after I retired so... I think I retired the first time when the Lockheed Martin took over and I was 62 at that time so I could cash out my own RCA lump sum and keep working and go back to work the next day. Worked there three more years till I was 65 and retired again and then worked as essentially a full time consultant for a few more years and I think that really worked... I kind of phased into retirement gradually which was probably the best thing. I phased my way from full time to part time just call me when you need me sort of thing and that went on until about two years ago when I decided I’ve had enough and stopped coming into work. That was retirement. It wasn’t sudden. It was gradual and enjoyed every minute of it. Now, as an observer of what used to call or referred to you people as a cryptographers, there were some rather unusual people in your group, did you notice that? I was probably one of them. I didn’t think of them as unusual but everybody had their own personality and everybody accepted the way everybody else was and we could insult each other till we turned blue in the face and get together and work on solving a common problem the next day. It was just part of the team spirit. Okay. What would you say was the best thing about working for RCA? I think it was the fact that we wanted to be the best and we tried to be the best. Sometimes we succeeded, not always, but it was always a team effort. Everybody contributed and everybody got credit. You’ve heard some other people talk about the transitions from RCA into GE into Martin Marietta. How did that affect you? Well I think there was an era where I think they called like harvesting the seeds that we planted and that went on for a while, it didn’t result any growth and then all of a sudden we kind of find out what we were doing right in the beginning and then went back to it with some new opportunities. I remember my age 65 retirement was September of 1999. I retired on the day we submitted a proposal for something called ACTS that I had worked on that proposal. I was retired and taking a long vacation. I was over in Spain with my wife and we got a call that we won that program. That program went on. It started out, I think, maybe a hundred millions and it went on to hundreds of millions of dollars and I remember doing consulting by phone when I was away and working on that when I was here. It was one of the classic type programs. It was our roots. It was a replacement for the Mil Star system with secure communications basically from Mil Star. But it [21:30.7] Speaker 2: [21:47.9] McGrogan: [22:13.8] Speaker 2: [22:20.9] McGrogan: [22:40.4] Speaker 2: [22:53.1] McGrogan:  [24:34.8] Speaker 2: [24:43.4] McGrogan: [25:06.6] Speaker 2: [25:16.4] McGrogan: [25:58.3] Speaker 2: [26:05.8] McGrogan: [26:45.1] Speaker 2: [27:30.0] McGrogan: was one of the type programs that we done before and did better than anybody else. I think the customer loved it. I asked what was the best part about working for RCA? What was the worst part about working for RCA? I guess the Camden environment. It was never impressive. It didn’t bother me but it made it hard to get other people to come. We tried to hire somebody and they’d have to drive through Camden to get here and they said no thanks. It never bothered me. I mean I just got used to it I guess, developed a thick skin. Do you have any opinions on the assertion that RCA may have actually changed South Jersey? I think it was South Jersey. When I come up to... I mean nowhere you went. It was RCA. Go to a gas station, sign a credit card, receipt and they’d hand you an RCA pen. It was everywhere. Everybody had either knew somebody or had a family member. I mean at one time I worked with third generation RCA employees. It’s the mother. Grandfather started there during World War II and their children went there and they were the third generation all working at RCA. It was a way of life. So how would you sum up your career? Evidently, it was more than just a job. Oh yeah. It was something that I couldn’t ... it was hard to retire actually. Eventually got old enough that I like to sleep late in the morning but when I was working it felt nothing about getting up and coming in before seven o’clock in the morning and going home after six o’clock at night because I enjoyed every minute of it. It was getting something done and it was useful, enjoyable, and working with other people that I enjoyed. Well, Chip, I appreciate you coming in to do this and let me just say as just having been around here and having followed your career, you retired and then were asked to come back several times because they really felt you had knowledge that they simply couldn’t do without. You are genuinely one of the few national assets that we can talk about and what you have done with RCA is just phenomenal. So I appreciate you coming in. Part of it was I go back to my training and when I was in high school, somehow if you were in the first track of high school I went to, you were in the first track of everything. So if I was good in science and math, I also got into the first track with English and Literature and everything else. So in spite of the fact that there are a lot of people who were better writers than I back in when we were high school, when I got to college and work, I was the best writer among the people because of my training and communication was a skilled that very few engineers had which I had somehow manage to   [29:04.3] Speaker 2: [29:14.3] McGrogan: [END OF TRANSCRIPT] hone and teach. I had one coworker who will tell me to this day that I taught him to write in English. He was from South America originally and Poland and then South America and grew up in Brooklyn and never really learn to write clearly and he would give me something he had written and I bleed to death on reading, can give it back to him, and next time it’d read a lot better and it was communication skills that’s important as engineering skills or logic skills or anything else and writing proposals was much part of the business as performing on the job. We won’t mention his name but I can tell you that he did recognize you as one of his teachers. I think he actually appreciated it. Actually he ended up being a cowriter on a book. So that’s how far he came. So I feel good about some of the people I met who are now the leaders in this business.
RCAemployee;Carl Haslett;[START OF TRANSCRIPT] [0:00:07] Carl Haslett: [0:00:43] Male Speaker 2: [0:00:46] Carl Haslett: [0:00:47] Male Speaker 2: [0:00:50] Carl Haslett: My name is Carl Haslett. I started with RCA Broadcast 35 years ago. It was this month in 1980. And I worked for Broadcast up until the division was closed, just prior to a GE purchase. So, I worked for maybe a month or two as RCA recording systems on the government side, and then it was transferred to... or became GE at that point. Do you remember your first job assignment? Yes, I do. Could you talk to that a little bit? My first assignment was to... I came into the magnetic tape group of Broadcast, and they were getting the TR800 ready for... um, they had just unveiled it at the NAB show in Las Vegas, and it was a big hit. It was a very sophisticated tape recorder. A big advance in being able to do special effects right on the tape recorder itself. My first assignment was to draw a block diagram of that unit for the instruction books. Because, of course they did all the engineering, got that all out of the way. They’re ready to start producing them to give to customers, and they didn’t have instruction books. So, as a fresh out of college but with some broadcast background, they had me go around and talk to all the engineers, to get each of the individual pieces, so I could draw a single, block diagram for the whole unit. Um, did you have any kind of a mentor or anything when you started? Yes, I did. The guy I remember most was Walt Murdock. He was probably about my age now. He knew everybody in the plant. There was like, 4,000 people here then, in RCA and all the different parts of RCA. He seemed to know everything about the place, where everything was. As you go down the hall, there was nobody who didn’t give a wave to him and say “Hi.” Um, and he taught me a lot about getting... you know, where things were, and getting a good foothold on my career in the Broadcast group. And he was very knowledgeable on electrical circuits, things like that, too. And also, um, for more theoretical mentor was Bob [0:01:49] Male Speaker 2: [0:01:53] Carl Haslett: [0:02:55] Male Speaker 2: [0:03:03] Carl Haslett: Thomas. He was like the senior design video engineer, and I enjoyed working with him a lot. Okay, that’s great. Um, as far as major projects that you’ve worked on, what stands out? What do you remember? Well, the TR800, getting that into production and demo-ing it to different people. We were on the forefront of what everybody now thinks of as HDTV back then, and trying... even then, we knew that television needed to be improved. So, we embarked on a project to make, uh, what they call component recording. And we stunned the Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers by showing up at a meeting that they were going to talk about doing equipment, and how they might do this. We stunned them by showing up with a recorder that actually did what they were thinking in theory. Nobody knew we were working on it. We did it under our advanced development work. So that was quite an accomplishment, and something that, you know, really kept us in the forefront for a couple of years. And also, when we eventually, were just doing a lot of camera work, it was the development of the first CCD cameras for electronic news gathering. Including a special shuttered one that allowed us to do freeze frames. For example, we shot some video at the racetrack, and did the equivalent of a photo finish using that camera. That was the first time, ‘cause normal television cameras in those days were all blurry if you tried to actually shoot something that was moving fast. Mm-hm, so how do you think RCA valued you as a part of the project? I think even right up to the end, at least in the broadcast division which is like where I was most of the time, um, very much so. Because we, um... I don’t... that’s part of the reason I’m still here with all through the following companies. Because, uh, some of the people that were involved then are still here, too. And it, uh, um... I mean, we had all kinds of other activities going on that were supported. Um, just... it was like a family. I mean, we had, uh... uh, first of all, we had a great relationship on being able to buy any RCA products. The “Family Store,” as it was called in those days. That kind of, uh, thing where they had, uh, things of value for the employees. Back when we had the 4,000 sum people here, we had two bowling leagues. Those were well supported by... By the company. We had softball games, we had, uh, Christmas parties for each of the individual sections, as well as an overall Christmas party. And I, um... There was recognition for us within our, um, uh, [0:04:38] Male Speaker 2: [0:04:43] Carl Haslett:  [0:06:20] Male Speaker 2: [0:06:31] Carl Haslett: technical community, too. Uh, you know, were either promotions or special on the spot award type things. So it was... It was very enjoyable to work for RCA. You used the term “family.” We’ve heard a lot about the RCA family. Um, what’s it mean to you? Well, um, when I came in, there was about six or seven of us that hired in within that year. And we... In addition to hanging around with some of the older employees, we kind of formed, I don’t know, I wouldn’t call it a clique. But, it was a group of us. You know, we did a lot of things outside of that. We’d go to, uh, happy hours for example on Fridays. A lot of us were on those bowling teams I mentioned. Uh, we had some other interests like scale model railroading, things like that, that we got together outside, and that’s why it was more than just a 9:00 to 5:00, or 8:00 to 5:00 type of job. I think that’s the best way to describe it. It was, um... uh, and like the older... And managers as well as engineers were pretty, um, like friendly and just interested in things that were going on besides what you were working on. For example, uh, this is kind of a funny story. I had... I guess it was about around 1985. I bought a boat off of Paul Morocco, who was by then the government communications recording manager. He had bought the boat from Charlie Rockfus, who was the mechanical, uh, manager for that group. And then I ended up selling the boat to another engineer in the group. So, there’s that kind of a thing. Where you knew so much about what other people did, and their outside activities, that you kind of shared experiences and things like that. So, um, that’s just the kind of thing that, you know, is like a family. Talk about your co-workers at work. Well, um, we were, uh... yeah, there was kind of two groups of us. There was the younger guys who had all come in right there in 1980, ‘cause they were staffing up for, uh, this push toward higher definition television, as well as digital recording. Um, we would go to lunch together all the time actually. Um, meaning we were younger, and all of us at that time were single. Uh, we would go to the...There were maybe six or seven lunch places right around here because of, again, 4,000-sum people plus Campbell Soup. One thing we rarely actually did was eat in the RCA cafeteria. We would tend to... And we had a little bit of free cash (chuckles), freer cash maybe than the older folks. And, uh, so we would go up the street to Shirley’s or George’s, or the New York Deli place. Uh, places like that to eat lunch. So, we actually eat lunch together almost all the time. Mm-hm. What was it like working with them? [0:08:38] Male Speaker 2: [0:08:44] Carl Haslett: [0:09:52] Male Speaker 2:  [0:09:56] Carl Haslett: Oh. Um, it was good. We were... We were all from the different schools. Like, you know, there was... I was from Lehigh University. Um, one of the other fellas was from Drexel. There was a young man I remember... This was especially interesting. He actually was one of the Vietnamese children airlifted out of Saigon, then went to school in Texas because his... His family, or he had family in Texas, was able to go there and become educated. And he spoke excellent English by the time he became an engineer. His name was P.T. Chung. And he was, uh, so interesting to be able to listen to some of his stories, but, he was a real hard worker. Uh, and just to understand, you know, somebody coming here under those circumstances, whereas the rest of us were, you know, Americans pretty much, that grew up and got the chance to go to college, and work for a corporation. Um, Doug Lidow was one of my roommates. Actually, he and I roomed together the first two years that I was here, because I knew him from Lehigh from, uh, before. Uh, I actually didn’t come here until I had my Master’s degree. So, he had a head start on me. Uh, but we got re-acquainted and, uh, we roomed together the first two years. Um, let’s see. Um, Jim Chamberlain is, uh, had come from the graduate school. Um, he was an expert in, uh, the beginnings of what you think of as video, um, movement on the screen. Things that everybody takes for granted today in the video games and stuff. He’s one of the people who developed that early on, and ended up coming here. Um, but it was a... Like I say it was... Everybody had, um, a wealth of background knowledge. That’s one thing that definitely, for RCA in general. Even a few of the, of the older engineers that I work with, and maybe didn’t have necessarily a college degree or an advanced degree, the wealth of knowledge that we had in constructing and building that equipment and solving problems. Uh, there’s so many times that we would just band together, and work to get something out to that National Association of Broadcast convention every year. To get new technology rolling and working. How did you stay up with the technology? Well in those days, uh, no internet of course. We had... First of all within broadcast, there was the Society of Motion Picture and television Engineers. So they published a journal. Uh, we had the I- EEE Journals on various topics, and technical magazines that have kind of gone by the wayside or had become web-based these days. I had already had, uh, my Master’s degree, but, a lot of RCA was very supportive of people going and getting advanced education at Drexel or Penn and so on. So, there were opportunities like that to [0:11:47] [0:12:33] Male Speaker 2: [0:12:36] Carl Haslett:  [0:13:44] Male Speaker 2: [0:13:47] Carl Haslett: stay abreast of the technology. And we were, uh... especially us younger guys were, um, taking along to all of these National Association of Broadcaster conventions, or the SYMTI conventions twice a year. Again, to see what the competitors are doing, and to keep up with, uh, the papers that were being presented. Talk about your supervisors. What were they like? Uh, my first supervisor was Ukah Hemmeweiman, who went on to, um, whenever RCA, uh, ceased to exist or at least the broadcast division did, he went on to be a manager at Panasonic. And uh, he was... He was from Finland, and he had a, uh, tremendous background in television. Um, he was great to work with. He always called us “fellas”. That’s again that family idea. It was always, “Fellas, fellas, we must get this research finished.” Or, “We must get this circuit board done by the week, end of the week.” Um, he was really good to work for. Um, Dick West was another manager that was very dedicated toward getting things accomplished and done. Uh, as I remember Lee Hedland was head of the entire group of the tape world, and he was a... He really was a pretty good iron hand, ‘cause we got caught a lot of times coming back from Friday lunches, taking two hours ‘cause we would ride over in a large nine-passenger station wagon to someplace in Philly that has lunch. And come back and, uh, he would be kind of looking and seeing us come down the hall. So we all had to stay, you know, 5:30-6:00 or whatever to be sure we had put in the time. How did they treat you? Uh, I would say certainly fairly. And uh, more than just a manager- employee kind of thing. They were... um, quite often we were... Well for example, uh, the bowling teams had a combination of managers and engineers. Um, so we socialized as well as, uh, working, uh, on the projects. They were, um, only demanding when... And it was a group kind of thing. We knew we needed to get things done and out the door. Um, but nobody... Rarely do we have any personal problems with any of the managers. Okay, now, RCA Broadcast basically closed rather abruptly? Yes, it did. Did that mean you got laid off, or what happened? Well, it was a... It was a real surprise. Um, I know for a couple of reasons that the abruptness came all the way from the top. Because [0:15:26] Male Speaker 2: [0:15:29] Carl Haslett: [0:16:16] Male Speaker 2: [0:16:23] Carl Haslett: [0:16:24] Male Speaker 2: [0:16:27] Carl Haslett:  [0:18:26] Male Speaker 2: [0:18:36] Carl Haslett: myself and a couple of other engineers were scheduled to take a camera up to one of the vendor locations. I mean, a very extensive trip. And I know there’s no way they would have planned that, and had that up to the last second if... If they had any inkling that, that was going to be closed, and that project would become cancelled. Um, what happened to... All of the engineers were either able... They either decided to go out on their own. But, the rest of RCA was still in a hiring mode in most places. So, I actually interviewed at Moorestown and ATL and, uh, the government side. And that’s like... Because I had known there was a large synergy between the government recoding group, and they were on the fifth floor and we were on the second floor in the old buildings. So myself, folks like Tim Orman, um, Matt Tige, and a number of other engineers, I guess, Tom Casney would be one who’s still here. Um, we were told, “If you just want to come up here and work, just come up here and work. You can interview the other places if that’s what you want to do, but, we have plenty of openings up here.” So, it turned out that it was just a very... Just worked out well for everybody that all the engineers ended up being placed, or if they had decided to go out on their own, they did. But, no one had ended up losing up a job, in the engineering world anyway, with the result of that closing. So, it just was very fortunate timing. We also talk about RCA changing South Jersey. Do you have any opinions on that? Well, um, up until recently I probably wouldn’t have thought that much until... I’ve been involved in, um, a lot of um, acoustic amateur music in the last several years. And it’s really rare if I don’t run into somebody who says, “Oh, my dad worked at RCA.” Or, they’re really aware of what it had meant at one time. Uh, so, it definitely had an impact because it such a large employer, I know long before I was here. And uh, as a result of that it definitely had influence, uh, certainly in the older days. We have a lot of photographs here still in our cafeteria about the... From the heyday, we realize how busy things were. But, yeah... Um, what is your view of RCA in the industry? What was their reputation? Um, how did they stack up against the other companies? Uh, in broadcast they were the premier supplier of equipment and maintainers, because of a well thought out approach to having the manufacturing. And uh, a service company that was available, something like 24, 48 hours on-site. A great customer support, that type of thing. [0:19:44] Male Speaker 2: [0:19:57] Carl Haslett:  [0:22:18] Male Speaker 2: [0:22:30] Carl Haslett: And in the government side, when I transferred over there, ‘cause we had maintained that or tried to maintain that reputation. Um, they were a... A premier government supplier for the aircraft tape recorders. Uh, Small ICBM, some other projects over the years that... Uh, the radar systems, I guess, GWEN, the Ground Wave Emergency Network. Um, I never went any place that they didn’t have a superior reputation like that. And I do have another little funny story. Uh, on one of the broadcast trips to, of all places, imagine this being a place you’d have to travel in the middle of winter. The SYMTE convention was at Disney World. So, we go to Disney World, and I was with one of the other managers on the way back. Um, we go in and we have... In those days, there was a company called Travel Co with an RCA, almost like, uh, the RCA pencil I have here with a logo on it. They had the RCA logo on our tickets. Of course, those days everything was tickets and the funky printing. So, we walk up to the counter and, uh, the guy at the airlines says, “Oh RCA, we love you guys ‘cause you do the Space Mountain and this, and then all the attractions. And you support all that stuff, so great.” (laughs). The manager says, “Well if you like us so well, why don’t you bump us up to first class?” And the guys goes, “Oh yeah, no problem.” Well, I assume he’s joking, right? We give the ticket, we’re ticketed in and we go in to the plane, we’re in first class. So, we definitely had, uh... You know, RCA really meant something to the world. Okay, Carl. Um, any other things you want us to talk about? Any, uh, other recollections? Any comments you want to make before we wrap this up? Um, just that uh, I’m glad to see that there are efforts to keep RCA alive, in a certain sense. Um, one of the things my father had, which is a cherished relic to me, I actually have not only an RCA small gramophone, but, I also have a wax recording disc. In other words, a record maker. It’s a lathe that you record a 78, and it’ll play on any 78 machine. To think of the legacy of all that kind of stuff not getting lost in the modern world of, uh, dot coms, and all the other things that are happening that... You know, I... I am glad to see efforts like that, and, uh, would hope that, that kind of thing continue, ‘cause that’s... Um, you now work for L-3. You’ve been through all the transitions. Um, is there any residual of the RCA family that you can still see or feel around here? Uh, a little bit. Um, uh, most of the folks in upper management right now were with RCA at some point. Um, and we still have softball [0:23:35] Male Speaker 2: [0:23:47] Carl Haslett:  [END OF TRANSCRIPT] games, we still have some, uh... Maybe once a year, we have a little picnic thing outside. Um, I guess it’s uh, it’s not completely been eliminated, but, I think that’ because the people are still... uh, a lot of us are still here. And uh, are interested in that kind of thing, softball tournament and things like that. Keeping that stuff going.
RCAemployee;Bryan Hodgson;[START OF TRANSCRIPT] [0:00:06] Bryan Hodgson: [0:00:16] Female Speaker: [0:00:20] Bryan Hodgson: [0:00:41] Female Speaker: [0:00:46] Bryan Hodgson: [0:00:48] Female Speaker: [0:00:50] Bryan Hodgson: [0:00:59] Female Speaker: [0:01:04] Bryan Hodgson: [0:01:14] Female Speaker: [0:01:22] Bryan Hodgson: [0:01:35] Female Speaker: [0:01:37] Bryan Hodgson: [0:01:38] Female Speaker: [0:01:42] Bryan Hodgson: I'm Bryan Hodgson. If you want to be formal, Dr. Bryan Hodgson. I worked in RCA Moorestown in the same building for about 20 years. Great. What was the first position you had with RCA? The first position was as a unit manager. The doctor, Dr. Bill Patton, brought me into the company. The original title was going to be air- born and electronic warfare antenna, but by the time I actually reached my desk that job had gone away and so I just went into an R&D function with the company. What was that like? Did you...What was it like being a brand new employee at RCA? Oh yes, brand new, yes. What was that like? It was the biggest company I had ever worked for, so it was a little daunting initially, but I got on fine with the rest of the people in the building, so I had no problem really. Did you have a mentor, somebody who led you through as a young... Mo Briezewas the manager I reported to and so he was very good, really. I found him very, very workable with...workable with. What kind of things did he do to sort of help you become a good...to inspire you or make you a better worker? I think the cooperation I got from him and just sorting out any problems I had and basically he was very approachable, which made it easier. Approachability. Speak up just a little more? Sure, no problem. How were your coworkers? Well, of course they were all engineers, so were all fine (laughter). An engineer is an engineer and usually they're very much, very similar in the way you can approach them and the assistance that you can get from them. They usually give you any assistance they can, so I got on quite well with them, yes. [0:02:03] Female Speaker: [0:02:06] Bryan Hodgson: [0:02:10] Female Speaker: [0:02:13] Bryan Hodgson: [0:02:33] Female Speaker: [0:02:35] Bryan Hodgson: [0:02:54] Female Speaker: [0:02:59] Bryan Hodgson: [0:03:22] Female Speaker: [0:03:26] Bryan Hodgson: [0:03:26] Female Speaker: [0:03:27] Bryan Hodgson: [0:03:27] Female Speaker: [0:03:28] Bryan Hodgson: [0:03:34] Female Speaker: [0:03:41] Bryan Hodgson: [0:03:42] Female Speaker: [0:03:43] Bryan Hodgson: So you feel like you worked like a team then? Certainly, certainly it was. Yes. What was the most significant project you worked on? Well of course, after about five years in that R&D function, they moved me into the program management office, which was AEGIS based and so I was working on the AEGIS arrays for about the last 12 years of my time there. Can you tell us about AEGIS? Well, as you know, it's an antenna. They put four of them on a ship so that it can see 360 degrees around and they weigh about six tons and they take about a year to build and the Navy seems to love them. What was your role in helping build them or develop them? It was hardware, between hardware and paperwork. I was involved in trying to work on many snags that arose during the manufacture and there was a significant amount of paperwork went into each array and basically it generated a three-inch thick file for each antenna and so I was involved in keeping that all straight. What was the biggest snag you ever encountered in doing all this? Time. Time. Time, yes. Trying to get everything done fast enough? Yes, that's right. Try to get...pull all the ends together, yes. How did your...so you, you...after about five years, you got started on AEGIS and how did your career progress from there? Well I... How many did you work on? When I came out to my unit. In 1988, GE took over and their philosophy was that every unit manager had to have about 10 or 12 people working for him. Well, I only had three people working for him, so my unit manager position went out the window and I became a senior engineer...in the program of organization.  [0:04:05] Female Speaker: [0:04:09] Bryan Hodgson: [0:04:12] Female Speaker: [0:04:15] Bryan Hodgson: [0:04:47] Female Speaker: [0:04:48] Bryan Hodgson: [0:04:50] Female Speaker: [0:04:55] Bryan Hodgson: [0:04:56] Female Speaker: [0:05:02] Bryan Hodgson: [0:05:03] Female Speaker: [0:05:05] Bryan Hodgson: [0:05:08] Female Speaker: [0:05:09] Bryan Hodgson: [0:05:13] Female Speaker: [0:05:13] Bryan Hodgson: [0:05:15] Female Speaker: [0:05:19] Bryan Hodgson: [0:05:52] Female Speaker: And how did that... did that change your job a lot? No, not really, no, no. Did you find it...how different was it working under GE for you? I don't know. They weren't there for long enough. Here...a small anecdote with RCA. You know that they had an RCA store in the building, okay. Well, they use to sell televisions, all that sort of stuff. Well, quite frequently at 11 o'clock in the morning, you will see factory people watching baseball games in the RCA store, okay. Well, GE came in and that stopped dead. That didn't go on anymore, so you can see GE was concerned about tightening up the ship quite a bit. A different culture. Very different, yes, yes. But you don't feel like in your day-to-day work that a different culture changed things too much? No, not that I saw. And did you continue on with L-3 then or did you retire before then? Sorry, did I continue on with? After GE left and L-3 came in? If I don't forget, then it became Martin Marietta. I'm sorry... Okay. Then finally it became Lockheed and I retired in '02. In '02? Mm-huh. What was the best thing working for RCA? I think the overall experience, I can't point to any one particular item, but I enjoyed my time with...in that building, okay, whichever name was on the front, I enjoyed my time there. I never thought that when I joined them in '82 that I would wind up retiring 20 years later. I never thought that the job would last that long, but the Navy would just keep on buying ships and I said, hey, you buy the ships and we'll stick antenna's on them, okay. What was the worst thing about working at RCA?  [0:05:58] Bryan Hodgson: [0:06:06] Female Speaker: [0:06:17] Bryan Hodgson: [0:06:18] Female Speaker: [0:06:20] Bryan Hodgson: [0:06:57] Female Speaker: [0:07:00] Bryan Hodgson: [0:07:14] Female Speaker: [0:07:17] Bryan Hodgson: [0:07:20] Female Speaker: [0:07:30] Bryan Hodgson: [0:07:44] Female Speaker: [0:07:46] Bryan Hodgson: [0:07:47] Female Speaker: [0:07:49] Bryan Hodgson: [0:07:50] Female Speaker: [0:07:51] Bryan Hodgson: [0:07:52] Female Speaker: I don't know that there was one. Nothing sticks in my mind as being a particular nuisance. No, I don't recall there being one. Yeah, great. How did you handle the changes of technology that happened in the 20-30 years that you were working for GE? Uh... Did they have to train you. Is there things that would change with... Yeah. One of the biggest changes that occurred on the arrays was a change in the style of coaxial cable that they started to use and that required an immense amount of mechanical effort, okay, but one of my parts of it was presenting what was happening inside the factory to all the Navy Brass and all the incoming RCA and GE people, so giving presentations was one of my great pleasures when I was there, I always used to enjoy that. So you get to explain what's going on to everyone else? Well, you see, I always used to introduce hardware or graphics or moving items and I could hold the audience quite well, and I got the compliment once where one of the people came up and said, well, I wish you had been my professor at college. Do you have good jokes? Not... not so much jokes as...it was graphics. It was good graphics, yes. Good graphics makes things interesting. Did you have a social life with your coworkers? Not so much. I have followed up with them since then, but no, I had a family of three sons. The three sons were all very active in swimming and so any social life was basically resolved around water. Yeah, living from pool to pool. Pool, pool, pool. Where did you live why you were...? We lived in Voorhees In Voorhees Yes. What was Voorhees like when you first moved there? Was it really different?  [0:07:55] Bryan Hodgson: [0:08:12] Female Speaker: [0:08:16] Bryan Hodgson: [0:08:19] Female Speaker: [0:08:27] Bryan Hodgson: [0:08:27] Female Speaker: [0:08:28] Bryan Hodgson: [0:08:29] Female Speaker: [0:08:32] Bryan Hodgson: [0:08:36] Female Speaker: [0:08:43] Bryan Hodgson: [0:09:05] Female Speaker: [0:09:11] Bryan Hodgson: [0:09:16] Female Speaker: [0:09:20] Bryan Hodgson: [0:09:28] Female Speaker: [0:09:34] Bryan Hodgson: Obviously there was a tremendous amount of construction going on there since, okay. We moved into a small subdivision, Acorn Hill, and it was good. It was convenient for Moorestown. I could get to Moorestown relatively easily. Mm-huh. And were other RCA employees near you? Not that I know of, no, not that I know. Like your kids school, their classmates weren't necessarily...their parents weren't RCA employees necessarily? No. Not very many of them? No. Cherry Hill was the big center for a lot of that I think. That's right. All of my guys went to Eastern, you know, went to Eastern. So, what did your kids think about your career at RCA? Did they know what you did or did you talk about it with them? They knew what I did, but it's not easy discussing some of the aspects of the job to them. It was not easy stuff to describe. They did go to one or two of the open houses and they saw where I worked on. I think they were suitably impressed. Good. And did you...could you share information about AEGIS with them or is that all classified? Well, some of the general stuff you could, but classified stuff I still don't say anything about. I can imagine for boys, that would be an interesting topic? Well, they knew dad had a secret clearance, but I mean, beyond that, they didn't know. So, there's this trend called the RCA family. What does that mean to you? It means that RCA was a very family oriented company when I joined them, which as I said GE put an end to a lot of that when they came in. So, in the open days and this sort of thing, it was family oriented. The fact that the company would bother to bring families in, like  [0:10:12] Female Speaker: [0:10:17] Bryan Hodgson: [0:10:47] Female Speaker: [0:10:52] Bryan Hodgson: [0:10:54] Female Speaker: [0:10:56] Bryan Hodgson: [0:11:06] Female Speaker: [0:11:15] Bryan Hodgson: every other year, I think it was. It meant that there was an interest in the company and keeping things running smoothly. So, how would you sum up your time at RCA? I guess the 20 years, I enjoyed it very much. I had a good career there. I enjoyed it. The work was always very innovative. You could introduce new ideas, where you thought they were worthwhile and I got on...I interacted a lot with a lot of Navy personal because we were selling something to the Navy, so I interacted with them. I got along fine with them and as you may guess sometimes the accent works wonders. How was it working with the government. So, you worked with the Navy a lot. Was it...was it? Yes, it's the...people that... Part of the snags... Were they... No, no. Very seldom. Occasionally I had to chase after them to get a final...final signature or something of that sort, but, no, I got along fine with them. Great. Well anything else you want to share about your experience at RCA? I don't know. I could tell you some of the stuff that we built. In that initial R&D period before GE came in it was all very much, a lot of R&D money lying around, and, so we would involved in developing different types of antenna radiating elements, different types of different frequency band radiating elements, and all this other stuff, and one of the things that was...was a very light weight antenna. We built a very light weight antenna, built out of carbon fiber, built out of carbon fiber and metal-foil. This thing was about 8 feet long, about the size of that cabinet back there. You could quite easily lift it up and carry it around. I think the ultimate intention was sort of put this in the belly of a drone or some sort of light airplane for looking down on the ground, though I never did hear how far it went. I never did hear if it was ever used. Thank you so much for your time. Very good. I enjoyed your... Nice talking. [0:12:14] Female Speaker: [0:12:16] Bryan Hodgson: [0:12:16] Female Speaker: [0:12:17] Bryan Hodgson:  [0:12:18] Female Speaker: [0:12:19] Bryan Hodgson: [0:12:37] Female Speaker: [0:12:40] Bryan Hodgson: [0:12:57] Female Speaker: [0:12:59] Bryan Hodgson: [0:13:18] Female Speaker: [0:13:21] Bryan Hodgson: [END OF TRANSCRIPT] Thank you. I'm very happy to be here. This is just like being home in my basement. I can see some of the pieces I brought in here. I can still recognize them and I have another nipper. He's halfway between that one and this one. He stands about this high, so he's got to come down here sometime, okay. Did you get it...at the RCA store? I forgot where he came from, but what I used to do when anybody retired or left, I use to go through their desk after they left and pull out all the RCA stuff, so which is why I got bookcases full of stuff and boxes full of stuff and nippers and radios and you name it, all sorts of stuff. You had a lot of things to keep. Yes. Because when we came over to the United States in '67, yeah, you couldn't really visualize where you were going to be, like 40 years later, but basically we were very fortunate. We were very fortunate. What we had to do was to learn to drive on the wrong side of the road and use their funny money, but basically it was a very good move. Thank you so much for your conversation with us today. My pleasure, thank you.
RCAemployee;Bob Thompson;[START OF TRANSCRIPT] [0:00:07] Bob Thompson:[0:01:06] Male Speaker 2: [0:01:12] Bob Thompson:I am Bob Thompson and I began in June of 1957. I was a Co-op student from Drexel Institute of Technology and continued all my Co-op assignments in Camden in the, um, what was the...become the communication systems division. And, ah, graduated in ’61 and after some assignments in Moorestown and Manhattan and Princeton, I finally got a permanent job in Camden. And then quickly ah, became an engineer in the applied research division in building ten on the eight floor, ah, doing designs for video recorders.Okay. So what was your first assignment and how did you feel about it?Well, ah, my first assignment was to... as a Co-op student was to, ah, help the engineers develop a better solid state digital component called a Flipflop. And in those days, ah, a Flipflop was a number of transistors, capacitors and resistors on a single plugg-in card. And, um, I had to test uh, new type transistors and new type capacitors, and, ah, it was a little bit difficult for a first-year electrical engineering student who hadn’t had any electronics background at all. But I was very fortunate to work in the laboratory with some very expert laboratory technicians who, uh, you know picked me up and carried me by my elbows.Okay. And then you, uh, came to RCA. What major projects did you work on?So, ah, I guess one of the most exciting projects was one with the National Security Agency. And, um, we’re pledged not to discuss exactly what we were doing with them except that it was well- known that we were building very exotic recording equipment for them in their activities overseas.Um, and then from there, where did you go?Well, ah, some of the more interesting assignments involved a video recording for the broadcast television industry. At that time almost every TV station and every facility that made programs for TV used an RCA television camera, especially after colored television became very popular. Uh, but there was always a host of video recording equipment to go with the TV cameras, and that was a split between the Ampex Corporation, a company that invented video recording and RCA, the company who licensed Ampex for all the television[0:02:15] Male Speaker 2: [0:02:21] Bob Thompson:[0:02:54] Male Speaker 2: [0:02:57] Bob Thompson:[0:05:04]circuits that were in the video recorders. And in an essence, we split the market with Ampex corporation. So there was for every time a network or a TV station wanted to buy recording equipment, there’d be a competition, and that was where the fun began.Then what that led to was some exciting new technology in video recording and the creation of standards for the videotapes so that, um, the company that made the program and put it on tape could send it to a studio and the studio had a compatible video recorder to play it back, and, ah, I became involved in the standards committees. And this was a combination of the manufacturers RCA and Ampex and others and Sony, and the networks CBS, NBC, ABC, which were the only networks at the time.And, ah, that led to some very interesting political, uh, maneuvering. One example is, um, when high definition was first exhibited in Japan, it became all the rage. And the standards committee for determining the number of lines per picture height and the number of picture elements per picture width and the frame rates, uh, were all very important issues that the Japanese wanted to solidify right around their development. But it didn’t make sense from the point of view of users. So it became important for committee members like myself to help, uh, guide the standard so that it would be maximally useful for the users, but also not such a burden that the manufacturers would have to redo everything they had done up to that time.And we had just come out with a new camera that, ah, we were trying to sell all around the world, and the head guy from the company in Japan called NHK, the, ah, television big deal in Japan said, “We will buy your first production run of cameras if you convince your standards committee to use our format exactly as it is right now.” And of course we couldn’t do that but then I thought it was a very interesting ploy on their part.Now, you, ah, donated a color TV camera to us. Um, they, ah, charge coupled device camera, um, what was that about?Well, ah, we, we had pioneered the use of computer-controlled cameras that use conventional tube pickups as the sensitive device that converts images into electronics. Um, and then one of the engineers said, “You know, that...those tubes require a lot of circuitry for high voltage and, um, control and complex computer, we could actually improve the imagery if we used a solid state device to replace the tubes.” So, ah, based on a lot of work done at the Sarnoff Princeton Laboratories, they decided that charge coupled devices would be very appropriate to replace the tubes in a[0:07:07] Male Speaker 2: [0:07:19] Bob Thompson:[0:08:53]television camera, and they developed a very impressive model at Princeton and then the engineers in Camden took that and actually made it into a camera, and took a model to the World Series and showed off one of the, ah, big advantage of the solid-state camera.And that was...you could see the scenes of the pitcher’s pitch as it came toward home play. And, ah, once that was shown at the World Series, almost every TV camera customer, ah, around the United States called in and wanted to buy one right away. Of course, they weren’t available for a number of years. But, um, as a result of that development, we did have a production run of those solid-state cameras. And in addition, we won an Emmy Award, a, ah, Emmy Award for engineering achievement, and that went right on the tail of a previous Emmy Award we had won for the first camera recorder. We made the tube type camera and a small video recorder into a single package that you could carry around on your shoulder including a battery.So as far as your work at RCA, how did your career progress? How was the experience?Well, um, when I graduated, ah, I became one of several thousand engineers that were here in Camden. I remember, ah, our first day as a Co-op student in the orientation. The, ah, the head person said, “You’re joining 16,000 people here in Camden.” And that wasn’t including the several thousand that were in Moorestown at that time. So, ah, being one of the several thousand engineers you always wondered what was going to happen. And, um, the, ah, the whole idea was to, ah, get your project done in a timely manner and get the circuit that you were working on as an electrical engineer, ah, to be completed in time to meet the program schedule. And then, another point was to work with the mechanical engineers who had a difficult job of, ah, putting these circuits on to circuit boards and into cabinets, ah, to make the project remain on schedule.Um, talk a little bit about your co-workers. How was it?Well, that was a very interesting thing. Ah, growing up in South Jersey, the only people I ever knew were people from the local area. But as soon as I became an engineer here, ah, the, uh, engineers around you were from New York State, Wisconsin, Virginia and, ah, it was, ah, exciting to meet people that you didn’t grow up with. The thing I remember most about...most of these new engineers I met was how smart they were. The, um, the portion of the company called College Relations made it a point to try and hire number one or number two in their graduating class of electrical engineers or[0:09:58] Male Speaker 2: [0:10:08] Bob Thompson:[0:11:40] Male Speaker 2: [0:11:43] Bob Thompson:[0:12:55] Male Speaker 2: [0:12:57] Bob Thompson:mechanical engineers, which were mainly the type of engineers we worked with on our projects.What about your supervisors?Well, ah, the one good thing that, ah, where we were very fortunate in the applied research group was that, ah, the supervisors were all comparatively young. And, ah, as soon as they reached 40, someone from one of the operating divisions would pluck them out into a bigger assignment either in Camden or Moorestown or maybe Indianapolis or Manhattan for a bigger job, and that always, ah, left room for a younger guy to become a supervisor and then the young supervisor to become a manager. So, ah, as a result, um, you got to rub shoulders with these brilliant engineers who were always working their way up, ah...You work with them two or three years and, boom, they’d get a promotion to another business.It sounds like there was a lot of hiring from within as far as the promotions spot.Oh, definitely. It, it was very unusual to see an assignment of a manager or a vice president that came from outside the company. Ah, I think the priority in the...We called it the personnel department at that time. I guess, ah, it might be called human resources by now. Ah, but personnel seemed to guide the presidents to hire from within.Um, in several of the interviews, the term “the RCA family” has come up, what does that mean to you?Yeah, that, that, ah, that term “the RCA family” has great meaning because even though it was used by the personnel department and, um, and it was a talking point, you really had the impression that it was true, that they considered you, ah, more than just an employee. And, um, even in meetings with your supervisor and in larger meetings were his supervisor would be present, ah, you had this feeling of a true family. Um, I remember, ah, once a week the head of applied research who was three levels up would have a meeting with all the engineers and technicians and he would give a little speech and he would give out a piggy bank to each of the new fathers that were in the room. And, ah, I think that was a, ah, a good example of how everybody bought into the family concept.What about socializing outside of work?Well, ah, one nice thing was, ah, every Friday we would get together and drive a couple of blocks down into South Camden and go to an Italian restaurant. And we always had an hour, a one hour lunch[0:14:07] Male Speaker 2: [0:14:12] Bob Thompson:[0:14:49] Male Speaker 2: [0:14:56] Bob Thompson:[0:16:22] Male Speaker 2: [0:16:26] Bob Thompson:[0:17:34] Male Speaker 2: [0:17:40] Bob Thompson:[0:18:09] Male Speaker 2: [0:18:22] Bob Thompson:[0:19:11] Male Speaker 2: [0:19:21] Bob Thompson:period, and on Fridays we might even extend it to one and a half hours. And, ah, there would always be a group of 12, 16, 20 people sitting around a big table at the Italian restaurant in South Camden. Um, and then, ah, more than once a month we would get together after work. Um, during the, um, layoff times, ah, when engineers would get better jobs elsewhere because they were on layoff, we would have these, ah, great going away parties for them, ah, and, um, they were always fun.Well, we’ve also heard about, um, Christmas Eve and Christmas parties and things like that. Do you have any...Well, ah, I was, ah, single for about 10 years after I started here. So those Christmas parties were always a joy for me because I was not obliged to go home, ah, right after work. And, ah, there was, ah, always quite a bit of celebrating going on in the Christmas parties.We’ve also had some suggestion that RCA had a significant influence on South Jersey. Do you have any, any input there?The one thing I remember is, ah, the, the influence on Camden, ah... On a Friday night, ah, which was pay day for many of the employees, it was, uh, difficult to walk along the sidewalk on, uh, Broadway or Federal Street because, ah, there were crowds out shopping, ah, in the heart of Camden. And, um, this extended for blocks and blocks and blocks, and I attributed...well, not only to RCA but to the other businesses in the city that included Campbell’s Soup.Um, how do you, uh, how would you rate RCA among the industries?Well, uh, since it’s the only place I ever worked, it’s hard to compare that, however, in comparing notes with customers and partners, ah... For example, we had a very important customer, the Lockheed Missile and Space Company in Sunnyvale, California. And, ah, we work closely with a number of their employees and we learned that, um, we were a lot better off, ah, than the average Lockheed employee. Um, one of the things, of course, was the, ah, the family... um, and the other was the way your, um, supervisor handled you, ah, which was, ah, more paternal than what you would learn in a business.What would you say was the best part working for RCA?The money. [laughter] Uh, RCA was not shy about, ah, giving you a raise if, ah, you warranted it. And, ah, when I became a supervisor, uh, I never felt constrained about giving any of my engineers a raise if everyone felt they deserved it.[0:20:27] Male Speaker 2: [0:20:33] Bob Thompson:[0:21:02] [0:21:05][0:21:32] [0:21:37][0:22:29] [0:22:37][0:23:55]Male Speaker 2: Bob Thompson:Male Speaker 2: Bob Thompson:Male Speaker 2: Bob Thompson:What was the worst thing about working for RCA?Well, of course, the worst was, um, when large government contracts would come to an end and there had to be layoffs. And you had to spend hours and hours and hours in meetings making determinations of which engineers to keep and which engineers to let go.So how would you sum up your time at RCA?I felt it was terrific. The, ah, one of the, ah, best things that ever happened to me was finally our, ah, television equipment business had to close, and, ah, the president of our company, Joe Volpe, ah, instead of looking for a new job, he stayed with the group and made sure every single person in his huge business had a job offer somewhere whether it was inside RCA or from another company, and he never gave up until each person had a job.That says a lot. Any stories you remember or anything that, uh, particularly stick out from...from your experience?Wow. [laughter] One of my favorite stories involves a $2 billion competition for five warships for the country of Norway and, uh, we had this, ah, brilliant engineer who would travel with us to Norway and, uh, the Norwegians were extremely technically oriented but they also had a budget. And, ah, the Norwegian engineers would ask these very, very difficult technical questions, and, ah, so, um, one thing I made sure I did as the leader of the team, uh, trying to win this competition was to make sure I had a, uh, a fairly smart engineer with me to handle the difficult questions.And, we came down to the final meeting where the Norwegians were going to decide between the ship builder and the combat system supplier, the ship builder being the Spanish shipyard Bathan and RCA the supplier of Aegis naval combat systems and a uh, German shipbuilder and, ah, the combat system supplier for that German shipbuilder and, ah...Our chief engineer, Lenny Woyton, got up in front of the Norwegians and, ah, he was trying to paint this, ah, picture of how, ah, we have all these exotic brand new computer programs and state of the art computers, and, that ah, presentation went over very well. Then we went back at night and we had to continue the presentation the next day. We got a phone call from home that said, ah, that US Navy will not let us, uh, use those exotic computers or programs for the Norwegians. They have to use a, ah, much older computer called ANUYK 43.[0:25:39][0:26:17] Male Speaker 2: [0:26:29] Bob Thompson:[END OF TRANSCRIPT]So the next morning, Lenny got up, he went in front of the group and he told them how he had this, uh, good idea overnight to save them some money and use this, uh, very tried and true ANUYK 43 computer to house the very mature computer programs that were in use all over the world. And he never got a question from the Norwegian engineers. They bought it and they gave us this $2 billion contract.That’s classic. I love it. Alright, well that’s good. Um, anything else that, ah, that I haven’t asked or that you have thought of that you want to add to the...The one..The one thing that, ah, I recall was, in the early days, there was so much activity in Camden that it was very hard to drive to work. The roads were clogged. Of course, everybody either came to work at 7:00, 7:30 or 8 o’clock. And, ah, a lot of people had bought homes up in Willingboro, ah, it might have been even called Levittown at that time, and the roads were so clogged that somebody bought a boat and he would take people from the dock here up to Willingboro on the Delaware River in his boat to avoid the traffic jams coming back and forth.
RCAemployee;Bob Reisse;[START OF TRANSCRIPT] [0:00:07] Bob: Yeah. My name is Bob Reisse. I’m from Cherry Hill, New Jersey. I started RCA not as out of college, I started at Bendix Aviation out of college, and I lasted there four months. It was such a boring job that, uh, it was hard to take, and the draft was on. And you, if you quit or drafted for a job, you got, uh, drafted into the Army. And I met a guy on the bus going out, I said, “How do you like your job?” He said, “This is garbage.” And I said, “What can we do?” And he says, “Well, you can join... we can join the navy, go to OCS, and it’s three years. So you lose an extra year, but you’re an officer. You’re getting more pay.” And so that’s what we did. We, uh, went down... we were in New York. We were in downtown New York, and signed up for the, uh, Navy, up in, uh, Newport and, uh, we went up there, and it was four or so months. And then, uh, after graduation, they sent me out to, uh, Treasure Island in California for six months of electronic study, which I learned more there than I did in college. It was, uh, five days a week, eight hours a day. No duties, so we had the weekends off. And we, uh, bought a car, and we used to travel around California, and all the, uh, parks, the national parks and everything, so it was great. And then I had to serve three years in the navy, and I got out in ‘48, I think. Or ‘53, ‘50, um, ‘58 I guess, and I started RCA. I came in, and I think in interviewed with... by Bye Pewitt. I think he was there, Sam, uh, Bye Pewitt, and he was very good. And he hired me, and that’s where I started. And, uh, I was there till GE came in, and GE bought up RCA. And they said... I was near retirement. I was within a year of retiring, and they said, “We’ll give you a year’s pay, and, uh, you could take your lump sum and leave.” And uh, that’s what I did... I [chuckle] it was great. I took the lump sum, and the one year’s pay, and left and uh, it was... it was a good deal. So you started at RCA around ‘58? Yeah. Okay. What was your first project? Oh boy. I... probably just the little amplifiers, and then, ah, then I got into...uh, multipliers started, and I was able to, uh, get a job, uh, in ATL because I said before that the fella I was working for, we built a radio this big, and then we’re gonna make a small box radio. And he [0:01:59] [0:02:44] Male Speaker: [0:02:47] Bob: [0:02:49] Male Speaker: [0:02:50] Bob: [0:04:50] [0:05:17] Male Speaker: [0:05:22] Bob: [0:05:46] Male Speaker: [0:05:49] Bob: called a meeting of... he had seven engineers sitting around and he said, “What color are we gonna make the knobs?”And I said, “I can’t, I can’t work for this guy. It’s gonna be a disaster.” So I was able to go up to Advanced Technology for Max Malchow, and, uh, Max went out to somewhere in the west, and came back, and knew all about multipliers which... varactor multipliers, which was a brand new thing at the time. And he taught us, he gave us the formulas, you look at the diode, you could look at the capacitor, the voltage breakdown, and you could tell how much power it would handle, you could tell the efficiency by the Q of the diode. You could tell everything that was going to come out. And he in the lab ... we spent a couple of months in the lab just building units, not for production, just for test purposes. So we built them, and you measure them, and you could tell that his formulas were correct. The efficiency came out, the power came out, everything was working. So, when I got a... then I got a call back to go back to my old group. And a good engineer, George Inishamore, was working on a multiplier. And he was working on it for about 15, 20 days, and he wasn’t getting anywhere. He was using voltage pump, which Max said you don’t use voltage pump. You got to use a current pump. Instead of putting the diode this way, you put it this way. So, uh, the group leader says, “How long will it take you to make a breadboard?” And I said, “About three hours.” So he says, “Go ahead,” because we... that’s what we were doing for months. We were just doing the same stuff. So I did, and that’s that started the multiplier, uh, game, that worked out. And, uh, then I was the multiplier man for a couple of years. It was very interesting. Do you have mentors? Did you have people looking after you when you first started here? Um, yeah, I’m sure there were. Uh, I think the group leader... I think Bye Pewitt was very good. He was very hands on, very instructional. So, I think he... the group leader usually provided the efforts, yeah. So, what project do you remember the best? Well, I think the , I worked on the TIROS. The first thing was this ... the TIROS Satellite. We put on a beacon transmitter that just... that could locate where it was. And then we went on to the one-man in space, which I think was Mercury. We made the communications or the PA for him. And then the two-man was Gemini. And then the  [0:06:34] Male Speaker: [0:06:38] Bob: [0:07:22] Male Speaker: [0:07:27] Bob: [0:07:38] Male Speaker: [0:07:46] Bob: [0:08:41] Male Speaker: [0:08:46] Bob: space station, I think, was the most interesting, because going to the moon and all this business was very interesting. So, uh, that was, I would say the most interesting job. And what did you do on the lunar projects? Well, the lunar would be the ... well it was all the transmitter. When the... they said when the man walked on the moon and said, “One small step,” we made the PA. And it was in the back of his helmet. And then in the beginning they were worried that the radiation might affect his brain and whatnot, but somehow they got over that. And uh, the PA was right behind his, his left ear, I believe. So he said, “One small step for mankind” and etcetera, and it was very exciting and interesting at the time. Did you have any association when Apollo 13 happened? Uh, no, just... just the news... uh, that was it. No, I had nothing, uh, nothing more than that. As far as your work at RCA, how do you feel the company saw your work? I think uh, I think I was treated very well. I think they, they were very fair. And uh, um, I really had no complaints about RCA. Uh, when GE came in, I... well they gave us the offer to leave, which was terrific. I was near... I was ready. All my kids were... I had six kids, and they were all, they were all through school. So I was ready to take it easy. And they gave us an offer, as I said of the one-year’s pay, and your lump sum you could take. And um, it was a great deal [laugh] so I... I took it, and no, no regrets. What about your colleagues, working with your colleagues? Uh, enjoyed it for the most part. There were a few... there was one fella who, Sam didn’t mention his name and I won’t either, but we used to watch him. He would leave at four o’clock, go to the bar across the street, and we’d look out the window and [chuckle] and watch him. And finally he, he was an electrical engineer. He got out to... they hired him out to Moorestown, and we were happy of that because he was really, uh, just, uh, a drag. And he used to go... at lunchtime, he’d sit at his desk, he’d put a kind of a cone-shaped thing over his head and go to sleep and hope nobody would wake him till five. But uh, he got out to Moorestown, and he, he left secret documents on a bar, and that kind of triggered his [chuckle] the end of his career. They [chuckle] they filed notice against him and they let him go, but um...  [0:09:48] Male Speaker: [0:09:50] Bob: [0:09:51] Male Speaker: [0:09:52] Bob: [0:10:21] Male Speaker: [0:10:25] Bob: [0:11:03] Male Speaker: [0:11:09] Bob: [0:11:37] Male Speaker: [0:11:41] Bob: [0:12:16] Male Speaker: [0:12:20] Bob: But that was one. That was one. What about the rest of your... No um, very, very good. I think they were... it was a good group. We had interesting times, and, uh, not so much outside. I don’t think outside, but at work, uh, pretty much. And they did have uh... well they had ski groups and, you know, they had other little exercises going on, but uh... it was, it was pretty nice, pretty nice. So what was the best thing about working for RCA? Well, what I liked was the 40 hours and not much overtime. Some... there were some groups that they did want all this overtime, and, uh, I didn’t like overtime. I didn’t like coming in Saturdays for four hours, and when you could work eight if you wanted, But, I really liked to keep it... I liked to keep it to the 40 hours straight, uh, so that was the... and they weren’t pushy. If you didn’t want to work overtime you... they let you off a little easier. What was the worst thing about working for RCA? Oh, I can’t think of a negative. Like Bendix Aviation, I could come up with a few of [chuckle] when I started at Bendix Aviation, but RCA was pretty good. They were flexible. If you, if you wanted to go to a, a different group you could, you know, and I was able to do that. And I have no complaints about RCA. I think it was a great, great company. What about RCA’s influence on South Jersey? [Sigh] I don’t know, I... there were a lot of people... there were certainly a lot of people working in Camden, and in Moorestown, and what not, but I think that was it, just providing pay and the benefits for the people. I don’t think they, I don’t think they went out of their way to influence South Jersey. They just wanted a place to build equipment and, uh, get engineers and other people there. So, I don’t think there was a... In your neighborhood, were there other people working for RCA? Uh, yes. I used to drive in with Sam. He was um, probably a half a mile, mile away from me. And I was the driver, but I had a diesel Rabbit. We used to go with the diesel Rabbit, and I’d pick him up, and we’d go into Camden, and because he had uh... Sam always had Lincolns. He liked them big cars [chuckle] but the, uh, economy was  [0:13:01] Male Speaker: [0:13:06] Bob: [0:13:23] Male Speaker: [0:13:28] Bob: [0:13:48] Male Speaker: [0:13:54] Bob: [0:14:30] Male Speaker: [0:14:33] Bob: [0:14:59] Male Speaker: [0:15:06] Bob: [0:15:28] Male Speaker: [0:15:33] Bob: in the [chuckle] diesel Rabbit. So, uh, it got good mileage and not much problems with it. So, you didn’t spend much time with your coworkers outside of work? Uh, I would say not, no, because by... you know when we got married, then we had six kids, and that keeps you pretty busy, uh, without getting into too much other... [chuckle] With reference to the RCA family, what’s that mean to you? Well, to me it was just the, the group you work with basically. That, that was it. The uh, the family was just the fellas or the group that you were mainly with. Uh, that’s to me, that’s what it was. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. So, how would you sum up your experience? I, uh, I enjoyed it. I, uh... the, the work was very interesting. The pay was good. The hours were good. Uh, the vacation time, I got... I ended up with four weeks at the... towards the end of my career. Four weeks was a good vacation time, and you were able to take it. They didn’t nitpick when you, you know, half a day here or half a day there. They let you take the time off so it was good, wonderful. How did your kids view your job at RCA? I think, I think they enjoyed that it was secure. I think they enjoyed that my wife kept them busy and, uh, fed, and all that [chuckle]. And, you, know were able to relax and have a good time. And we’d... swimming pool and all that business. So, I think they were happy. They still speak to us [chuckle]. So, would you sum this up by saying, well, this was just a job, or was this a good journey, or how would you... I think it was a very good job. It was interesting. Uh, that first job I had was boring at Bendix Aviation. That was boring and that’s a tough, that’s a tough way to go through a week with a boring job. This was always interesting, interesting work and, uh, good people, so it was great. Did you notice a change in environment with the GE takeover? Yes, I think the... GE came in, and the first thing they wanted to do was, uh, get rid of people. They came in, and they had their own engineering group doing similar work. So they bought... I think they bought, they bought RCA just to get the television part of RCA. They didn’t need the engineering part because they had it. So their big  [0:16:29] Male Speaker: [0:16:33] Bob: [0:17:02] Male Speaker: [0:17:04] Bob: [0:17:06] Male Speaker: [0:17:09] Bob: [0:17:11] Male Speaker: [0:17:14] Bob: thing, as soon as they came in, they wanted to shrink the engineering department and... uh, which turned out to be an opportunity because they... if you wanted to leave, they would give you a year’s pay and, um, if you were in the right position, you could go right into retirement, so... and I was in that position. So it was it was terrific [chuckle]. It worked out great. Anything you want to add to uh, the story, Bob? No, I, uh... the work was always interesting, and that’s the main thing. You’re going in there for 40 hours or so, and you want an interesting job, and it was... uh, the work was interesting and you could... if you wanted to switch positions, if you didn’t like what you were doing there, if it got boring, you could go down and you had to see the manager or the chief engineer, but you could go somewhere else and, uh, that was a good opportunity. This one small step for a man... Mm-hmm. You made that radio, the PA. I made the, the PA, yes. How did you feel when he, when he was doing it? Well, I think we were... [chuckle] we wanted to make sure it worked. He had, he had uh, I think, backups. He had, I think two backups beside the main one. So, we were kind of confident. The, the first thing though, uh, with NASA... maybe I told you, I think. They, uh, were so crazy in the beginning. They wanted to make sure all the parts were high reliable. They wanted to look at the sand before they made the transistors. They wanted to know everything. And we couldn’t get anything out the door because they had so many tests. None of the parts would last through the tests. You had all these tests that we couldn’t get any parts to use because everything failed. So finally NASA said, uh, “Forget that, give us your best shot.” And then we were able to make a radio. I mean, the parts were reliable, but if you’d put enough, uh, sanctions on them, enough tests, you can break anything. So, once they relaxed, and we had like, a couple of backups... they didn’t have just one radio, they had backups. So everything worked out, uh, fine. Uh, we didn’t have... I don’t believe we had a... we might’ve had one failure but not... it was nothing, uh, nothing big. Okay, very good. [0:18:40] Male Speaker:  [0:18:43] Bob: [0:18:46] Male Speaker: [0:18:52] Bob: [0:19:00] Male Speaker: [0:19:02] Bob: [0:19:06] Male Speaker: [0:19:08] Bob: Was an interesting time [chuckle]. Good. All right, Bob. Well, I appreciate you taking your time out for this. This is important to get all of the story down. Mm-hmm. Yeah, it was a good, a good company and uh, very interesting people too. We met some very interesting people. Yeah. I told you about Max Malchow [chuckle] that’s a... that’s my... You told them. Tell me. Yeah. Well, I um, when uh, the guy wanted me to... we were going to build a small box and uh, he wanted to know what color we were gonna make the knobs. I got out, and they put me up with Max. And Max was, he looked like a farmer, but he was the smartest guy I’ve ever met there. He taught us the multipliers, varactor multipliers. And I told you he gave us the formulas. How much power it could handle, how... what the efficiency would be, everything. So, then when I got back and built that first multiplier that went into production, it was, it was great and uh, he just... he gave you all the knowledge you needed, and that was a wonderful thing. But, he was a good man. [END OF TRANSCRIPT]
RCAemployee;Bob Paglee;Bob: I’m M. Robert Paglee. I don’t use my first name I like to be called just simply Bob. I was born in Europe in 1924, a good year. Both my parents were citizens and my mother brought me as a baby back to the U.S. I was her second child. First one was born Evinston, Illinois. I came along and was born in Europe and she brought me back when I was just a baby, two years old or so. Anyway, I joined RCA after I graduated from Purdue in October of 1944. I was one of those students that was on accelerated program so I got my degree in about 2 1⁄2 years. Of course, I’m practically blind in this eye from a childhood injury. I wasn't drafted and my RCA came along and interviewed me and offered a trip to the East Coast to take a look at the place. so I decided to join up. I was 20 years old at that time. Actually, my father had to sign for me my application to RCA because I was not of age, of legal age. [0:02:00] Anyway, I started in December of 1944 and down in Camden. It was with the Service Company who said they would send me around the world so I thought, “This is great. I could do my thing.” Indeed I did. It didn’t take long to put me into a program RCA was building a thing called a JT, which is a sonic listening device used on submarines to get data into, directional data, into the submarine target data computer which then sends a fish to its destination. The idea is that they listen to this cavitation noise caused by screws and this thing had- this was an RCA design with a synchronous detector so that they could have a meter that showed when it’s right on target. It was center scale but as you move you may work to handle to work the servo that rotated this thing. There was a big hydrophone above the submarine. To center the needle on this sound was a far more accurate system than its predecessor which was merely to get the maximum sound. To find the peak of a signal that’s wrong is difficult. If you can by having two hydrophones and doing the sum and differencing to find the null , they got a very accurate bearing on the compass. RCA sent me to submarine school in New London, Connecticut for I think it was a two week crash course. We had some trips on a yacht called the duck. It was actually Joe Penner’s yacht and Joe Penner is the guy that came up with that thing. If it looks like a duck and walks like a duck then it must be a duck. That was Joe Penner. We had some experience there off the coast of Connecticut in trying to learn how some of these things- anyway, it didn’t take long before the RCA put me in officer’s uniform and sent me to order to the submarine base on Midway Island, Gooney Bird heaven. There we took care of the submarines as they came in for refit or whatever problems they were having. It was very small. It’s not a big place, Midway Island. Actually, there’s two islands in the lagoon and the main submarine base was the one on what would be the western island. The East island was just a knoll. [0:09:45] Gwen: [0:09:47] Bob: What was his name? Famous humorist Anyway, they came. They crushed and there’s a thing there where a monument on the shore of the- I guess that would be the-I think that’s the Bearing Sea at that point. After that, I thought it would be interesting to get into other things. After we’ve started working for the as a sales representative for the RCA TV, and radio, transmitters, antennas, studio equipment came with all the stuff that went in to the TV station and I did sell one station in Memphis. The things were very difficult because the freeze was on. FCC was trying to decide how close together they could put these TV stations and not have co-channel interference, or adjacent channel interference. After some difficulties early on, they put a freeze on building more TV stations. That shut the whole activity and RCA was really hurt at that point with this broadcast division. At that point, I got sent on a contract with the State Department for instructing the European the countries in NATO on modern weapons and radar computers, aircraft artillery which most that was the only thing that was active for countermeasures. In the process, I started out in Belgium but it got so miserable up there with all rain in cold weather on lousy and so I Anyway, after the war ended, I was there when the war ended and the war in Japan ended and we had a little celebration on BOQ and had quite a time with a tour around the island in a commandeered weapons carrier. After that, I came back to New Jersey. Let’s see, I guess one of the next things RCA put me into was a trip to Point Barrow, Alaska. RCA had a contract to develop an underwater sonic transducer system what was like a mini radar system to measure the thickness of the ice in the arctic environment. This was in support of actually the navy and was Navy Petroleum Reserve at 4. They were doing exploratory work there with drilling wells, big wells, deep wells in order to try to find out what liquid black gold there was in Alaska for the navy. It’s a very complicated thing but from Point Barrow, they would organize what’s called a cat train. It was a big diesel caterpillar diesel that pulled a whole series of well cats then two or three. Each one had a couple sleds, the great big sleds. Sled as big as this room. Unless they may had oil, barrels and oil machinery and all kind of stuff that they had to take the forward location where they were drilling for oil. We had to measure the thickness of the ice. But the trouble is the ice was so flawed that it was impossible to get an accurate measurement. In a way the job turned out to be a lot of information about ice and not a system that would work. I think since they may have now of the new systems that do work in that fashion but in those days it was tough. I would go out on the ice with- I had a vehicle that had been rigged up with a power generator and stuff and we could do some testing. There were a couple of Navy guys that were assigned to work for me and we took a lot of data and we’re out and did a lot of interesting things in one weekend we took a trip to Wylie Post had come down with his Wylie post and-  [0:12:54] Gwen: [0:13:02] Bob: [0:13:54] Interviewer: [0:14:00] Gwen: asked for a transfer and got shipped to Rome. That was really great because that’s where I met Gwen. We were married there by a- Paulist priest, James Cunningham, Santa Suzanna American church for Americans living in Rome and it was quite a number of people there that went into that church. Father Cunningham fixed it so we could get married in Vatican City because to get married in Rome, which is part of Italy, is a very complicated affair, but to get married in Vatican City, was a breeze. Well, comparatively so. In fact, one of my buddies there got married at the city hall in Rome and Gwen and I were there for witnesses. That was a nightmare. In all the places we had to go to get them. Anyway, we got married in St. Peters. You don’t speak with an Italian accent. What were you doing over in Italy? I went over with a college friend and then her mother came over and we had an apartment in Rome. Her voice teacher was an American who, an Italian American, who would spend one year in New York and one year in Rome. This was the year to go to Rome. My family, I being an only an child, they said, “Okay, that’s all right if you go.” That’s how it happened and about two months later I met Bob Paglee at La Fiammetta, which was a movie theatre that showed American movies. It was a great place for romance. My parents didn’t meet him. I went home to get my truso. You young people don’t know what that is, but the wedding dress and all the new clothes that’s called a truso. We did it in three days at Marshal feild and company in Chicago. My parents and I sailed back on the Liberte, and that’s when they first met Pag. They didn’t know him until the week before the wedding and we’ve been married for 62 years. One of the reasons I didn’t come to the U.S. to meet the parents, it was a kind of weird thing. In those days, the U.S. was trying to entice people to go oversees and stay there and help the European economy whatever. They had a thing if you stayed for, I think it was 541 days, then come back, from that point on your income tax was forgiven. No income tax. That was a very- The incentive to stay there. For about five years. If I had come back even for one day, it would kill a thing and I’d have to start the 541 days over again. [0:15:18] Bob: [0:16:07] Gwen: [0:16:10] Bob:  [0:16:24] Gwen: [0:16:46] Bob: [0:16:46] Gwen: [0:16:49] Bob: [0:16:50] Gwen: Our daughter was born there three years later, and we came back to the states when she was a year old. I would also add that my husband speaks Italian like a true Roman. They thought he was a native. They thought, absolutely, his Italian is so excellent. Not really. Yes it is. It was. They thought I was a hillbilly. No, they didn’t. And our Ann, who is a graphic designer, and now lives in Portland, Oregon, she went back. She had a semester, she was at Temple, and she had a semester in Rome. She met, my husband is a hand radio operator, and he would speak every Sunday to this Italian dentist, Franco Angelone, every Sunday. We said to Franco, “Ann is coming. We hope you can meet her.” They adopted her. She’s their American daughter. She and her husband even went sailing on their honeymoon there. So Ann speaks Italian like a Roman. RCA. Anyway, we came back- Now, with the RCA story. Go ahead. Well, RCA is what really married us in a way. I married RCA, and then I married her on account of RCA. Anyway, we came back and I went to work in Moorestown for what was called Missile and Surface Radar. And what’s involved with mainly the precision tracking radars that we were building here in Moorestown. It was the ANFPS 16. There was a whole family of these things. The ANFPS 16, the ANFPQ6, TPQ18, et cetera. There was a whole series of these. These radars were fantastic. It was instrumentation radars that were as accurate as.... We advertised them to a tenth of a mil precision. Accuracy is something else. Accuracy depends on your alignment and on how you have it oriented. Precision was tenth of a mil which was exception on those days. What year was this that you came back to Moorestown? ‘58 No, ’56, 1956. I did a lot of the pioneering work with these radars. I wrote some of those things that I was showing you nomographs, and I wrote a couple of the articles for the RCA engineer. Maybe someday I’ll find where I hid the thing. I think I saved it somewhere. If I find it I’ll give it to you. Anyway, we put these radars all over the world because we were trying to support the nice man-in-space program. One of the radars that I was particularly interested in was the one on Kawaii. I actually sited the I picked site with the help of an instrument that came from Pearl Harbor with the [0:17:36] Bob: [0:17:40] Interviewer: [0:17:44] Bob: [0:19:07] Interviewer: [0:19:10] Gwen: [0:19:12] Bob:  [0:21:19] Interviewer: [0:21:26] Bob: operator, the fellow that knew how to- it was an altitude thing because Kawai was- we wanted to find the right spot to put that radar so that we would pick up the capsules that came around the world. We would have preferred, there was a spot that I would have preferred but they won’t let me pick that because the state, Kawai had its own smaller radar up there that was- It was like the contest between the federal government and the state government? The state government won and we didn’t put exactly where I would have preferred. We picked a good spot for it anyway. That was basically what I have been doing all the way up until recently in more recent until the time I retired I was the manager of the AEGIS signal processor design and development. The AEGIS system is a very complex affair that is the current of the modern U.S. Navy to be able to launch all kinds of rockets and anti aircraft type stuff and the missiles and now it’s been developed into anti ballistic missile system which is going to be very interesting. They are trying to put couple on over in Europe, but I’m not involved with that anymore. I’m retired and so I just try to keep up with what’s happening. We had an arranged tour of the Combat Engineering, CSED System Engineering Development site here in Moorestown for the IEEE bunch. This was about two or three months ago. Yeah, it was just this year. Let’s talk about RCA now. You didn’t mention any of your coworkers. What were they like? Great guys. The RCA family in fact we still are. I go once a month to a luncheon that we have for the signal processor group. Sometimes I go for the- there’s another one that’s the microwave group and the mechanical engineers are part of that. We still have a very tight retirement group and it’s- RCA was one of the most unusual , I thought friendly, and trying to bring engineers into a social environment as well as a technical environment, RCA had lots of opportunities for study. I had took a course at the Villanova, it’s a mathematics course. I also took a lot of afterhours courses right in our plant here in Moorestown that were given by engineering specialist to bring the rest of engineering community up to snuff in that particular discipline. So it’s very interesting. RCA is a fantastic, friendly kind of thing. You use the term that sounds almost like a slogan, the RCA family. What’s that mean to you? Family is like this: We are married together. I’m trying to describe it was such a tightly, knit, both technically and socially. I don’t mean that we had social events, the special stuff except the retirement suppers and every time I guess every five years you get another tie clip or sets of top pen and pencil. [0:23:26] Interviewer: [0:23:41] Bob: [0:25:36] Interviewer: [0:25:44] Bob:  [0:27:25] Interviewer: [0:27:34] Bob: [0:28:19] Interviewer: [0:28:28] Bob: [0:29:20] Gwen: 0:29:22] Bob: [0:29:33] interviewer: [0:29:37] Bob: It was never any big thing out of this. It was just being friendly. RCA had an environment that was, I thought, unique in that world. I've seen quite a few others in my various, because I’ve, RCA sent me a lot of different places and I see the world in a way. I have always thought RCA was absolutely unique in the way it treated its employee’s and particularly the professional people. Okay. It sounds to me like you felt like RCA valued you as a contributor and you were just an employee? Always amazingly friendly. It’s hard to describe. I guess I was 43 years up to the time I retired. That’s a long time to work for one company. People don’t do that today, hardly. But I think they still do it here in Moorestown. I see some of the guys who retire and come to these luncheons. They’re still very much a family here. What about the influence of RCA on South Jersey? Do you have any opinions on that? Well, I think it’s between the Camden Plant, the Moorestown Plant, and the Heightstown, Princeton. Well, there was a RCA lab at Princeton. In fact, that was another one- the RCA lab in Princeton donated to your competitor at TCNJ, The College of New Jersey. I had an IEEE tour earlier this year. It’s an interesting place. They have a lot of RCA- Memorabilia Memorabilia on a wall panel all around the big room. Have you ever been up there to the-? Yes, we did. We went up and visited that. One of the interesting things about the RCA groupings of point factors and enterprises in South Jersey at least in the engineering community, I’m not so sure about the factors with the hourly workers have quite that privileges. The engineering things we had opportunities. If the business in Moorestown fell off and the business in Camden was thriving, we would farm out engineers from this location to that location. As a manager, I had the unfortunate need to lay off people on occasion. I think it was only two occasions in all my experience that we had a problem where we had to lay off a few people and that’s a very heartbreaking activity. We managed to avoid a lot of that because of the interconnection of RCA Camden, RCA Moorestown, even the broadcast division. When that went out of business it was originally in Camden, I guess, then it went out to the Gibbsboro what they call the paint factory that they had turned into a modernized and turned into a factory which was a busy building stuff for the broadcast TV stations. That business went down hill when Japanese, we couldn’t compete with the Japanese on price. I wasn’t really involved in that  [0:33:01] Interviewer: [0:33:18] Bob: [0:34:35] Gwen: [0:34:40] Interviewer: [0:34:46] Gwen: [0:35:05] Bob: [0:35:06] Gwen: [0:35:10] Bob: [0:35:14] Gwen: [0:35:16] Bob: [0:35:24] Interviewer: [0:35:28] Bob: [0:36:09] Interviewer: [0:36:19] Bob: [0:36:24] Gwen: [0:36:27] Bob: [0:36:34] Interviewer: except for one thing. When that enterprise had to fold up, I was able to bring in some engineers from there and I placed them in jobs here at Moorestown where we needed more people. This happened quite- well, not terribly frequently, but frequently enough that it really made a difference. We didn’t have such a turnover of people. We tried to hang on to the talented people and professionals. So you were quite well travelled. What do you think of the assessment of the RCA standing in industry? How did other technical people view RCA? Oh, I think it was a- I remember a guy at Wallops Island one of the Wallops Island radars there on the beach and another one further inland. Anyway, one of the government engineers I was familiar with used to kid me about this. He said RCA is the, I forget now. An ad for whatever it was- doing hair or something. He thought RCA is you guys keep thinking that you are the tops, and we were. He would kid me about that. I can’t remember now the name of that. You never told me that story. I can’t help. As Bob’s wife, what was your impression of the RCA family? They were like family. He was home for lunch every day. Boy, you can’t get any better than that. In fact, at one point he brought all the engineers. Fortunately, I had fore knowledge about that. Only we have a patio out here who went- That was at the other house. That was on Edgemore Drive. We have it here too. We were very fortunate. We’ve lived in Moorestown since we came back from Europe in 1956. How about your supervisors, what was your impression of that? Always very helpful trying to help me improve. I never had any conflict. We all got along very well. I thought generally they went out of their way. Well I did too to try to make things as pleasant and as efficient as we could. Let’s step back and sum up your career at RCA, just a job? Not a job. It was a life. Its his calling. It was a life, and a wonderful one. Have we left out any stories?  [0:36:40] Gwen: [0:36:46] Bob: [0:36:50] Gwen: [0:36:52] Bob: [0:36:55] Gwen: [0:37:07] Bob: [0:37:42] Gwen: [0:37:45] Bob: [0:38:01] Gwen: [0:38:02] Bob: [0:38:03] Gwen: [0:38:04] Bob: [0:38:27] Gwen: [0:38:27] Bob: [0:39:13] Gwen: [0:39:15] Bob: [0:39:38] Gwen: [0:39:40] Bob: About in Rome when the Purdue GleeClub came. Yeah. Miss money Penny? Yes. Do you remember, what was her name? The actress in the James Bond movie, Miss Money Penny. She’s Canadian and she had moved in that very night right next door to us. We had two apartments on that floor. Our door was here, her door was there. This was at the end of a corridor. As the Purdue Glee Club was- well, I was involved with that back in the days when I was a tenor. They have a overseas thing for- A tour, singing. Well, at the UN food and agriculture affair there in Rome. I invited them to come and they said they would if they could and they did. After the concert. After the concert. Lois Maxwell. Lois Maxwell, yes. Anyway, they drove up to the front of this fancy apartment building where we were and actually they were condominiums but we were renting one. Then all these guys in white tux- very fancy dress. Plaid cumber buns. They all filed out of this bus and they tried as many could get into the elevator but the elevator were not that big so they went up four flights of stairs. They came running up the stairs, and they went running into our apartment. Dozens of these guys were entering the door. Lois Maxwell opened her door and said, “Shhh,” she must have thought these ... into a mad house. Then they started singing. Yeah. I had rented a piano. I was assigned to the embassy in Brussels and in Rome. We had access to all kinds of great things at very reasonable prices. At the PX. Well whatever... I got a couple of cases of beer, put them in the bathtub along with a couple bunches of ice. This was all ready for these guys. They were having a good big time singing.  [0:40:04] Gwen: [0:40:07] Bob: [0:40:37] Gwen: [0:40:38] Bob: [0:40:41] Gwen: [0:40:54] Bob: [0:41:09] Interviewer: [0:41:21] Bob: [0:41:26] Interviewer: [0:41:33] Bob: Tell them about the balcony. Yes. A bunch of them went to crowd. We had a cantilevered balcony. It wasn’t a big balcony. Just say from here to the wall. I was worried. There was all a bunch of guys on the balcony. I was worried about whether the darn thing would break off or. It didn’t. I shoo them off so that only a few of them could stay. It was memorable. Lois Maxwell, her first night in this apartment, right next door to us. You can imagine our feelings. All is racket, the music was piano pounding. I guess a bunch had been 50 voices singing and Gwen singing and it was quite an affair. Okay. What was the best thing about working for RCA? Being appreciated. I think that was the best. What was the worst thing about working for RCA? Disappointment. For instance, when we ... that ice measuring device that had me go to Alaska. This was a Navy contract. They designed it in Camden, and the Camden ice company, I don’t know if you are familiar with it. They would make this great big ice 500 pound ice. They would take these things into the lab in Camden and they would use this to test the device. Of course with this beautiful ice that came out of a ice factory, the thing worked perfectly. I thought, well, we better be sure I go all the way up to Alaska I want to see if we can test it in the real world here. So we went over. One of these just the other side of the river- it’s a fancy hotel on lake and the lake was frozen over and I said we would go and test this things on that lake so we did. Indeed, the problem was when we went out on the lake, it didn’t work. There were too many flaws in the ice. It was impossible in the real world to make it work. We also went into a boat house which was covered over. The ice was solid under there and we tested it there and it worked nicely but just the same as it worked in the lab. In a way, this was my biggest disappointment that we had developed this thing. I really was not in on the original design of it. I just was dragged into to do the testing. I thought this was not a viable product. I thought we should just cancel the contract and say, “Well, we tried.” Well RCA didn’t want to do that because I had a contract. They had money. The contract said you got to go test in Alaska. I told them, “Well, I’ll go but I think we shouldn’t because it’s expensive.” When I got there it was black. There was no sun. Around noon time there would be a little bit of yellow on the horizon like at night here but it was black. It was the 24 hour.  [0:45:33] Gwen: [0:45:35] Bob: [0:45:40] Gwen: [0:45:41] Bob: It was depressing. No, it was interesting. You like sun. I had fun with that. Actually, at one point we put our equipment including what do they call it. It was almost like a weasel tracked vehicle. I think it was a weasel maybe it was called. It had a cab on it which was warm. Of course it had the power generator. We put that on an airplane at Point Barrow and we flew it to Umiat. Umiat is like the end of the world. There was a Umiat had one time was a bustling place where they had drilled a deep well nearby. Now, there was nothing there but it was on a Caldwell river. This was another test that I had to do to find out how this measuring machine would work on a Caldwell river because that was a problem that they had to cope with when they would run these big cap trains up the river early now and then they find because the underwater, the rocks on water would cause the currents to eat away some of the ice. The ice might be three feet thick generally. In spots it might be just a few inches thick. Every now and then one of these great bulldozer caterpillar train things would break through and would have to rest and there was a big problem there on the Caldwell river in the middle of nowhere had to try to rescue the thing and get this thing out of there, the big heavy machine. I went down there to try it on the ice and I found the same thing, and it didn’t work there either. I got out of the cab of this weasel then I went up the hill, and I go into this oil well building. It was so cold. I guess they had to build a building around the derrick. There was this gigantic- the thing was as big as this house with a big derrick in the middle and a huge machine in the bottom and generators, all these stuff, all idle because the job was over. It was such a difficult place to get in and out of even though this was pretty expensive machinery, they had to abandon it there and out probably it still there.
RCAemployee;Bob Holston;[0:00:06] Bob Holston: I started at RCA in March of 1958. I had spent the previous year testing large liquid propelled rocket engines out in the Santa Susana Mountains in California, and I moved back to New Jersey and started at RCA. March of ’58 and I spent about 35 years there, all in Camden. Worked with the digital airborne, digital equipment design group and I was basically a mechanical engineer. Although I did go to graduate school at night and got two additional degrees, masters degrees, one in electrical engineering and one in aeronautical engineering. I retired in ’94 and continued to do all the things I like to do. Remodeling around the house, building train displays and taking great trips with my wife... Great... ... to various places in the world. What was the first project you worked on at RCA? It was a digital communications system for the 100 series fighter planes. I would provide direction to a target from the ground controller and I did the mechanical design. Back thenwe used small little packets of circuits which would hold two transistors and now you can put thousands of those on a chip, of course... Right. And, I worked on that. I did some of the system work on that, developing the test messages for the equipment. When you got your first assignment did they give you any sort of a mentor or anybody to oversee what you were doing? Not really, being a mechanical engineer in a group of electrical engineers is a unique experience. You run into three different kinds of people. You run into electrical engineers that don’t know anything about mechanical engineering. You run into some that know a lot about mechanical engineering and you run into some that think they know a lot about mechanical engineering. So once you get to learn to work with these folks, it all works out very well. We accomplished the purpose of the projects. Were there any particular instances you remember about these engineers dealing with the new guy on the block? [0:01:05] Speaker 1: [0:01:06] Bob Holston: [0:01:07] Speaker 1: [0:01:10] Bob Holston: [0:01:43] Speaker 1: [0:01:43] Bob Holston: [0:01:53] Speaker 1: [0:02:01] Bob Horton: [0:02:36] Speaker 1: [0:02:43] Bob Horton: [0:03:13] Speaker 1: [0:03:15] Bob Horton: [0:03:33] Speaker 1: [0:03:33] Bob Horton: Everybody was always very cooperative. Being at RCA was like a family. There was always somebody you could go to, ask them about something or “Hey, I heard so and so worked on something like that”, they’ll give him a call and that’s the way that information got passed around informally, for Information that you might need to develop the product that you were working on. Everybody was very cooperative and friendly. Ok. So, after that project, where did you go? I went with the ATL people on classified projects for several years and that all turned out good. That’s all we can talk about on that. That’s all you can say about it, right. The most exciting part was the stuff we did for the space program. They got a little group together that developed the communications systems for the lunar rover. We had an electronics package, we had to provide for that, the antenna, the camera and we could do voice, data and video from the buggy back down to the earth. That worked out well, of course. Princeton built a camera for us and Moorestown did the final detail design on the antenna, although we came up with the concepts, and then in Camden we developed the basic mechanical package which contained all the electronics and the thermal control systems on that. But, it was really great to work on the project and then go home someday and turn on your television and say: “Hey, there’s something that I just designed or I designed that two months ago. Very rewarding experience and, plus, we could talk about it. I imagine the environmental requirements were a lot more stringent than the other projects. Well, standard space requirements, you know, you’re working in a vacuum, and NASA was very cautious about what they required us to be able to perform in. We used to design equipment to harsh environments and some of the things had to be extended and it worked well. We even took one of our test chambers down in the environmental test lab in Camden and filled the whole floor with some custom made sand that NASA had specified for us. And then, we could put our equipment in there and start pouring bits of the sand over the intricate mechanisms of the antenna and everything else to make sure that stuff could work on the dusty moon surface. They were very thorough in what they wanted and we certainly followed through on it. [0:04:38] Speaker 1: [0:04:43] Bob Horton:  [0:05:45] Speaker 1: [0:05:48] Bob Horton: [0:06:34] Speaker 1: [0:06:40] Bob Horton: Okay. When you were working in what I imagine, in a pretty close- knit team at that point. Yes. We had our engineering leader was Mr. Jack Conley, and I had the mechanical engineer working with me. And then we had the guys from ATL help us with the thermal design, because they had some computer programs that could do some of that kind of analysis and it worked well. Of course, everybody got active participation. The program manager wanted all the engineers that were doing anything to stand up and present their story directly to the customer. So that really motivated people to do their job and to do it well, we appreciated that. Did you ever have to go down to any of the places where they were doing this. Yes, we went on a regular basis down to Houston for regular reviews, and did presentations, explained the status of the job, and so we had lots of viewgraphs. I had a good artist at RCA that did a lot of good illustrations of different movements and things like that by the astronauts to handle the equipment. That was Jim Burns. That turned out well because that helped communicate what the equipment was. And, of course, we had a mayor review down in Florida with the actual crew to make sure that they could handle everything, mount it, dismount it, operate doors and antennas and things like that. We worked directly with them. The two astronauts in that were Jim Irwin and David Scott. David Scott was the command pilot for the Apollo XV. What was that like? Well, NASA is very thorough. They had a very good quality control system. You’d take any piece of equipment into a facility or building, whether you were delivering it or not made no difference. It went in there, it got registered, it got put on a table and the quality people inspected it and gave you a report. Whether you were just bringing it down for in process show or not, it didn’t make any difference. Anything that walked in that facility got inspected. I think that works out in the long run, because It benefited everybody and the success of the program. What was the perception of RCA by these external people? Always got very good feelings from the NASA people. They had a lot of respect for our program manager. Sam Holt was the business area manager for that part of the business and he had a lot of [0:07:44] Speaker 1: [0:07:45] Bob Horton: [0:08:26] Speaker1: [0:08:32] Bob Horton:  [0:09:09] Speaker 1: [0:09:12] Bob Horton: previous experience with NASA. It was a good, solid relationship. There was never any kind of conflicts or problems. Were you involved at all with the Apollo XIII issue? Yes, I can tell you an interesting story about that. Actually, not the equipment itself or the event, but is so happened that when Apollo XIII was in the accident mode and they were trying to return to the Earth, we were having a meeting with our NASA people with regard to what we were going to do on Apollo XV for the lunar rover. I remember our meeting was interrupted and the NASA engineer said come on down the hall and into the recording room and you can listen to Houston talking to the two astronauts that were on their way back to the Earth, right? And everybody’s praying that they make it, which they did, of course. That was very exciting and it sends the chills up your back when you listen to these guys talking at this very sensitive time in the history of the flight. Of course, the other thing was, our boss was very demanding and we had to work late that night and we missed the big celebration party at the hotel for the safe landing of the astronauts. By the time we got back to the hotel, all this broken glasses and paper cups lying around, and it was very quiet. We missed the best party of the year, I think. But, we did our job. The reputation that we have uncovered so far is that the RCA people, they worked really hard and they also played pretty hard. Do you have anything to say about that? Not really. We were always busy working, because we had a very short schedule. In fact, I think that maybe initially NASA wasn’t quite sure they’d be able to get that system together to be able to fly it on Apollo XV, maybe just later. Because they only had two more... three flights, XV, XVI and XVII left. But we got it done to their schedule and it worked fine. We were very proud of that fact and I was fortunate that my supervisor put me in for an award, The Engineer of the Month Award, I received that. So, I was very happy about that. So what were your co-workers like? Co-workers were fine, just ordinary, good-natured folks doing their job. One guy, the number one program manager said one time, “You know, engineers are too honest.” Well, they are honest and that’s what makes them good engineers and there were never any problems associated with that. How did you feel about your career, about whether RCA appreciated you, your progression? [0:10:45] Speaker 1: [0:10:58] Bob Horton: [0:11:42] Speaker 1: [0:11:43] Bob Horton: [0:12:12] Speaker 1:  [0:12:23] Bob Horton: Well, we had reviews and when I got into, later on, into the program where we were developing the satellite terminals, the ground stations for the army, I didn’t like some of the mechanical things that they were doing, and I got to be a complainer, and my boss Bob Lawton , I think he was tired of hearing that and said, okay, you be the mechanical leader, because they really didn’t have a mechanical leader. So I said, okay, I’ll do that job. So, I appreciated that and I was supported by the management of what we were trying to do and accomplished things. Okay. There has also been some reference to people’s opinions that RCA actually changed South Jersey. Do you have any opinions on that? Not really. I know when I initially started there in Camden, there were something like 6,000 employees, because they were still doing some commercial television manufacturing and the studio equipment development at that time in 10 and 13 building. It was about over 6,000 employees. That’s a lot of people coming in and avail themselves to the service of the city as required, yes. What about the neighborhood, where there other RCA people living... Where I lived throughout South Jersey you could always find a couple of other RCA people in the neighborhood, absolutely. Definitely. So, as far as the environment of the workplace, was it a drudge, was it something that you got up in the morning and looked forward to? I always felt happy to go to work in the morning and I had a great carpool situation for about 15 years. I rode to work with John Pope and he and I both liked to get in early and we both left at a reasonable time after five o’clock. He enjoyed his work tremendously because he had to coordinate between manufacturing and engineering and get everybody to like him and to like each other. I got to go to work every morning with a diplomat and he would discuss his jobs and all that and he was filled with enthusiasm. A lot of that rubbed off on me. He had this big smile, when he got to the door and parked the car, he said, “let’s go and get them Bob!” And that’s what we did. It was a pleasure working with John. You mentioned that that you got some other degrees. Was RCA influential on that? [0:13:13] Speaker 1: [0:13:31] Bob Horton: [0:14:02] Speaker 1: [0:14:07] Bob Horton: [0:14:20] Speaker 1: [0:14:32] Bob Horton: [0:15:35] Speaker 1:  [0:15:46] Bob Horton: [0:16:12] Speaker 1: [0:16:16] Bob Horton: [0:16:51] Speaker 1: [0:16:52] Bob Horton: [0:17:04] Speaker 1: [0:17:11] Bob Horton: [0:17:45] Speaker 1 [0:17:52] Bob Horton: [0:18:27] Speaker 1: [0:18:30] Bob Horton: I was just interested in broadening my capability and so I took advantage of the program. They paid for the tuition, you went at night and that was that. I had a better understanding of what the electrical people were doing as a result of some of the educational experiences. Okay, good. So, what was the best about working for RCA? The best thing of working for RCA was the fact that I met my beautiful wife of 54 years at RCA. I was a widower with two small children and it turned out that she was a good friend of a fellow that was one of my fraternity brothers when I was in college, unbeknownst to me. She was sitting there, in the next room and she’s the greatest thing from RCA. She was working there also? Yes, she worked in visitor security, she worked with personnel, and things like that. We hear a lot of reference about the RCA family. What does that mean to you? Well, it’s the way people work with each other. It’s not a demographic per se, it’s how they cooperate with each other, how they treat each other, how they share information with each other as required. You always felt that you could find somebody that it they had something similar, that would talk to you and if it got to be too big a deal they would ask to charge your shop order for that time. It was a very cooperative environment. If I had to ask you about the worst thing about working for RCA, what would that be? I guess getting caught in the floods on Admiral Wilson Boulevard in the spring when the heavy rains came. You were always worried whether your engine exhaust is going to get under the water when you’re trying to get out onto Admiral Wilson to get home. And the parking lot was there but it was kind of messy. But that’s not the RCA itself, that’s the neighborhood. How would you sum up your career at RCA? I felt fulfilled and I'll point out why, I was a great science fiction reader back in the 40’s. My father was, too. And he encouraged me in scientific things and he also was interested in science fiction and he wrote a lot of science fiction. And I look back with the work I did on the moon project for the lunar rover, that was science fiction  [0:19:15] Speaker 1 [0:19:22] Bob Horton: [END OF TRANSCRIPT] back in the 40’s. It’s amazing I can look over at my career and say I went from science fiction to science reality. That gives you a very warm feeling, a sense of accomplishment. Are there any other stories or anything you can recall about either your work or the people or incidents that happened? Well, there were always the standard jokes, the elevators were always breaking down because the buildings were old, they were built in 1921, the ten and thirteen building. And so, it was always a good conversation piece. Like, if you’d get in the elevator in the morning and everybody would smile and say, well, I wonder if we’re going to get up there today. But we had a good crew of elevator repairmen, which kept those things going. That sort of thing was prominent.
RCAemployee;Bill Baney;[0:00:08] Bill Baney: Alright, my name is Bill Baney, I started with RCA in November of 1960 in Camden, New Jersey. I arrived on the scene at the bright age of 24, had a wife, new baby, and one on the way. And I was most impressed by RCA in the size of that location at the time. Which I think it’s between 17 and 18 thousand in employees. Huge. My position was in, then called the personnel department, now human resources as an interviewer. My... The location consisted then of RCA corporate offices. Some from personnel, then the law department, etcetera. The headquarters for government systems division, the headquarters for commercial electronics systems division, two operating systems in the government end, two operating systems in the commercial end, being broadcast communication systems, mobile communications. They were kind of all over the place. I was... I was in Camden for three years before I even got to the employee parking lot to give you some idea of the size of this. There were also, a lot of people might forget this, but the electronic data processing division was manufactured and the computers were built in Camden at that time. So it was a huge operation, and the HR department of course serviced all of them. So, that was a unique experience, and one just trying to figure out what was going on in terms of product etcetera, was a challenge in itself. But, it turned out, as far as I’m concerned, to be a unique opportunity. There was no formal training program. I would say in the HR department but the process they had could not have been better. Because you went through the each of the chairs that were required for anyone who was going to go anywhere in human resources. With time in it, they get measuring from people who really knew what they were talking about. So, it was great, a great and fortunate experience for me, I think. Okay, so, um, let’s talk about your supervisors when you started. Alright. I started, I was working for the manager of employment at the time, and it was large enough then with 18,000 employees that there were departments within. The employment activity that handled salaried employees, there was someone who handled technical employees. There was a whole engineering department, dedicated to recruiting, etcetera. So there was a supervisor of all employment, and my first three or four years doing recruiting etcetera I reported to one or two of those individuals. Very helpful. Again, no formal kind of training etcetera, but so much real life stuff that this is really how it works. It was much appreciated. [0:02:08] Speaker 2: [0:02:16] Bill Baney: [0:04:20] Speaker 2: [0:04:28] Bill Baney: [0:04:50] Speaker 2: [0:04:58] Bill Baney: [0:04:59] Speaker 2: [0:05:01] Bill Baney: And I moved from there, as you go through the seats as you will, from employment to what they called wage and salary. That’s now compensation today. Again, I had two supervisors there handling things like, uh, pricing or traveling, sending people to Japan out of the corporate offices, a great experience, which I had no idea how to do it at that time. But this was good, again, because we had I think about 8,000 hourly employees, about 4,000 engineers. So the compensation end of things was, was quite enlightening, etcetera. We also handled corporate incentive compensation. Really good, great experience. Moved through those chairs. I went from the wage and salary end of things into labor relations. Which when I studied in college that’s really the main thing I was interested in. And of course at that time there were seven bargaining units in Camden. So, all the labor relations you would ever want in a million years was there. Good tutoring, good advice, I really enjoyed the experience. I guess some of it was four or five years of that, and then I guess seven years I was moved in my first management role. And again, this is all no formal training etcetera, but just kind of the experience that is priceless, etcetera. So, I have my first management assignment as manager of that compensation department. Were you satisfied with your career progression? Did you feel like they recognized the value of your contribution? I’d say absolutely. I don’t think anyone... I don’t know where else you could have gone to get that kind of experience in that time frame. And I was compensated certainly fairly. I had no problem with that whatsoever, and I think the fact that they moved me from one assignment to the next was a pretty good indication that I was doing okay. And I thought... It could not have been more fair. Okay. In your position you dealt with a lot of RCA employees. Yes. Could you give us your general impression? Sure. I would think... Just this, the adage of the RCA family, we all talk about it, etcetera, it’s real as far as I’m concerned. I’m going to tell you firsthand. This was not something dreamed, and so this is the RCA family. All of the employees that I talked with and dealt with, and of course I’m interviewing new employees all the time, but there seemed to be an esprit de corps. A realization that there is things bigger than their individual assignment, etcetera. And I found that... I find this throughout. Kind of when I look back to it, it’s kind of almost hard to believe. I mean I... The bargaining units, etcetera, we all had our differences and arguments, etcetera. But, I think our bottom line was no matter what side of the table someone was on, there seemed to be an understanding that there’s one main cause. And if that  [0:06:17] Speaker 2: [0:06:22] Bill Baney: [0:06:46] Speaker 2: [0:06:49] Bill Baney: main cause doesn’t go, we’re all going to be in trouble. I think in general everyone seemed to be willing to work with one another, to help one another, and you know we went through some trying times, too. If you got out of that massive hiring, so whether the... We had some defense layoffs, etcetera, which were brutal. But, I think everybody acted like a professional, and I certainly was pleased. But that... It’s not just a word, “RCA Family”, it meant something and I lived it. Um, what were some of the downsides in RCA? Well, I’m going to get back to the sad part. The downside was because it was a defense citizen, we did have some major cutbacks, and that’s brutal. You never like to see people being let go or laid off, and I think from that perspective if I ever said what was the... Well... What was the worst part of it, no question that was it, just living through that. I can’t think. There might be some other incidentals, but that was the one thing that would stand out in my mind. Great. Could you talk about your co-workers? Yes. Co-workers, as I talked about how my supervisors may have helped me. And remember now, in these slots in HR, everybody is kind of in their own thing. There’s not two people really doing the same thing. But if someone has been there, I think the very first person who is... Who I replaced spent, I thought was a tremendous amount of time just getting me up to speed. And this... This was not unusual, because everyone was kind of moving through the seats at the same time. And always willing to help out, and say, “Hey, you don’t, if you got a problem, call.” Or whatever. So in the HR department, that... That team spirit if you will, was right on top. It could not have been more helpful. I really mean it. Did you spend time with co-workers outside of the working hours? Yes I did. We had a lot of time outside, and again it was a pretty big department. In those days there was probably a hundred of us in the HR department. We had... You know, we’d play softball together. We’d watch football games together. Parties at one another’s houses. Got to know a lot of them. Some no longer with us, unfortunately, but some became lifetime friends. And, yes, I would say I just carried this family idea on. And many of us, some were from the area. I was not from the area originally. So that... Being invited into that venue, if you will, was very helpful to my career. What about the influence of RCA on South Jersey itself? On the region? I’d say it would have to be huge. I may be a little prejudice, but not much. If you’re 17, 18 thousand people. If you look at Camden in 1960, Campbell’s soup was still pretty big in Camden right next to the RCA facility. But I don’t think they had more than maybe 3,000, which is a lot of people. New York [0:07:30] Speaker 2: [0:07:35] Bill Baney: [0:08:13] Speaker 2: [0:08:20] Bill Baney:  [0:09:51] Speaker 2: [0:10:00] Bill Bane: Ship down the road had probably over 20,000. So, the three huge companies had an immense impact on South Jersey. It really did. Almost anywhere you went, “Oh it’s RCA you work for.” The old timers used to say, “You worked for the RCA.” Uh, but it was RCA, and Campbell’s Soup, and New York Ship, but they went down pretty quickly. But the impact, almost everywhere that you went when you volunteered for things... And by the way, let me just say now, RCA as into helping out the United Way in an incredible way. The corporation matched whatever those 18,000 employees did, and then some. Almost the second year I was there, I was encouraged to help out with things like the chamber of commerce. I ended up later on for 25 years being the... On the New Jersey Business and Industry Association, the co-director of that. All RCA’s said, “Do it.” They want you to do this. This is in the community, and these are the kinds of things you ought to be doing. So that’s your... I think was there, and was supported right to the top of the house at RCA. Wow. What about over time, did you notice the development in South Jersey? Well I did. Uh, and I remember now, this... The time that I was there, I was in Camden for 15 years and then left for another 15 years to go to another RCA facility and GE facility, etcetera. But there was a lot of development. Unfortunately, the cutbacks didn’t help us. Because things were going downhill. RCA was, you know, on the cusp of the technical world. There was not much question about that. As far as what was going on in the community, now again we continue to support even though the numbers were going down we helped with United Way with volunteers and with money. I... I think the development wouldn’t have been much better if we did not have the cutbacks, but, you know, it was there. And they were always in the community, and they were always in the forefront of what was ever going on. How did your environment change over time? The work environment itself I think, uh, computers were a major change in the HR department. Maybe not as much as engineering has had there, but certainly it changed an enormous... How the work was done, and how it was processed, etcetera. The... I guess the other major change... We always had... We always had to have the tools and the people to get things done. Benefits became a major issue. When I was first hired that was nothing. I don’t mean nothing, but no one paid for benefits. It was just an expense that was incurred by the company, etcetera. It didn’t really need top notch professionals to run. It was kind of an administrative issue. Over the years, that became an enormous problem for everything. You better get your top notch people in the benefits. So from that perspective that really changed. Again, I think labor relations became a less of a significant event, but it did [0:10:45] Speaker 2: [0:10:49] Bill Bane:  [0:12:14] Speaker 2: [0:12:26] Bill Baney: [0:12:55] Speaker 2: [0:12:58] Bill Baney: [0:13:19] Speaker 2: [0:13:24] Bill Baney: [0:13:43] Speaker 2: [0:13:50] Bill Baney: before that because it was less people. Compensation became more complex. And we went through a lot of... We went through wage freezes. That will do something for your wage and salary department, and then it was catch up all the time in the hiring new graduates, etcetera. As inflation hit that, it was like, “Wow.” You jump sevenfold from one year to the next. So there were a lot of things then in the environment that made us change. We were right with it. People talk about family members working for RCA. I had heard several time, “My father worked there.” “My grandfather worked there.” Can you comment on that? Did you observe any of that? Absolutely. There was no question about it. There was... You know, I don’t want to call nepotism because that’s what we get in many, many of our great employees. But yes, there was no question. It was not uncommon to have, three, four, or five members of the same family working at RCA. And they could be in different fields, etcetera. I mean, engineer, you got somebody on the bench, but yes. I think an incredible number of people. And that’s a good sign. If you want your kids to work there, that’s terrific. Good, great place to work. What about husbands meeting wives? Uh, yeah, I did see. I did witness that. Not myself, but I witness a number of people, and this department that I worked in within three years were married. Secretaries or two professionals, or whatever. Not uncommon at all. And I guess our department would be very small compared to the others. So if it was big there, it had to be bigger in the larger departments. How did your children view your work at RCA? I think they recognized the fact that the old man was pretty dedicated, because sometimes they didn’t see him for a while. But there is no question in my mind that the three children that I have, know the kind of respect that I have for RCA and the companies that follow. No question about it. Now as you looked around your neighborhoods, did you observe other RCA employees in the same area? Sure, yeah. I was in a relatively new housing development, and I think the first two years I commuted with three other engineers. Three engineers and myself, and then they switched and went somewhere else. Which was not uncommon, moving within RCA. It wasn’t just Camden. I mean, you could move. You could move anywhere in the country. As I did later on. Not in the country, but yes, a lot of them from that. And that was a brand new community, so there were lots of that going on.  [0:14:18] Speaker 2: [0:14:27] Bill Baney: So if I asked you to just sum up, your career, your company, and all the rest about RCA, what would you say? Well, let me tell you where the career went. I told you I started in Camden, I was there for 15 years. I left as manager of then, combined labor relations and wage and salary it was called. I was given an opportunity at that time to go to either Meadowlands, Pennsylvania or East Windsor Heightstown, New Jersey as the HR director. I chose Heightstown. I liked the space business, so the career was I went from Camden to Astro in Heightstown. Where we were in the midst of having... They just finished a downsizing, so were hiring. We were building a Nimbus, and I forget the other... Oh, satellites. Very exciting business. And it was a different community all together. It was... There were no bargaining units there, but we were bringing in people very quickly. I got a chance to learn and go to see space shots etcetera that I would have never dreamed of going on. I think I was accepted by that management team very graciously, and I think I brought something to the table, and I think I learned an awful lot from there. Just quickly I was there. For four years, uh, five years. Moved from there, to take over the HR director at Moorestown, New Jersey. That was when Ad70 or what we now know as Aegis was all about. Bill Goodwin and company was one filing that next year’s. So this was a huge boom. I was there for two years. I went from there back to Cherry Hill, where the headquarters of the government systems division had moved. Where I was given a responsibility for... For compensation and organization and development, and employment for the whole government systems division. And then we’re about 12,000 employees. That would be Camden, Burlington, Massachusetts, Moorestown, New Jersey, and Astro. And we were given some commercial credits, because then we picked up Meadowlands and some of the broadcast plants. And I was there until ’86, when a merger occurred with GE. And from there I moved to take over the HR director’s spot at the whole Astro-space division that was East Windsor and Valley Forge. And putting those two together from an HR perspective may have taken two or three of hairs that used to be on my head up here. But that was a unique experience, two kind of different companies. Great companies, etcetera. I think there were... I sense more formality in GE then there was in RCA, but they were great companies. And you can look back and say, “Oh that screwed up my career.” It actually provided some more opportunities, if you think about it. Maybe there were fewer spots at the top, but there was certainly was a lot more very significant roles for HR people in the areas. And it opened up, you know, broader spaces. So, I moved from that role to take over all of the technology with Jim Feller. I guess it was Aerospace Technology. We had ATL in Camden. We had E-labs [0:16:26]  [0:18:14] [0:18:42] Speaker 2: [0:18:50] Bill Baney: up in Syracuse. I forget where... Oh there was... There was still some of the people in Valley Forge, but I moved my office from Valley Forge to Moorestown again. I was there for three or four years, and Martin Marietta came along and took GE. And then when you looked at the facility there, and decided, “Gee, maybe we can make the...” ATL was in Moorestown at the time. We said, “Maybe we can move into Camden and save some... Some rent.” If you will. And we did. We moved back, I think 1996. So I was in Camden for 15 years, left for 15 years, and came back, ironically. For more than 15 years. And then in 1990... ’90... When did L-3 come about? ’96? Okay, ’96. I was asked by then HR director, Mike Riley, to consider joining L- 3 after it spun off. So, I retired from Lockheed Martin. I think I moved my office three offices down the aisle, and then joined L-3. And spent, believe it or not, 15 years there and retired after 52 years with the whole enchilada. Great career as far as I was concerned. Now, along this time you encountered a man named John Mastran. Can you explain where you encountered him? Yeah, John Mastran was a corporate maven. And I believe his main thrust was in organization development. I met John, seems to be a lot of years ago, and I guess it was. You know, you would go to corporate staff then and say, “Oh this is this. This is that. This is the top of the heap, etcetera.” He and I were certainly not bosom buddies at all, but I knew who he was, and I think he probably who I was, because I was moving up the ranks okay. But it was great... In fact corporate staff was a very talented and professional group of people, and John was right on top of them. I was always impressed by the whole. The whole group at 30 Rock was what we used to call it anyway. And I had an opportunity to join that, and was not interested in going to sunny, downtown New York. So I passed up on that. Okay. Is there anything else that you would like to add to the interview? No. I guess I don’t want to get mushy, but you know, 52 years was a big chunk. I didn’t think I would ever live for 52. I’ll tell you a funny experience. When they first... I first was hired, they say, “Well, you have to retire at 65.” I said, “Well, that’s really not a problem. No one in my family has lived to be 65.” So, we went through that. I have to tell you that I don’t think you have to write to get the experiences that I had there. A lot of great people. Did I not get some of the things maybe I thought I did get? Yeah. That’s sure. Like all of us. But, there were not really any major disappointments that I didn’t handle. And, I... If we hadn’t had some cutbacks, I think I might still be there. The last couple of years with L-3, unfortunately we started to cut back, and that’s... If you’ve ever been in HR that’s no fun at all. Believe me. And, so I decided to try some volunteer stuff. But no, it was a challenge. It was a satisfying experience, and I don’t think I’d trade it in for anything.

RCAemployee;Art Simons;[0:00:00] Art Simons: [0:00:37] Male Speaker: [0:00:41] Art Simons: [0:01:17] Male Speaker: [0:01:25] Art Simons: [0:02:04] Male Speaker: [0:02:10] Art Simons: My name is Art Simons and I started in RCA Camden in 1966 immediately after graduating from the University of Pennsylvania. Uh, I worked in Camden for a few summers while I was going to graduate school and also at RCA Morristown and then I came back full time in 1971 to RCA Morristown. I worked there for a few years, came down to Camden on loan in 1975 and never left, retired in 2008. And when you started, what was your first job assignment? Uh, I worked, ah...I guess my first significant job assignment, ah, was AEGIS uh, it started... was called the MFAR in the early days probably pre...pre-proposal, uh, but I had some very interesting summertime assignments working on AEGIS and then, uh, after I came back and worked fulltime, I did some analytical work in support of AEGIS and a few other radar programs, I think one was called BATS and uh, then I went down into Camden and worked on secure communications. Um-huh. Uh, when you started work, did you have any mentors or senior engineers or anything? Actually, uh, that was one of the hallmarks of my entire 42-year career at RCA, is that there was also somebody who was willing to help, anxious to help, and more than capable of helping. Uh, so in the early days, uh, in Morristown, my mentors were Tom Bulger and Maurice TImken, and John Dodson, and of course Jimmy Sullivan and Frank Capaso was my boss during those summer jobs and he...he was fantastic as well. And then, I had...I was fortunate I had mentors throughout my entire career. Um-huh. Um, talk about some major projects that you did work on? Uh, well I guess some of the more significant ones were the, uh, KY- 57 and KY-58 secure communications gear. Uh, that was my... really my first assignment when I went...went to Camden. And then from there, I moved, uh, to Maroon Archer, which was a very large job in the intelligence community. In fact, that was a significant point of my career because, uh, we create a business area, uh, out of the Maroon Archer program and many of us from Morristown who were [0:03:53] Male Speaker: [0:03:53] Art Simons: [0:03:55] Male Speaker: [0:04:01] Art Simons: on loan to Camden ended up, uh, transferring to Camden fulltime because of that business and frankly, uh, it kept me in the business in...ah...in the engineering business for the rest of my career. I found it fascinating. Another major job that I worked on that I...ah...really enjoyed was the DINDI program which we did for the government of Israel and it was not only a fascinating job, uh, technically, but it was also an interesting job sociologically because condition of the contract was that we had to have, uh, Israeli engineers as part of our team and to see the interaction between the RCA engineers and the Israeli engineers was very, very interesting. We even had a Hebrew class and I always found it amusing that the, uh, 60-year-old sec...Irish secretaries were taking Hebrew lessons after work. Uh, and another, uh, program that I worked on that I, ah, really enjoyed, that was a great program with great engineers was NERVETRUNK, which I worked on, ah, in the 1990s in Camden. Um-huh. And of course there were many others. A lot of proposals. And you worked your way pretty much up the engineering ladder. How did that go? Well, ah, it was a hallmark of the engineering community back then that if you did well in engineering, they tended to promote you within the engineering community, but they were always on the lookout for management which was a two-sided coin because the best engineers don't always necessarily make the best managers and so for a long time I really resisted going into management because I really felt that I was, ah, technical and there were better technical people than me. But eventually I matured and I realized that I could manage well and I agreed to do it and then in 1979 I went into management, uh, first as a leader and then as a...ah, a department manager. Eventually I ended...ended up as the director of systems engineering. Ah, and throughout my entire career I was encouraged and supported by, ah, a host of people at RCA, which I thought was, ah, really one of the things I look back on as one of the most significant aspects of my career at RCA, is that there was always somebody there to help. Um-huh. Talk about your co-workers through your career? Well, I always thought it was kind of unusual and I...I really can't speak for other companies cause RCA is...and its descendants were the only companies that I ever worked for. But I...I always had the [0:05:09] Male Speaker: [0:05:13] Art Simons:  [0:06:08] Male Speaker: [0:06:13] Art Simons: [0:06:28] Male Speaker: [0:06:33] Art Simons: [0:07:03] Male Speaker: [0:07:06] Art Simons: feeling that RCA was very, very unique, uh, it was really more of a family than a job. I...I really enjoyed the people I worked with. I had a great deal of respect for their engineering ability and their intellect and, ah, they were always there to help you out and, uh, I think it's one of the major reasons why I enjoyed myself so much. It's...for me personally it's not only important to have challenging work, which there always was, and, interesting work, ah, and ah, a great work environment, but the people that we worked with were exceptional. And that was important to me and, ah, I appreciated that. It's interesting, the term RCA family has come up in almost every one of our interviews. I'm not, I'm not surprised. In fact, ah, I still get together with RCA people of various ages in three different lunch groups and a fourth group that's mostly RCA people. Uh, we...we were close when we worked together and were close in retirement. Um-huh. What about, ah, outside of work? Uh, outside of work, ah, of course family was the most important to me. I...have a wife and two wonderful children and now I have three grandchildren. Ah, I was always participating in various sports. I played a lot of softball, a lot of basketball, and, ah, played a little bit of bridge when I first started at RCA at lunch, ah, didn't really play a lot for years, but now that I'm retired, ah, I...I play serious bridge often. Go to tournaments and I really enjoy it. Do you recall any of the RCA parties? [Laughter] Some of them are hard to blot out. Ah, yes I do. I recall...recall them very well. We had great Christmas parties, ah, and we also had a lot of fun completion parties when jobs were over and we were really thrilled to deliver a system. We had some, ah, really wonderful completion parties with the customer that were a...were a lot of fun. But I think I enjoyed most of all was the...were the Christmas parties, ah, because you know I...I could bring my wife and she got to meet, ah, other people that I worked with and their spouses so, that...that was fun. Um-huh. What was the best thing about working for RCA? I think the best thing about it was that it kept me intellectually engaged. About a week before I retired, a young fellow stopped me in the hallway and said to me, well you're retiring and I said yes and [0:07:43] Male Speaker: [0:07:49] Art Simons:  [0:08:36] Male Speaker: [0:08:38] Art Simons: he said, well what about the work, what about the work? So I said to him...I said, well I have to tell you that the work was always very challenging. It was always very, very interesting. It was often patriotic and that was enough to sustain me for 42 years. Uh, I toyed with the idea of becoming a lawyer. Uh, before I went to, ah, graduate school in engineering and even in the early days when I worked at RCA when we, ah, unfortunately had a series of layoffs, I thought a lot about becoming a lawyer, but the work also kept me there and I have no regrets whatsoever. What was the worst thing about working for RCA? The layoffs. Yea, absolutely, the layoffs. I, ah, I started working at RCA in 1966 and I was going back and forth to...to graduate school and the...they were having a series of layoffs during that period of time in the late '60s. And I came back in August of '71 and they had the last layoff in, ah, December, right before Christmas of 1971 and it was...it was horrible. It really was and I think psychologically that's one of the reasons why I, ah, resisted becoming a manager, just the thought of having to lay somebody off was just, ah, really unthinkable to me. People have speculated that RCA changed South Jersey. Have you anything to say on that? Well, I think RCA was a...a significant part of South Jersey. Uh, my father-in-law, ah, well my in-laws got married in 1944 and they immediately moved from New York to South Jersey. My father-in- law worked for RCA for many, many years in material standards and you couldn't go anywhere in South Jersey and not run into somebody who either worked at RCA, whose spouse worked at RCA, whose uncle worked at RCA, everybody worked at RCA. There were a lot of people who worked in Camden and, ah, I think it...it is part and parcel of the fabric of South Jersey. If you're talking about South Jersey, you know, you have to consider the impact of RCA. You mentioned that the work was challenging. Did you feel that the work was valued by your supervisors? I always felt like...that they appreciated what I did. I...I really...I don't think I ever in 42 years, ever had a supervisor who didn't appreciate what I did and what...and what my co-workers did. And just to extend that a little bit, very often we would have visitors from the government, very high level people, ah, both in the military and in the government come and thank us for what we did and tell us that [0:09:22] Male Speaker: [0:09:29] Art Simons: [0:10:15] Male Speaker: [0:10:23] Art Simons:  [0:10:54] Male Speaker: [0:11:06] Art Simons: we were saving lives and, ah, you know, you can be a cool customer, but when someone tells you that it's really meaningful. Yea. Um, how do you think RCA was looked at in the customer community and in the rest of industry? I think with a great deal of respect. Uh, I don't think we were ever the cheapest, ah, in our proposals. We had a lot of competitors...I think who were capable of underbidding us. I'm not sure exactly the reasons for it. Maybe the high price talent like myself, I'm not sure, but we had...we won a lot of programs because the government knew that we delivered really fine systems that worked and if you mentioned the fact in government hallways that you worked for RCA, it definitely had an impact. So, I...I was always proud to work for RCA. So how would you sum up your career? Just a job, a good journey, how would you sum it up? Definitely not just a job. It was, ah, it was an important part of helping me raise my family successfully. We...we've had a wonderful life because of RCA. I enjoyed every minute I spent there. Ah, as I said, it was intellectually challenging and that was important to me and I meet a lot of people that I really, really care for. So, ah, I couldn't have been happier with my decision and we're thankful that RCA hired me in '66 and when I...for a summer job, and when I told them I was going to graduate school they said, we don't care, go to graduate school, you can come back every summer and, ah, that's when the magic started. Oh, um, so I'm seeing a lot of pride come out. Uh, pride in the work, ah, talk about also the effect of the work on our country? Well, as I mentioned earlier, uh, for, ah, 30 plus years, I worked in the intelligence community and obviously you can't go into a lot of detail about that, but, ah, I tended to be, ah, politically more liberal than most of my co-workers and people who were...who thought like I did, didn’t necessarily work for places like RCA. But I was not only, you know, liberal in my political thinking, but I was...I think a practical person and I...I certainly didn't believe in unilateral disarmament and I really believed that what we did in the intelligence community was... what a smart country interested in doing good both here and around the world should be doing and so, ah, I think that what we did had a major impact in the country. I felt [0:11:44] Male Speaker: [0:11:51] Art Simons: [0:12:34] Male Speaker: [0:12:50] Art Simons:  [END OF TRANSCRIPT] proud to be part of it and I still think that it's an important component of keeping us safe.
MarinCounty;Dr. Grace Dollar Dickson Kleiser;CE: Today is Tuesday, April the 3rd, 1979, and continuing the Oral History Program of the California Room, this is Carla Ehat. And once again we are at the residence of Mrs. Thomas Kent at 131 Goodhill Road in Kentfield. Today we are going to have the pleasure of talking with Dr. Grace Dollar Dickson Kleiser, and she is going to share with us today her reminiscences of her family. She is the granddaughter of Dr. Robert Dollar who was known as Captain Robert Dollar, founder of the Dollar Steamship Company and who is considered the Dean of American Shipping and a great philanthropist, a devout Presbyterian and – The San Francisco Theological Seminary in San Anselmo and also the Presbyterian Orphanage were two of the recipients of his many benevolence. There are more, I am certain, Dr. Kleiser. But when you mentioned the name Captain Robert Dollar today to people in Marin they immediately think of Falkirk, which is known as the Robert Dollar home, and it's situated on Mission Street in San Rafael. And today perhaps, Dr. Kleiser, you can tell us a little more about that. You were born there, I understand? GK: Yes I was. CE: On the property? GK: All the Dickson children were born in the old home in San Rafael. CE: And your birth date was? GK: March the 1st, 1915. I was the fourth?           CE: Child? Well let's see. We have your family tree sketch. Margaret Dollar was first, Frederick William Jr., second, Jane Elizabeth, third, Grace Dollar fourth. GK: Fourth, yes, I was the fourth child. CE: And you have two other brothers. GK: Yes. Robert and Melville, younger brothers. The occasion of my mother's death, sudden death, caused an abrupt change in my young life. I had been born in the house in San Rafael but lived in San Geronimo Valley in what is now a rest home, or rather a home now for schizophrenic children in the valley. CE: On the Dickson Ranch there? GK: Yes, the Dickson Ranch. That home, having been built by my mother to provide a large home for a large family which she wanted. And when I was a little child we lived out there with a chauffeur and his wife, who lived in an adjacent house, and a Swedish cook and a upstairs and downstairs girl, and two orphanage children that the family raised. The house had been built there in 1917 and we were living there. Suddenly, after my mother's death – CE: How old were you at the time? GK: I was five. I was five. Yes. The family was shocked and split up very badly, splintered, I would say, because of her sudden death. She died of a – apparently had an accident, was pregnant with her seventh child, had a sudden puerpal sepsis and was dead within a week. And it was a very shocking experience for our family and my Grandmother Dollar took us girls into the house in San Rafael. We didn't call it Falkirk, I never heard it called Falkirk. It was the Dollar House. And we were taken to live with her. My one oldest brother, Fred, was moved in with Mrs. Alma Newhall who was a very good friend, and the two younger children were left with a housekeeper at home. There being such an abrupt change – This was January 1920, and there being such an abrupt change, I remember considerable features. From that time on more than I remember before – I remember very little before. I remember my mother selling. I remember my mother taking us on picnics to Bolinas and down at Paper Mill Creek. I remember occasions with the family in San Rafael, such as Christmas and Easter and Thanksgiving. But after that time being transported there I remember more about the house and surroundings and that sort of thing. CE: Well backing up just a moment, your mother was the only daughter of Captain Robert Dollar and his Mrs. Dollar. Is that correct? GK: Yes, yes, she was the only daughter. CE: She was the only girl in the family. GK: Yes, she was the only girl. I remember my grandfather's reaction when, at the time he heard of her death. We were told that mother was sick and that's why we were moved into the big house. And I slid down the banister in the back stairs and came into the library and my grandfather was sitting with a ponchy handkerchief over his eyes and he had been crying. He had been weeping, and I realized then that something was different, terribly wrong and Mother was gone. And I remember the funeral. They took all the children, oddly enough, to the funeral. We all appeared. CE: Was that just the funeral at the church? GK: The funeral was in the old church, yes.  CE: Just a block away? GK: Yes, just down the hill. CE: Just down the hill. GK: And Dr. White had been a dear friend of my mother's. I remember the Christmas before she died, we had a Christmas party in San Geronimo Valley and he played Santa Claus. And after this episode I ran upstairs and peeked in the door and found Santa Claus taking off his boots and I knew it was nobody but Dr. White. But anyway, I remember there being a nurse hired for the children and then Miss Branson told me I was her youngest boarder, that I was five when I was boarding at Branson's. Now this is an odd thing because – CE: This was the school in San Rafael, the little white, gray school? GK: Yes the little school. I remember going to the little school down on what later on was Dr. Stanley's property. CE: Yes. GK: And I thought it was called Miss Stewart's School, but I'm not quite sure because I was a little child. I just remember the sandboxes and that sort of thing, playing in the winter. CE: We have some photographs of some of the children in that, people older than you, but like Eleanor Cushing Jenkins went to that school and showed a photograph of it and it was on Dr. Stanley's property. GK: I think it was. CE: And Miss Branson's School was a block farther down, wasn't it? GK: I don't think she is talking about that school. I think she's talking about the new school. And I think I was taken there when my grandparents traveled. CE: Well she moved to the new school in Ross in 1926, so it must have been the old school. GK: The old school. I don't remember this at all. CE: You don't remember? GK: No, I don't remember that. CE: Did you later go to Miss Branson's, a jump ahead? GK: Yes, yes, I went when I was a first grader I guess. I don't remember there being such a thing as a kindergarten then. But I went with Harry Johnson and Ned Griffith and Lloyd Brooks. Notice that I remember the boys? And these boys and Doris Newhall and Betty Schmidt and – I don't remember. CE: You know we wanted to interview Miss Branson but she's not up to par, as you know and we got Helen Hind Fortune. Did you know her, Helen Hind? And she told us the story as best as she could about the beginnings of the Katherine Branson School because she was in their first graduating class, the high school. Did you continue on with the Branson School? GK: No. The three girls were put in Branson's: Jane and Margaret and I. And Margaret was, let's see, she was 14 or 15. And we were in Branson's for three years at that time. But I remember, I thought I was down at the other buildings for some reason or other. When did she start that school? CE: I believe – School in about 1921, '02 or '03. GK: I think so, I think so, yes. CE Well what changed your schooling from – What happened then?  GK: Well, why did we stop living at my grandmother's and move back to San Geronimo? CE: Alright, before we move you back to San Geronimo, are you at that – Could you make a description of your grandmother and your grandfather? GK: Oh yes, very much, I think so. They were very religious people and – CE: I gather that and rather stern. GK: And fair. And at six in the morning we got up and I just usually – Well we'd run into grandmother's room and Jane would get one side and I'd get the other and we all raced for Grandmother because she was soft and warm and Grandfather was a little – CE: Was she an affectionate woman? GK: Yes. And we all ran in, the two of us ran in, My sister Margaret was in boarding school at the time, at Miss Branson's, and so just Jane and I were together and we'd trot in there and get into bed with them and, and then get up and have our bath and have our temperature taken because Miss Branson insisted that nobody came to school without having their temperature taken. And we had an early morning breakfast and grandfather would be driven down to the Union Depot, which was this main railroad station by – CE: Would there be a car at that time in 1920? GK: Oh, there was a car before I was born. In 1915 my mother ran over the Fire Chief in San Rafael and broke his leg. CE: Oh, that's interesting. GK: She had a car herself in 1915. And so – I have a letter she wrote when she was pregnant with me in 1915 and Mr. Schroeder was the Fire Chief and he had his leg broken. She wrote a very disturbed letter to grandmother who was in China at the time and grandmother saved that letter. CE: So you have that amongst your memorabilia. GK Yes. But anyway they had a car and – CE: He was driven to the station. GK: He was driven to the station. And we were driven to school at Katherine Branson's. Now that might have been the second grade. I'm not sure about my first grade. CE: And the chauffeur took care of this action? GK: The chauffeur took us down and – CE: Do you remember the name? GK: Dick Spellman. CE: Dick Spellman. GK: I do very well. He was a wonderful man. Then we were picked up at noon. I don't think school was longer than noon, and they picked us up and Grandmother always went for a drive, Indian Valley or Mrs. McNear's, or Belvedere. We had a sort of a – And sometimes out to San Geronimo to see the rest of the family, depending. Usually on Thursday we went out to, it seems to me, to Woodacre. It wasn't called Woodacre, we called it San Geronimo Valley at that point. CE: When we went out and interviewed your two brothers at the ranch there, I think they said that including the daughters and the new baby there were five generations of Dicksons had lived on that property.  GK: Yes. CE: And that is rather intriguing to us. GK: See, my grandfather Dickson came out and worked for Mr. Maillard. Well, he also worked in the gold mines up in China Camp up in the foothills and worked – CE: Chinese Camp. GK: Yes, Chinese Camp, that's where he worked and he eventually ended up I think not mining but working at the mill there. I think it was a flour mill, I'm not sure. CE: Some of this is coming back to me from your brothers reminiscences, too. GK: I'm not sure about that, but at any rate, he went back in 1869. This was in '52 or thereabouts, or '50 he was out first. He came out twice. The first time he came out across the Isthmus and then in '59, clear later, he went back to Vermont where he came from. CE: It's interesting, interrupting you just a moment, how many people came from Vermont that wound up in Marin County. GK: Well the Roys, Ralph Roy, was next door and he came from Vermont, too. CE: Some of those ranchos out farther. GK: Yes. And they all knew each other. They came from Ryegate, Ryegate, Vermont. CE: Why Ryegate? Ryegate had a bad summer one year? The crops didn't materialize? GK: I don't know but the Dickson scattered, they – CE: Well I have a friend who is a captain in the Navy, retired, and he left Vermont. He said he couldn't make a living there because things were so bad sometimes. I don't know. GK: But he went back in sixty nine and married Jean Barr, not the same Barr, not the same family. CE: Not the San Rafael Barrs. GK: No, Jane Riggs Barr, the name was. And they came out the first year the train was running, you see, and they came out in '69. And my father was born in September 1870 on the rancho in Geronimo Valley in 1870. CE: Are either of your brothers we met, Mel or Fred, like their father? GK: Like my dad physically? CE: Yes. GK: We all look alike, I think, somewhat. Not very closely, though. I think the Dollar strain carried through more because my father was short faced. Well I'm short faced. But – CE: What do you mean by short-faced? GK: Short features, not a long chin, a very short chin and firm, strong nose, shall we say, and they were all blue-eyed people and fair. CE: Tell me, did your Grandfather Dollar – Did he always have the beard? GK: The beard, yes. CE: Was that part of your recollection as a child? GK: Yes. He had very deep brown eyes and that carried through in some of my brothers and sisters. Very dark eyes and auburn haired, red hair. My grandfather was red haired. CE: Tell us about his physique. Was he of medium stature?  GK: Tall. Of course remember that I was little and everybody looked tall, but he was up to six feet. He wasn't six-foot-three or something like that but he was about six feet tall. When I remember him quite light, he was a walker. He liked to walk. CE: Well you were at least eighteen weren't you by the time he died? GK: Oh yes, yes, but he had shrunken down a bit by the time he died. CE: What did you learned from him that has stayed with you all of your life, would you say? Is there anything you learned from – Take your grandfather first and then grandmother. GK: Grandfather Dollar was, well, "Work, for the night is coming." I mean work meant everything to him. He couldn't understand why anyone would retire or why anyone would want a vacation. Work was his pleasure. He liked to work and worked very hard. CE: Was he a man of routine and habit? GK: Yes, very strongly. He got up at six, he went to bed at nine. He read before dinner and read after dinner. He always read after dinner. He came home from the office and put on his slippers and went through his papers before dinner and then in the evening he read, usually something from China. He was fascinated with the Far East. CE: Did your mother, as a product of that age – Did – Was she rather retiring as most women were? GK: Oh no, I don't think so. CE: I mean did she defer to your grandfather, your grandmother? GK: Oh everybody did to my grandfather. CE: Because of his manner? Because of who he was or was he a demanding gentleman? GK: Well he expected your behavior to be proper and good and for you to – CE: And he was the head of the household. GK: And he was definitely the head of the household, yes. But Grandmother had her phrase of "Well now, Father dear." You know, she was the peacemaker in the family and she said never, when you get married never let your husband know he can get along without you. She went everywhere with him, she never – He never traveled alone. And she always traveled with him. And she always took care of him, saw that his clothes were brushed and he was well dressed, you know, and so – CE: Sounds like they had a good relationship. GK: Well she had her position and he had his. And then as soon as she was on her own she did what she wanted to do. She liked women's groups and she liked lectures and she liked parties and she liked to see other women and she did this. And just because she had this handful of extra children I don't think it altered her life too much. I think she continued to do what she had done before. I mean, she include us in her drives and this sort of thing. She didn't stop going to see her friends because she had small children. But they were very honest and sincere, you know, people. CE: Did he predecease her? GK: Yes. CE: Did she survive?  GK: She not only survived but she didn't think that she would. Nobody thought that grandmother would live a year after grandfather died, and he died in 1932, May 5th, 1932, and she lived and traveled, I traveled with her afterwards. She went to the Orient three times after he died. And she enjoyed meeting people who came up to her on the ships and she – She was blind. Grandma was blind. CE: Towards the end you mean? GK: She's always been blind in one eye. Her brother had thrown a stick and put out one eye, the vision was gone in one eye. You didn't noticed it too much. But then she – One of the big things when I was little was going to see Dr. Sweet in San Francisco who was an eye doctor and they were going to do a cataract operation on her and then she came back home one day very disappointed because she couldn't have the cataract operation. Because she had only vision in one eye and they were afraid that if they did the cataract operation and it failed she would be completely and totally blind. She could see light and dark and get around, you know. I don't think people realized that she was as blind as she was. I didn't. When, in 1935, I traveled with her to the Orient and I went and got her deposited in her room after dinner and said I was going up to see the movie, she didn't want to see it. And I forgot to take a sweater and I went running back to the suite to get my sweater and opened the door quietly and I was horribly embarrassed to find that she was feeling the furniture to get an idea as to where it was located. And that was when I realized that she was blind and I didn't realized it before and I quietly closed the door and left. And she – When somebody came to see her she preferred seeing people in the suite and she could move around without anyone knowing she couldn't see, you see, in her own surroundings. CE: She had her pride. GK: She had her pride, yes. But she familiarized herself, you see. Oh, how long did she live after grandfather died? 1941 I think she died, didn't she? 1941 I believe. CE: Well there is a short article that said he died in 1932 and he was 88 and his wife died nine years later at 89. GK: Yes, she died in '41. CE: Tell me Dr. Kleiser, let's get back to you and get you sort of grown up here. You went to the Katherine Branson School and then what happened for three years? What happened then? You went out to the San Geronimo property? GK: Well my father remarried Katherine Rogers, who was the niece of the founder of the Academy, San Rafael Military Academy. And she was a teacher at the San Rafael High School. She taught math and science and biology, Miss Rogers. She was thirty and my father was fifty and she took on six children. CE: Well that was something. GK: And subsequently had two of her own born, in 1924 and 1928, my half-sisters. And I remember a conference in the living room at Woodacre, in the house, with my grandfather, my father and my grandmother. They had a conference and everybody was together and it was about getting – It was time to – Aunt Katherine, my stepmother, time to get the children back together again. It was just a business conference. CE: Well how long was this since 1920, this remarriage? GK: This was three-and-a-half years, in September of 1924. He remarried.  CE: Well where were the children scattered? You said one was at boarding school, and two were at the grandparents' home. GK: Yes. We were back and forth I guess because Fred didn't stay at Mrs. Newhall very long, I don't think, before he was back. Margaret was in boarding school and in the summers, I believe, probably, we were all together. I sort of suspect. CE: But you remember this. GK: I remember the conference and I remember the moving back home to Woodacre. CE: Well was that house built by your parents? GK: Yes, yes. CE: That now is a sanitarium. GK: And then in 1926, Grandfather took my sister Margaret around the world. CE: Now comes the opening of the door, some travel. She was the number one daughter. GK: Pauline Sharp. Do you remember the Sharps who taught music in San Rafael? CE: I certainly do. I interviewed them all in Carmel one day. GK: Yes, well, Pauline Sharp and Margaret and Grandmother and Grandfather went around the world that time and they went to Java. I didn't get a chance to go to Java. But they went to Java, I remember. Grandfather had been to Australia and didn't like it because of the labor problems, didn't like it from the point of view of establishing a business. But I remember when I stayed at the house in San Rafael, I remember people visiting Australia. So apparently they were considering extending the shipping line down to Australia and decided against it. And when she went in 1926, she – She also went up into India and I don't know whether they were considering more shipping into India or not. Anyway, it ended up that there was stopping the ships in India after that. CE: Alright, you're back on the San Geronimo Valley property. GK: I'm back there and I went to school with, under Miss Isobel Cook. She was my teacher, Isobel Cook. We had eight grades in one classroom. CE: Was the school there? GK: In Lagunitas. Lagunitas on the hill. And we had the hilliest schoolyard in the county. It was just like – It took a goat to run the bases. CE: You probably loved it didn't you? GK: I loved it. And we used to come down here to Kentfield for the May Day. Remember that Mrs. Kent? AK: I sure do. GK: And we used to come down on May Day and of course we were the tough, rough kids from San Geronimo Valley and we could run like goats. And we use to play half the day on May Day and play baseball over here at the Kent School, on the playground there. That was a big occasion for us, we enjoyed that a great deal. And we danced in the May Pole dances and things and Miss Cook saw to it that we behave properly. I think we were a little big exuberant at the time. The road in from that time, from San Geronimo Valley, was just two ruts, two ruts and in winter, you'd be up to your hub caps in mud. And it was in 1928 that road was built, I think. CE: Well the ranch today – My first impression everybody gets a ride. There are horses everywhere.  CE: It wasn't like that, we didn't have any horses to speak of. Weren't raised around that kind of a – We had – It was run as a dairy ranch. And my father never milked a cow, I mean, he hired Portuguese from the Azores and they ran the ranch. And I mean they were the workmen of the ranch. We didn't – I had a horse. I had my own horse but it was for pleasure. In the early twenties I remember my father running – He rented also water district property and ran beef cattle up there. And at that time we would have a big roundup and get the beef cattle off the water district. The nine hundred and fifty cares of the original ranch in Woodacre was a dairy ranch. CE: That figure seems to stick in my mind. GK: And we had approximately five riding horses and a team. CE: Where would you ride, way up in the water district property? GK: I always rode up in either the ranch itself or I worked in Nicasio. Mr. Farley lived over in Nicasio and they were friends and I use to go over to Nicasio. It wasn't paved then, and it was a nice ride, and I rode every day after school. CE: Why did they get the name Woodacre? Developers or – GK: I think Mr. Steve McKee's family and Maud Gardner probably. Steve McKee's family, the water district owned it, San Geronimo Water Company and he was Mr. Gardner's boss. End, Side A CE: Would you repeat that? GK: Yes, Mr. Ed Gardner ran the Water District. He was the large brother of my father's, and Mr. McKee was his boss. CE: There are still some Gardners out there aren't there, in Woodacre. GK: Betty is, Betty. CE: Betty Gardner. She's the Marin County Historical Society. GK: But she was from Cloverdale, she was from my husband's town. CE: Alright, so you were at Isobel Cook School until when? GK: Well she was the principal at the Lagunitas School and I graduated in 1928 and went to San Rafael High School and graduated in 1932 and went to College of Marin. CE: Who were some of your classmates at San Rafael that – GK: Oh, Rusty Ghilotti and there were two groups of people in school. CE: What do you mean? GK: Well there were the old-timers and the second generation of Italians and the old- timers kind of clung together in a way, somehow, looking askance at the Italian population because their mothers and fathers spoke with an accent, or didn't speak English, and so they were, you know – CE: Well, we interviewed a teacher who had taught there, Elinore Gihoagley. Is that her name, Mrs. Kent? Did you ever had her? She taught Latin. GK: No, I guess she was after – Oh, Miss Dufficy taught Latin when I was there. CE: Dufficy. GK: Yes, she was my Latin teacher CE: Were you a good student? GK: Oh, yes. CE: Were you interested in –  GK: Well, you see, we were inspired in a way by our stepmother and my father too. My father didn't go to college. CE: Tell us a little bit about your family. GK: My father didn't go to college and he was pretty much – I mean, he went to high school of course but he didn't go in Marin County. He went to high school in Oakland. Now I'm not sure there was a high school in 1890 in Marin County. I cannot understand my Scotch grandparents sending my father, in 18– Well, he would be sixteen, wouldn't he? 1876. I cannot understand them sending him to a couple of spinster ladies in Oakland and boarding this child to get an education if there was a local high school. AK: There probably wasn't. GK: And he would have been, what, well, it would have been even earlier than that. If he was born in 1870 and he was what, fifteen when he went to high school? Fifteen, 1885. He went to Oakland High School and became a close friend of Alexander Baldwin's. I mean Rollis Alexander. Rollis Alexander. And worked for a while for the early firm, Alexander Baldwin, and made many trips to the Hawaiian Islands and took his honeymoon to the Hawaiian Islands with my mother. I mean, his friends were connected with the – CE: How did your parents meet? Did you ever know? GK: Oh sure. Church. CE: Isn't that a wonderful institution. GK: Yes, church. The church in San Rafael. CE: Presbyterian. Describe – Are you like your mother? GK: I don't know. I don't know who I'm like. CE: Well you've just seen a photographs of her. GK: Oh, physically I am. Physically she was five feet eight. She was well set up, shall we say? CE: Sturdy. GK: She was pregnant every two years, she had children every two years. She wanted a big family and liked children. And she was pretty well set, pretty impressive figure. AK: I should remember, I met her too, you see. I should remember but I was brand new, just here. CE: Oh, Mrs. Kent knew her? AK: Well I new her as Elizabeth Arnold. I went out to San Geronimo, you were a tiny girl, and visited with your mother. GK: My grandfather Dickson was nice to my mother. He gave her separate property for that house and it was all fenced in and we didn't, weren't expected to spend much time at the ranch buildings, yes, unless you had business there. If you were going horseback riding, fine, but we were not suppose to go over and interfere with the work of the ranch, of course. And I don't think my mother ever went over there. I don't remember that she did. She lived, until she bought this house, on the old house on the property out there. That old New England cottage was built by, by my grandfather built a house for my grandmother and she said, “I won't live there." So, well, it was a small bunkhouse. And then my grandmother Dickson insisted on a proper house such as she'd been use to. She was a teacher and she  had lived in a nice home in Rochester, New York, and she didn't – She thought she was coming to San Francisco to live and she was moved out to that Godforsaken valley where there wasn't anything but, she said, some Indians, just a few Indians and Mrs. Roy and Mr. Roy who were a mile away, and her cousins who, my grandfather's cousins, who bought the next ranch. You see we owned both ranches in the family. Calvin. CE: Did your grandfather buy from Mr. Maillard? GK: Yes, the deed is in the family, yes. He paid quite a bit of money for that place, when you think about it. CE: Do you remember? GK: On the deed it says twenty thousand dollars. CE: For five hundred acres? GK: Yes. And he had – CE: That is a lot of money. GK: It seems a lot of money for those times, but it's written right in the deed, “For the sum of." CE: What year was that roughly? GK: The deed – I haven't looked at it recently. Oh, what year did he buy it? CE: Yes, roughly. GK: Well, I always thought that he bought the place in '53, but I'm not sure that it was that early. CE: We, in doing our research – The reason I mentioned this, Doctor, is that we found out that James Ross, who bought this Rancho Punta San Quentin, which is the whole rancho that runs from Punta San Quentin to Redhill and up through the Water District property, 1857, he spent fifty thousand dollars. But look what he got: 8,800 acres. But that seems to me an extraordinary amount of money. GK: It seems to me – I know the name was Adolph, Adolph Maillard. But I'm sure – Now I could be mistaken on the figure because it's been a long time since I've seen the deed. My sister Dorothy has the deed. CE: Would she amenable to have a Xerox copy of that go into the archives? GK: Oh sure, yes. CE: Or any photographs she might have that – GK: She wouldn't have photographs but she would be very – She has good memory. CE: Well, we did interview Ernest Maillard, who is 89, I presume, now, and got a great deal of the story of that property originally. GK: Oh, Joseph Maillard lived there when I was a little girl. I'd forgotten that. I remember him. Joseph Maillard lived there, he was – I had forgotten the name. He was a bird watcher. And I remember, he lived up there next to the Woodacre Lodge in a little small building off to the side. CE: Was the main house there, of course, then? GK: The main house was there, but not occupied for years, not occupied for many years. We played tennis on the courts, court, I should say. CE: All that's left of that property are those two little stone carons, aren't they? That sort of go into where the fire station is? GK: I don't know, I haven't been out.  CE: Had you – Children living there– Had you heard the story of the Maillards, the legends and the story of the family, etc.? GK: Some. My father always said he was married into the Bonapartes. CE: He was, yeah. And it's with great pride now they talk of it. Well, he was a natural heir of Joseph Bonaparte, who was of course Napoleon's brother. And Napoleon made him King of Spain. GK: Yes. CE: It's an interesting property when you think when you think at one time a grandson of our great patriot Paul Revere owned the same rancho prior to the Maillards, Joseph Warren Revere. Kind of interesting. GK: Yes. CE: And then the Maillards, that royalty influence and how land changes. GK I think my grandfather Dickson and his brother Calvin managed that property for some years before they bought it. CE: Similar to Whites' Hill. Wasn't White – Didn't we find out, Anne, that Whites was the superintendent of part of that property at one time and the hills got his name? AK: And it should be White, no “s" on it. CE: White. Well I put an apostrophe. GK: We always called it Whites' Hill. AK: That's right, but now they call it White Hill. GK: I know they do. AK: They're wrong, they're wrong. CE: All right, now all of the family, after the conference of your grandparents, the family are now together with your stepmother, Katherine Rogers, and the six children. Was that a difficult time for you initially? GK: Not for me. I was young enough. It was a difficult time for my oldest sister. She was jealous. CE: Margaret? GK: Margaret. And unhappy. CE: Couldn't understand. GK: Very fond of mother, missed her very much, never could adjust properly to the situation. CE: What is the difference in ages between you and Margaret? Two? GK: Four years. No, wait, seven years. CE: That's quite a bit. So she was – GK: She was a good, big girl by the time Mother died. CE: She had many more years with your mother. GK: Yes. But it wasn't so hard for us because Katherine was a very wise stepmother. CE: Did she survive your father? GK: Yes. Yes, just she died here a few years ago. My dad died in '54, he was 84. Wait. He died in '80. I'm trying to think of the year of his car because he had a new car. I've forgotten when he died. '56 maybe. CE: All right, now I want to find out how you became interested in medicine. Was this something – GK: Well I was a good student in biology. CE: You liked biology.  GK: I liked biology and my stepmother, remember, was a teacher of biology. Mr. Beebee was the teacher in San Rafael High School and was a very inspiring – Mr. Beebee, excuse me, was not the teacher in biology. CE: Was he a teacher there though? GK: He was a teacher, yes. CE: He evidently impressed you. GK: Miss Binsacca. Miss Binsacca is now, is still alive. I see her once in a while. CE: Really? GK: She was the teacher. I have to think of her name. She married Binsacca. Mr. Oliver Hartzell was the principal and he was a very – had a young, inspiring attitude toward high school and he developed a great deal of school spirit and everybody wanted to do well. We had a Miss Newcomer who was the math teacher and she was sure that everybody could do well, so she inspired everyone. And we liked the school, it was a great school at that time. And there were five hundred and fifty students, big school. CE: Five hundred and fifty students. GK: And I found myself doing well, you know, and encouraged to do well. CE: And what did you decide to do about it? GK: Oh, well, I was going to teach. I was going to teach until the time I graduated from college. And I had so much math and – CE: Where did you go to the university? GK: I graduated from the University of California. And then I was up at Lake Tahoe visiting my cousins at what is called Dollar Point now, which was just – We used to call it Tahoe City then. I mean, we were up at the Dollar place. CE: Did you have property there? GK: No, my cousins did, and they always invited me up for ten days, two weeks in the summer. And I fell off a new bicycle that my cousin had brought back from France and I ended up in the hospital and I was too late to go back to Cal. I couldn't get up on my feet on time, so I went to Stanford. And when I was down at Stanford I roomed with a girl who I had known in Manila, in one of our trips, Dorothy Harmond, and she was a Lab Technician at the Palo Alto Hospital at that time with her first job, a magnificent job. She made $130 a month, a terrific fortune, we thought. And I talked it over with her then because I said, you know, I don't like this teaching. I was practice teaching. CE: What were you going to teach, biology? GK: Well I wanted to teach science and instead of putting me in a science class of any sort, they put me in second year algebra and I had had no college mathematics except trig, and I had had it as a freshman. And I went to the Department of Education and I said, “I am only one step ahead of the students. I really don't think it's fair having me teaching a second year algebra class." So I dropped everything and finished what I wanted to do, which was medicine, pre-medical. CE: Where did you practice teaching? GK: Palo Alto High School. CE: Palo Alto High School? GK: Yes.  CE: I was wondering, then, if you had done it at the University High School in Oakland which was – GK: Oh I was there too. In my senior year we went there. CE: Well that's where my sister and I went to high school, at University High School. Great School. GK: Yes. Well they had us observing there, but – CE: Well, we're about the same age. GK: Oh, I'm older than you are, considerably. CE: Not by much. No. Three years. But that was a fine school. And my sister did her practice teaching in French there. GK: I think had I had a better supervisor of sorts I probably would have continued to teach. CE: Okay, so you make the decision, you're going – GK: There's another thing. I met a men that summer. I have to be honest. CE: Oh, here comes Dr. Kleiser. GK: I had met a man that summer on a trip to the Orient. He was coming back to be married. He was coming back to be married to some – not – I wasn't romantically interested in him. CE: Is this the man you married? GK: I can't think of his name now. He was a doctor and he had a lot of slides of his practice in China and I was interested in them and he said, “Do you know something? You would make a good doctor." And no one in our family had ever practiced medicine and it planted the seed in my mind. I had never even considered going into medicine. CE: Isn't that something? GK: But he saw in me something that he thought would make me a good doctor. And I now can't even think of his name. I knew him very casually and appreciated the slides he showed. CE: Was he a man who had practiced medicine in China? GK: He had practiced twenty years in medicine, in neurology, in China, in Shanghai. Parsons, Dr. Parsons. And he had graduated from McGill. And I said, "Oh I don't think I can get in to any medical school." And he said, "Well they take women in McGill." He knew why I didn't think I could get in, because I was a woman. And he said, “But I know they take women in McGill, so consider it." CE: Now what – Had you graduated from UC Berkeley at that time? GK: Yes. CE: You were in Stanford. GK: I was in Stanford CE: This is a trip in between? GK: Yes. I was a fifth-year student at Stanford. And I had this thought in my head, you see, and I was away from home enough to not be going home every weekend, so the influence of home was lessened. Of course, they always just knew I was going to be a teacher. Then, when I really though about it, I thought I would rather go into medicine. So I dropped all the education courses on the last day that you could drop them. I was carrying twenty two units, it was too much anyway. And then finished the physics and chemistry that I needed.  CE: Now you're still at Stanford? GK: Still at Stanford, yes. CE: And then? GK: Then I applied – I applied for medical school to two schools. CE: Which ones? GK: Stanford and Cal. To two schools, I must have been insane. CE: Only two, you mean? GK: I only applied to two schools. CE: Did they both accept you? GK: They both accepted me. And I was just amazed later when I found out that people usually applied to many medical schools. CE: Today, for example, a young boy I know, a neighbor, went to Cornell. He'd give anything to get in any medical school at all. His father's a doctor, he wants to be a doctor, can't get in. Good student. I don't understand it. GK: They're all A students. They are all A students now, going into medicine. It's just terrible. CE: Well then, I don't recall, what school did you decide on? GK: I graduated from Stanford. CE: You did go to medical school. GK: I graduated from Stanford, yes, all the way through from Stanford. CE: How long did that take? GK: Eight years. Well no, I graduated – It took four years, you know, and then a fifth year of internship and then my specialty training in pediatrics. CE: Is that your field, pediatrics? GK Yes. I was interested in children as soon as I found, as soon as I was in the ward. Dr. Harold Faber, who is ninety-something and still living and in Stanford Hospital right now, said to me, “You'd be a good pediatrician." I seem to be influenced by what people said to me. CE: Outside of the family. GK: Outside of the family. CE: Whose opinion you regarded. You must have had some regard for – GK: My father wouldn't talk to me for months. He was furious about my going off. He said, “You'll never get out of school. You just can't break yourself loose and get going." CE: Well when did you get your degree, then? Where are we talking about the beginning now to medical school at Stanford? GK: Oh I got out in '42. We got our M.D. after our year of internship. See, we interned from '41 to '42 and – CE: Now here would you intern, up in San Francisco, in – GK: I interned at Stanford under Dr. Bloomfield. Dr. Bloomfield, in medicine, in internal medicine. CE: Did you ever know Dr. Leo Stanley, by the way? GK: Oh, yes. You know my family didn't approve of him because – CE: I know why. I bet, because of monkey injections, or what? GK: Not because of that. CE: Why?  GK: Well, my sister rented an apartment from him and he was living with somebody without the benefit of marriage and my family were appalled at this, years before he was married, you know. CE: Well he talks about his schooling down at Stanford and he went to Cooper Medical. GK: Oh I know he did. I went with him to a reunion one time. I took him there. CE: He gets so hilarious about it. He says, “There's another fellow in my class and myself and he said the head of the medical school, loved to tell the story. One of the students, my two prize students, one wound up in Agnew and the other in San Quentin." See, one was the head of the medical unit at Agnew Insane Asylum and the other at the prison. Well, then you served your internship and you get your degree and have you any idea where you're going to practice? San Francisco? Marin? What did you do? GK: Oh I knew I was coming back to Marin County. CE: Coming to Marin. GK: Yes, naturally. CE: So you came to Marin. GK: I got awfully tired of school about this point, just before I finished my training. CE: All right, the war's on now. GK: Yes, they're cutting down the nine months internships. And I talked to Scottie Polland and said, “I'm sick and tired of the whole thing, I want to get going." He said, "Don't. Wait until you finish your specialty training," Scottie did. So then I went to Colorado and took residency in internal medicine there because I couldn't practice without a license in Colorado without taking the boards and they weren't going to be given for nine months. So I took a residency at Pueblo, at a hospital. Well this is getting aside from the point. CE: But you did as he suggested and finished? GK: Yes, I finished my specialty there. Then when I came back I went in with the San Rafael Medical Group as their pediatrician. CE: San Rafael Medical Group. And where are they, on – GK: Well there was Scotty, Mat Hazeltine, Scotty Polland and Arnold and I, and Howard Hammond, who was a year ahead of me in school. CE: We've had several interviews with dear Scotty Polland, and he shared his vast collection of Marin memorabilia. GK: Have you talked with Jean? CE: Yes. GK: She was an early – CE: Moore. We've got to tape her but we had – I thought it was so entertaining when he was talking about, “Boy, the doctors today." He said, "When I started we got out, we got three dollars when you made a house call." Of course, he's an older gentleman, of course, and two dollars when they came to the office. And it's charming how he tells the story of how he bought out this practice of somebody in the Albert Building for something like fifteen hundred dollars and they dickered with the rent, seventy five dollars they got this suite of rooms. Life was simpler then. GK: Yeah.  CE: GK: CE: GK: CE: CE: CE: GK: CE: GK: CE: GK: Have you had your practice – Are you still practicing? No. When did you give up your practice? Well, I stopped practicing full time when I had a late child arrive and I couldn't get help to take care of him. Then I worked in San Francisco for the Health Department for a while, with regular hours and no night work. Well you enjoyed your practice very much? Oh I worked for – I was pediatrician twenty years for the San Rafael Medical Group. Well I understand you're married to a doctor, as well. He's a dentist, yes. How did that come about? How'd you meet him? Meet him? He and my brother were building airplanes at the same time, gliders, as a matter of fact. The same pattern of glider, and my brother – Mel? No, my brother Fred and Jim Kleiser were building duplicate gliders. And my brother had built an airplane that flew out here over Stinson Beach. I don't know if he ever told you that. At any rate, my – They were building gliders and they had been friends for a number of years apparently, two or three anyway, and I didn't know Jim. I was going to Sally Foster's wedding party up in Hopland and Fred and I went to Hopland and he said he wanted to stop and see a man I know. Jim's father was very interesting. And so we stopped in and saw Mr. Kleiser and then went on up to Hopland to a big party they had, a great big party, it was a lovely party celebrating Sally Foster Atkins' engagement. And everybody I knew was there. We had a wonderful day and I met Jim Kleiser. We was playing kind of a volleyball of a thing and then he – What year was this? Oh, this was '37 I guess, 1937. And he was quite taken with me and he invited us back to his house for dinner. And I had nothing but shorts and my tan legs sticking out from my shorts. We got into the home in Cloverdale. We did stop, and it's a funny thing, if you sit at a formal dinner party with nothing but shorts on your legs, how embarrassed you are about your nakedness. But they were very nice people, and that was Saturday, and Sunday night he was down at our house. What year were you married, then? We were married two years later in 1939. I was married while I was in medical school. Was your husband supportive of your effort too? Oh, yes, he was very anxious for me to finish. I mean to complete my work. And he was working very hard. He'd have two patients a day, you know. I mean, he was trying to build up a practice, so lots of times his patients would be at night, anyway, when I was studying or at the hospital. So we lived a kind of a erratic life, but – When did you have children? My first one was born when I was 29 years old. What's his name? His name is James, James Dickson Kleiser. And goodness he's 34 years old now. CE: GK: CE: GK: CE: GK: CE: GK: CE : GK:  CE: And the other children? GK: The second one was Harry Armstrong, Armstrong being for Mrs. Keiser's maiden name. And then the last one was William Marshall, and that's also – Mrs. Kleiser was a Marshall. CE: From West Marin? GK: Well she lived in Santa Rosa with her Uncle James and Uncle Sam Marshall. But her father was Alex Marshall. CE: Well we did interview a Jim Marshall who was the – GK: Oh yes, a cousin of hers. CE: Older than you. GK: Yes. CE: A wonderful gentleman who had been a supervisor during the fifties. In fact it – GK: Yes, I know him very well. He owns a ranch near – See, we own – CE: Do you own the property next to Synanon, or near there? GK: Yes, yes. And we own the original Home Ranch, the Marshall's Home Ranch. CE: Oh, you do? GK: Well it's called the Canyon Ranch. CE: What do you raise on that, cattle? GK: Sheep. CE: Sheep? Do you go there often? GK: Yes. The sheep – You see, we bought the ranch. Jim and I bought the adjoining ranch to the original Canyon Ranch when it came up for sale after World War II. CE: I see. GK: We bought the ranch, we bought a house, and we were investigated by the IRS all in the same year, 1950. What a year. The poor IRS couldn't find much. We didn't have much. CE: You have three sons. You have James, Harry and William. Do you have any girls? GK: No. I almost had a girl, it was almost like a girl. CE: Almost like a girl? GK: I mean almost like a family. The Fred Dickson Family and our family joined after Jane Maggard was shot and that was Fred's first wife, and they had two children, and I had them with me for three and a half years. So they were little people with me for quite a while. CE: Are your sons in the area? GK Yes, yes. CE: Are they married? GK: No, not exactly. Well, my oldest son lives with a very attractive girl up in Novato and they're buying a house together. CE: What does he do? Is he following – GK: He works in Napa in switchboard, he works for a switchboard company, the Golden Gate Switchboard Company. CE: And Harry? GK: Harry is a teacher, a history teacher. CE: That's interesting. GK: And he teaches in Vallejo.  CE: And William? GK: William is a sophomore, excuse me, a junior at the University of California. CE: What is his major? GK: He's a mechanical engineer, coming up. CE: Wow. Dr. Kleiser, it's been a pleasure talking with you today. We're running out of time. I'm sorry. GK Well, thank you. CE: Now the experience hasn't been too difficult has it? GK: No. CE: But we'd like very much to have any entree to any memorabilia you might have in your family photographs or anything. Think about it and we can put it in the archives. Would you do that? Thank you.
MarinCounty;Fritz Barkan;CE: Today is Wednesday April 27, 1977. Continuing the Oral History Program of the California Room at the Marin County Library at Civic Center, this is Carla Ehat. And today we are going to have the privilege of talking with Mr. Fritz Barkan, and we are going to record this interview at the home of his daughter, Louise Salomon, at number 1 Cloudview Circle in Sausalito. I had the pleasure of meeting Mr. Barkan at a memorial service given for Doctor Leo Eloesser last year, and it was a beautiful string quartet. And I think at that time, if I remember, Mr. Barkan, you told me that you played the cello. FB: That's true. CE: You still do. Well, tell us a little bit about your life. Now, where were you born, sir? FB: I was born in San Francisco on Gough Street between California and Sacramento. CE: On Gough between California and Sacramento. Is that house still standing? FB: No, that was one of the many small twenty-five foot houses that were finally destroyed, and I think there is an apartment house there now. CE: What were your parent's names? What was your father's name? FB: My father's name was Adolph.           CE: Adolph. FB: Adolph. CE: Was he a physician? FB: He was an ophthamologist, although in those days they did not specialize in eye but were generally eye, ear, nose and throat men. CE: I see. Did he have his offices at his residence or did he have an office downtown? FB: Well, as far as I know, originally he had, when he first came to San Francisco from his native Hungary, he had a little office above or near a drugstore in the Italian quarter. CE: You are of Hungarian descent then? FB: Yes. CE: Do you remember what year he might have come to San Francisco? It was post-Gold Rush days, of course. FB: I don't remember. CE: Well, we can get that later. Now in addition to yourself, sir, you were born in what year? FB: 1884. CE: And the month and day. FB: February 27, 1884. CE: Are you the eldest in the family, sir? FB: No, my brother, Dr. Hans Barkan, who is a very close friend of Dr. Eloesser, was born in 1882. CE: 1882 and you had another brother I understand. FB: I had a younger brother who was Dr. Otto, also an eye doctor, and he was born in -- CE: Well, he is the youngest? FB: No, I had a sister. CE: Oh.  FB: It must have been -- CE: Well, that's on public record FB: Ah, yes '87. CE: '87 and then you had a sister, sir? FB: I have a sister. You want her name? She's still alive. CE: Yes, what is her name. FB: She's Mrs. Erich Offermann. She married a Swiss and has lived in -- all her life. CE: All her life. Well, tell me sir, I understand when I interviewed Dr. Eloesser in 1975 that the Barkan family lived each summer in Mill Valley. FB: Yes. CE: What brought your family over there? Just to have a summer home? FB: Just to have a summer home and there were a good many people, mostly a good many of them were German families that moved over there for that reason. Dr. Eloesser's parents was one of them. Their house is still there. CE: And then the Barkan's and the Eloesser's children then -- FB: We grew up together. CE: You grew up together. You know I found him a fascinating man, Dr. Eloesser. Oh, he gave me some starts in the interview. FB: Oh, you interviewed him? CE: I interviewed him. FB: This is not being recorded now is it? CE: Yes. I interviewed him, and it was one of the times, I think twice a year he came up to see, as he said, his baby sister Helen LaPlant, and she arranged the interview. And it was fascinating, and I thought I understood that it was a Barkan who encouraged him to go into medicine. FB: Yes, I remember -- CE: He loved the violin and the viola, but he had taken a trip to Mexico, wasn't that the story, and got an eye infection and then went to sea.  FB: I was amused over it. In a write up, I don't know if it was in Palo Alto or not, it spoke of his being an outstanding violin player. He was not, he was a viola player, and he didn't play too well. CE: Well, I remember his telling me that once a week, I think it was Wednesday night, he met with a little quartet in his home and the concert master of the symphony was one of the gentlemen. Could have been Naoum Blinder, I don't remember. But he loved music. FB: Oh yes. CE: And there is a beautiful portrait in his sister's home of Leo as a young boy. It's a portrait in oils playing the viola. FB: I don't remember it. CE: Well, did you know him fairly well, were you intimate friends or was it one of your brothers? FB: No, I knew him very well, but he was primarily a pal of my brothers although I lived with his family one year when my parents were abroad, and I think Leo at that time was a freshman at Berkeley, U.C. Of course I wasn't much younger than he was but I didn't know him nearly as intimately as my brother Hans, of course. CE: Well I guess it was your brother then who interceded and got him an opportunity to study at Heidelberg. FB: Well it must have been my father or my brother. No, no, it must have been my father. CE: Your father. FB: Because he had gotten his degree in medicine in Vienna and knew a famous eye doctor in Heidelberg, Germany very well, so that's probably how that came about. CE: Well it's interesting to me, your father was a doctor and your two brothers and that profession never interested you, Fritz, you didn't want to study medicine. FB: I didn't want to do anything. CE: What did you want to do, have a good time? FB: Mostly. CE: How in the world did you ever get into the diamond business? Would you like to tell us? FB: Yes, that was very simple. I didn't graduate with my class in High School. I went to the old Polytechnic High School before the fire when it was down on the corner of  Stockton and Bush. I was a very poor scholar, no student at all, and didn't graduate with my class. I was banished to San Jose by my irrational paternal sire who had some patients down there who had a private school. The old gentleman told me that he was going to incarcerate me down there, if they would take me, for the holidays and make up my studies with some of the resident teachers, which I did. CE: Was that a painful experience for you or did you weather it? FB: Rather. When I finally graduated and looked for something to do, the only person who would give me a job was a very old friend of my father's who also had a place in Mill Valley, and I think it's still there, who was a senior partner in a large wholesale jewelry business. He was the only one who would give me a job, so they started me there as errand boy at $4.00 a week, and I lived at home. CE: Do you remember the name of the company? FB: Yes, very well. California Jewelry Company. CE: Where were they located? FB: They were at that time at 134 Sutter Street. FB: That was in 1902. CE: And you started right in as an errand boy in the business? FB: I started as an errand boy at $4.00 a week and gradually -- CE: You say a jewelry company. They carried everything? FB: They carried everything. CE: Were they a forerunner of Shreve's? FB: Everything except clocks, I think. CE: But fine jewels, everything FB: They sold to retailers in the stores. CE: Was Shreve's in existence? FB: All sort of jewelry, chains, cufflinks, watches, clocks, diamonds, what have you. CE: Did you stay with them? Well, naturally you stayed with them.  FB: Well, I was really being groomed to finally be in the business, but it didn't work out that way, and I eventually started myself. CE: You started your own business? FB: A very small business with a little financial assistance from my Father and ended up having nothing but diamonds. CE: And what did you call your concern? FB: Just my name. CE: And you were listed as just jeweler or how did - FB: No I had it listed as Diamond Importer. CE: Diamond Importer. FB: In a very small way. CE: Now did you take this step before or after the earthquake and fire in 1906? Did you take this step before the earthquake or after? FB: Myself, no I put in three years in Amsterdam and Paris as a volunteer as they call it in a large diamond cutting concern. CE: So you were out of San Francisco when the earthquake occurred? FB: No, I left San Francisco in 1907. CE: Well where were you on that fateful morning in 1906? Were you still working for that company? FB: I was in San Francisco in bed. I had been to the opera, and I happened to be in San Francisco at my parents' home, which at that time was on Laguna Street facing Lafayette Square. And it was shaken up by the 1906 earthquake. The family were all over in Mill Valley already. CE: But you were there because you were working? FB: No, it was -- I stayed in town for the opera that night. CE: I see. FB: And I used my room in the attic. CE: Well then you were almost alone in the house.  FB: I was alone in the house. CE: What was your reaction? How old were you? Let's see, you would be -- FB: I was twenty-two. CE: What was your reaction as a young man? FB: My room was in the attic of --- CE: What happened, Fritz? FB: Well, I was shaken out of bed. My room was in the attic floor of this stone mansion. CE: All alone and your family away. FB: I jumped out of bed and ran to the window and looked out, hung on the window sill and looked out towards the west and saw the chimney, mostly the chimneys going down on various houses in the neighborhood where at that time Cooper Medical College was, a predecessor of Stanford Hospital and Lane Hospital. CE: I know about Cooper. Dr. Leo Stanley over here is a product of that. FB: Pardon? CE: Dr. Leo Stanley over here is a product of that school. FB: Oh yes, yes the dachshund man. CE: So, continue. FB: It didn't take long to make up my mind to get out. So I started down the back steps, it was a four story house, and I remember quite well the hard time I had getting out as I was being thrown from one side of the stairway to the other. I went out through the entrance hall, the quivering and shaking was still going on, and finally ended up down on the sidewalk in front of the house. It took me that -- CE: That amount of time to do it. FB: A minute and seventeen seconds to get out. And the next day or two I kept hiking downtown to see what was going on. CE: Well you didn't go down to the Jewelry Company that morning did you? FB: Yes, I went down. CE: What did you find, chaos?  FB: Chaos and Sutter Street, Powell and Hyde was debris. I managed to get up to the second floor, so I couldn't be of much help. CE: Well did your employer, was that all destroyed? FB: Merchandise was -- No the, one of them lived in Belvedere and managed to get over, and I don't remember how the old man got over there. CE: Were you advised by your employer Mr. Barkan to go find your family and relocate or was any guidance given to you at that time? FB: No I spent a good deal of that time trying to get - the girls wanted a ride out of San Francisco down to San Jose. CE: So you knew your family were safe in Mill Valley and your number one priority was to get -- FB: My father finally got over from Mill Valley, being a doctor he was permitted to get in to San Francisco. My bosses got ahold of a wagon and we loaded it with two trunks of jewelry into that -- they got some sort of a -- I don't now remember how the got it across the bay whether they got a launch or what and he brought his jewelry that they could salvage over to the home of Mr. Levison, who was a partner. CE: In Belvedere? FB: Lived in Belvedere. CE: Isn't that something? FB: And then it was over there for oh three or four weeks I think. CE: Inventorying? FB: No just guarding. CE: Guarding. FB: Living there with some of the family and my family, of course, was all over in Mill Valley already. Once in a while I would hike from Belvedere over to Mill Valley to see them. CE: Was your family home on Laguna facing Lafayette Square, was it devastated or did it just suffer that. FB: Very little. CE: Chimney's coming down.  FB: A few cornices were broken off, chimneys going down and very little interior damage. Some to the statuary and -- CE: But the fire didn't get to any. FB: No, we were ordered out because of the fire - you want all those details? CE: It's wonderful to hear it from somebody who went through it, sir. FB: My older brother Hans came up from Stanford, now how did he get up? I don't remember. My father had gotten over the second day from - no the first day - CE: From Mill Valley. FB: From Mill Valley. CE: By ferry I presume? FB: Got up to the house, and we two and he took the last walk through his house of which he was very fond and then he told us to go back up to the trunk room in the attic, fourth floor, get a trunk bring it down to their front bedroom. He wanted to save what things he knew my mother would probably like to have because we expected the fire -- CE: To continue and spread. FB: Yes. My brother and I swept that down a curved stairway about this wide, it was magnificent living hall which my mother hated incidentally and -- CE: And you got it downstairs. FB: Got it downstairs, dragged it down beautiful curved staircase, living hall, out through the vestibule, down the sidewalk. My father had taken his last walk around his home. CE: Where did you go? FB: My brother and I had brought the thing down, this trunk down, the beautiful carpets on this curved walnut staircase and heard the old gentleman's voice, oh, trouble, "Couldn't you have been more careful bringing that trunk down? Look what you did to that carpet on the steps." There'd been a nail on the bottom of the -- I'm just telling you, this is psychology. CE: Yea, you're going to lose it. FB: He was reconciled to taking his last walk through his home, he was on his way out and noticed that a nail had torn the carpet. My brother and I sat down and laughed, it was so funny.  CE: So incongruous. Well -- FB: And then we were told that the fire had been stopped at Van Ness Avenue and we -- CE: And take that trunk up those stairs. Did you have to take that trunk back up? FB: With the torn carpet. CE: Well, that's a charming story. Alright, then your family comes back after the summer from Mill Valley. FB: Yes. CE: And life resumes. And the next year, is it, Mr. Barkan when you decide that you are going to apprentice yourself and volunteer in Belgium in the diamond business? Is that when you go to Europe? FB: Yes. A friend of my father's, who was the main boss where I was working, suggested this. He thought it would be a good experience acquired, by that time, after the fire they gave up everything but diamonds, you see. CE: This company you worked with? FB: They got part of their insurance and didn't go back into the jewelry end of it. I thought that would be good experience for me and probably get me a volunteer job in some big diamond cutting company abroad. I would acquire more of a knowledge. At that time they were just beginning to cut these fancy shaped diamonds. Up to that time it was practically all round stones, and they were beginning to cut baguettes and marquises and heart shapes and all that sort of thing. CE: Well now we're talking about 50 - 70 years ago almost. Amsterdam? Where did you go? Hasn't Amsterdam been considered a -- FB: My younger brother was at school at Oxford, and he suggested, I not knowing any French, that it would be a good idea for me to go down to the country where with he and some other Oxford students had been going on their long vacations. You probably know that most British Universities -- But at the time they were mostly on their own. They didn't have to come to class or anything else. They had to pass the examination at the end of the term. So they spent their long holidays down in a place down in the country, along the lower Loire Valley, and he knew of this very noble but very impecunious French Count who took boarders. And he suggested if I thought I could stand that sort of living -- CE: To go down there. FB: To go down there. CE: Did you?  FB: I did, and I was down there for, oh something like six or seven months and got a start on French. Then I went to Paris, but I couldn't get this job I wanted, even as a volunteer. This concern had just had a young Canadian there for a year or so and they didn't want anybody else around. CE: So? FB: So what was there to do? Here I had come six thousand miles. So the man said, tell you what you can do, though. If you want to, you can go to Amsterdam to our cutting plant.Well I didn't care about that, but I thought well better than nothing. So I went up there and saw what they did up there, I couldn't do anything but watch what they were doing and put in a winter there. And when the next spring came along, the boss in Paris, there were five brothers in his concern, and they had the biggest finest cutting plant in the world. In fact they were the people who cut this famous Cullinan diamond for the British Crown. I was fortunate enough to see that cleaved. CE: What a thrill! FB: And all the work done on it. It's a long story which I'll tell you off the record sometime. And I stayed up there longer than necessary, but I had just gotten through this miserable Dutch winter and tulips were coming out and all that sort of thing I asked if I could stay longer and they said stay as long as you want, so I stayed half the year and then I went down to the Paris office and that's where I really got the education I wanted. CE: Mr. Barkan. after you left Amsterdam you returned to Paris, didn't you? FB: Yes. CE: Then what happened? FB: In Paris I worked I worked for the same people I worked in Amsterdam. They had their selling office in Paris and their grading office.The people in Amsterdam just did the cutting. They didn't do any grading or -- and they sent all that down to the Paris office and that was graded down there and sold from there. CE: Alright. Tell a lay person what you mean by grading of stones. FB: Assorting the various qualities. CE: The qualities, the size, the color, the cutting. FB: The color ,the size, everything connected with it, the shapes. CE: Now did you get involved in this then when you were in Paris,did you do some of the grading then? FB: Yes, that was all I did.  CE: I see. FB: I didn't do any selling. I didn't do -- I just graded the diamonds that had been sent down from where I had been and seen them cut were sent down to the grading and selling office and from there the salesmen went out on trips in Paris and all that sort of thing. CE: Would you care to comment, Mr. Barkan, on why Amsterdam has remain the cutting center of -- FB: Why it has? CE: The diamond industry. Now we're talking of 70 years ago, it still is considered that. Why? FB: Well I don't think -- I haven't kept track of it at all but Antwerp was also a big center, both cutting and, and, of course, I understand -- I haven't paid a bit of attention to it since that naturally Palestine, the Jews -- CE: Israel? FB: Refugees from these war-torn countries have established themselves in Tel Aviv and in various cities, they do a great deal now I think. But I am not at all posted because I have no interest in it anymore. CE: Alright. How long did you stay in Paris, a year or two? FB: Paris I stayed for a year. CE: A year and then did you come back to the states or did you tour? Did you take a trip or travel abroad? FB: No I didn't do, unfortunately didn't do any touring at all. CE: Did you visit your brother at Oxford? FB: Yes, in fact we went to the Olympic Games together in 1908. CE: And where were those Olympics? FB: In London. FB: After that I came back to -- I'd been over there as long as I had, I came back to San Francisco and went to work again for the same people with whom I had been. And they finally- oh the senior partner retired and they wanted me to buy in the business. Of course I only could have done it with my father's financial assistance, and he was quite right insisting that I not do it because of the setup, and I started in for myself in a very small way with a little assistance from my father.  CE: And did you have a shop? Where was your store? FB: I had no store I just had one room there in one of the buildings and stupidly left the family and traveled, most of the time. CE: In business? FB: Yes, importing diamonds myself and selling and going out and selling. CE: How would you import diamonds? Would you actually go abroad and, say, back again to Amsterdam or Paris or Antwerp. FB: Sometimes I would go, and sometimes I didn't and had a representative. There were brokers over there who were reliable and who'd do that for you for a small commission. CE: Yes. FB: The trip took so long. It took - the fastest I ever made it was nine days. It was long before airplane days you see. It was nine days from San Francisco to Liverpool. Three days over land, on the Overland Limited, and extra fare if you were lucky enough from New York to catch a fast Cunarder, five days to Liverpool. Nine days was the fastest. CE: Well, did the brokers ever come to New York with their diamonds and offer -- FB: The smugglers, oh,oh. FB: Forget about the smugglers. CE: But I was wondering if they ever did that, like merchandising is done today. They'll have a suite of rooms at the Waldorf Astoria and notices are sent out. FB: Not that I can remember, no. CE: They didn't do it in those days. FB: NO. There were any number of large manufacturing jewelers in New York who did their own importing and their own manufacturing of jewelry. CE: Yes. Your career in the diamond business is fascinating.We'll talk about that further some other time perhaps, but let's us go back to Doctor Eloesser and some of your reminiscences of that gentleman and Mill Valley. Did he -- Well, his family had a home in Mill Valley as well as your family is that correct? FB: Yes. CE: And his boy's growing up together. Did you share his love of sailing?  FB: His what? CE: His love of sailing, he loved to sail boats. FB: No, it was his brother primarily. CE: Well he had a sailboat, he had a sailboat called the "Flirt." FB: Did he have? CE: Yes. Do you want to share any anecdotes about Leo Eloesser? I understand that you went to visit him on his ranch in Mexico. FB: Yes. CE: Down at Tokumbara. Could you tell us about that experience. FB: That came about through Leo and his friend having been in Russia and stopping over to see my sister in Zurich on Leo's way back to Mexico. CE: I see. FB: And they suggested that she come with them and visit them in Mexico, which she did. Well, when I heard she was going to be there I invited myself - I wrote to Leo and asked him if he minded if I came down. And he said no, come and stay as long as you want. So I went down too. CE: What year might this be, roughly? FB: When was it? Ten years ago. CE: Ten years ago. FB: I don't think that long. Was it that long ago? CE: Well tell me Mr. Barkan, is it a working ranch? Was it a working ranch? FB: Not really. CE: Not really. FB: No. He had about 40 acres, I remember, some planted to fruit trees and vegetables and all the produce that they could use for themselves and he did most of the work. He had one man, a Mexican couple, who lived in the basement of the house, and he did most of the work himself, fantastic. CE: I understand when I talked to him --  FB: This little guy at his age, he was at that time -- CE: And he was teaching native women how to be midwives, I understand. FB: Oh that was the very end of his life. CE: Yes. FB: Not when I was there. CE: Not when you were there. FB: No. He was seeing patients. CE: He was. FB: He only was allowed to see, I don't know how many, and he had a little room in the basement of his house and they would come early in the morning - sometimes before his breakfast, sometimes after - and he'd see about seven or eight. And I don't think he charged anything at all if I remember right. But he was not supposed to interfere with the medicals in the little village down below. His place was up the most gosh awful road that you ever heard of. CE: Was he in the high country? FB: Yes. You could only get up there with an old war time jeep. It took about half an hour to get up there. Unbelievable ! And the little town was a place of about six or seven thousand natives but he was way up on the hillside. What he did himself was fantastic, physically. I remember him, down there and sawing, a metal type with a saw and all that sort of thing. You wouldn't think a little fellow like that -- He was strong in spite of being all doubled up in his old age. CE: I know. FB: In the evening in his place he would write letters. I remember him sitting there and he was always corresponding still with medical people in the east or somewhere. CE: Well you know his sister has a vast collection of his letters which she treasures and she plans to turn them over to Bancroft Library. FB: The actual hand-written -- CE: Oh yes. FB: Every,every evening. CE: Prolific writer.  FB: Yes. Joyce and my sister and I would be doing something else, and he'd be off by himself writing. And he worked around the place. He was busy all day doing physical labor. We went away for a few days. They wanted to show me some things, and he didn't want to come, he just stayed, he wasn't interested in that. But he had these people come and take care of them. I wonder if I told you about one, whether it would be of interest, to show his humanitarian interest, which existed down there. CE: What was that sir? FB: I know of one that I witnessed personally, it happened here. I don't know if that will be apropos. CE: Yes, sir, it certainly would. FB: We had a friend, a viola player, who lived down in Los Altos. I was away on a trip, I remember I went to Stockton. We knew him very well, I played quartet with him. Leo didn't know him. I came back, the trip was three or four days, the wife told me something terrible happened. What in the world was going to happen, what is it all about? And she told me that this man had gone down in the basement of their house in Los Altos, this viola player, and the furnace had exploded. He could hardly get out. He managed to get upstairs, but he was practically burned to a crisp. They took him to Palo Alto clinic and said to the wife who was Russian said, if you have anything in the world - he'd heard of Doctor Eloesser and they would give anything in the world if they could have Doctor Eloesser take care of this man. So I said, what about it? You said you could do anything, I said, well -- CE: I'll ask. FB: Go up and see Leo. And Leo had just taken care of a man by the name of -- He's still alive, viola player, Molanar. I don't know whether you remember him or not. He's over in -- He'd broken something or other, and Leo took care of him. So I went up. Leo was in his office. I went in. "Oh, Fritzy boy! How are you?" Here he was back of his desk. And I wasn't alright, but I didn't take. "I want to ask you something" "Well, shoot." So I said I hear you specialize in broken down viola players. He had just taken care of this man. He said, "What do you mean?" I told him, "I've got one for you." So I told him the story. I said these people are trying to live, and if they could only have Doctor Eloesser. He started to shake his head, and my blood pressure went down, and he said, "I can't take anybody away from there. " "Leo, away! That gang down there will kiss you if you take him off of his hands." This was Palo Alto Clinic, a Doctor Lee. CE: Did he agree? FB: He didn't say anything, takes down the telephone, and I hear him talking. "Hello, this is Doctor Eloesser, and I hear you have a patient name of so and so." I can tell you the name: Daniel Wall. "Can I talk to Doctor somebody? I would like to come down tomorrow morning with an ambulance and take Mr. So and So to San Francisco and take  care of him. "And the next thing I heard him say, "The ambulance will be down ." I've forgotten when they picked him up whether it was at -- CE: But he took him back to San Francisco. FB: "Send an ambulance down for him, take him back to San Francisco, and I'll take over." He sent the ambulance down. Oh, then it started with the man's wife. She said, "I don't want to leave my husband." I said, "Listen. You said you'd do anything under the sun if only you could have Dr. Eloesser take care of him. He's going to have him now." Leo sent an ambulance down, got this naturally all on his own. CE: Yes. FB: He has three or four donated beds at St. Luke's, happened to have one or managed it somehow. Took the man up there, operated on him, plastic surgery time and again and again over a period of eight months, and that was it. CE: And he saved that man. He saved that man. That shows the humanitarianism of it. AK: At his own expense. CE: At his own expense. Well, Mr. Barkan, I certainly want to thank you so much for letting us.. FB: I asked Louise if she thought I should tell you that. CE: Well, it's a wonderful story. FB: Because we lived through that, and we knew it. And I saw him the other day. Of course, the surgery was not perfect because this was before the big war when they learned so much about plastic surgery. CE: Well, Mr. Barkan, I want to thank you again for allowing us to come into your daughter's home this morning and record your reminiscences for us for the Oral History Program of the California Room at the Marin County Library at Civic Center.
MarinCounty;Martha Foster Abbot;CE: Today is Thursday, January 27, 1977. Continuing the Oral History program of the California Room at the Marin County Library at Civic Center, this is Carla Ehat, and today we have the privilege of being at the residence of Martha Foster Abbot, Mrs. Samuel Leonard Abbot, at number 501 Via Casitas in Greenbrae, California. And joining her today is her sister-in-law, Mrs. Paul Foster, also of Greenbrae. Martha Foster Abbot is one of nine children of Louisiana Scott Foster and Arthur William Foster. One of her brothers, Paul, married Margaret Calhoun, who is here with us today. The ladies have agreed to share with us some of their reminiscences of the Arthur W. Foster family and describe life at Fairhills, the estate of the Foster family in San Rafael. The life and achievements of Arthur William Foster have been recorded in many books, magazines and newspaper articles. Today we would like, however, to embellish these records with the personal recollections of two members of his family. Arthur William Foster lived 80 eventful years, 1850 through 1930, and during his lifetime he achieved many successes. To name a few, he was a successful businessman and broker, a philanthropist, a founder of the Bank of San Rafael which subsequently became the Crocker Bank. He was President of the San Francisco and North Pacific Railroad. He was a regent of the University of California for 27 years, and he was the originator of the idea to have a University of California campus at Davis. MA: He was one of the originators. He worked with Phoebe Apperson Hearst on that.           CE: Thank you, Martha. MC: He also worked with the Carnegie Institution. CE: And also, he was one of the founders of the Mount Tamalpais Military Academy, and an art collector. It is nice to be here with you this afternoon, Martha. Good afternoon. MA: It’s delightful to have you here. CE: Tell me, Martha, I understand that your father was born in Ireland in 1850. Do you know what brought him to the United States? MA: He was sent to New York first to correct a situation that had gone wrong. I do not know the details. But he came back knowing that he wanted to return and to live in this country. CE: He was in New York about 1870, and then when did he settle in California, Martha, about 1876? MA: Before that. They were married in 1876. It must have been around ’72, 1 or 2. CE: Now I understand that he was working for a broker in New York and came west and liked it so much that he stayed. But he brought with him a letter of introduction to a Dr. William Anderson Scott. Do you have a story on that, Martha? MA: Well, the thing that is interesting to me that in those days, if you went to a new place and you wished to know the people who were important, you allied yourself with the church. So his letter to Dr. Scott introduced him to his daughter, and they were married in 1876. CE: You remember about your maternal grandfather, Dr. Scott? MA: That he was a dynamic person and that he was with Mr. Muir on one of the trips into the Yosemite Valley. It was his writing of it, when he returned, his enthusiasm, that was one of the factors that led to the dedication of the valley. CE: Isn’t that an extraordinary story! MA: Yes, he was asked to name one of the falls. I think it was Vernal Falls. CE: Well now, your mother’s name was Louisiana and I presume she was born in that state. MA: Yes. No, she was born in New Orleans.  CE: New Orleans, Louisiana. Your father married her in 1876 and they had nine children. MA: They lived in San Francisco. CE: Initially they lived in San Francisco. Where did they live, do you recall? MA: Well Bush Street, and then later further up. I don’t remember. I can’t tell you this minute. CE: Bush Street. MA: But they started coming to San Rafael for the summers and then purchased what was the Mailliard Family, and I think moved over in 1885. CE: I see. Now that’s Adolph Mailliard who built the house that you now refer to as Fairhills. He purchased that land and built that home in the 1860s. And there was another owner in between. MA: Yes, Mailliard sold to Butterworth. Butterworth sold to Mr. Foster. CE: Would you name your brothers and sisters? I understand your parents had nine children. Is that correct, Martha? MA: Billy, Mary, Arthur, Anna, Rob, Lou, Paul, Martha, Ben. CE: Now, were all of you children born at Fairhills? MA: No. CE: No. You were though, Martha. MA: Yes, I was born there. CE: And when were you born? MA: In 1891. CE: What is the birth date? MA: April 8th. CE: April 8th. Would you at this moment describe your parents for us? Would you describe your father first? Your earliest recollection of him.  MA: Well, my childhood recollection of him was a person who demanded great respect. He did not play easily. Mother was the open door for us children, she played beautifully on the piano and was gay at heart. But always quiet, never took part in any of the women’s organizations of early days. Seems to me that she was home all the time. CE: Well, as the years rolled by and your father offered your estate for the Grape Festival, your mother didn’t partake in that either? MA: Oh well, she was in that, she was helping in that. The first meeting of what later became the Grape Festival. It was not known as Grape Festival now, it was an orphanage. CE: Yes, the Presbyterian orphanage. MA: Yes, the Presbyterian orphanage was in San Rafael at that time. I remember the building. And then they moved out to San Anselmo. As I say, the garden party given up on the hill, in the garden at Fairhills, was not a practical place. The road up was narrow. And it was after that the Kent’s so generously took over, and it became the very famous Grape Festival when it was on the Kent grounds. CE: Joining us today also is Mrs. Thomas Kent of Kent Woodlands. Anne, what is your earliest recollection of the time that the Grape Festival was held on the Kent property? AK: Well I wasn’t here. CE: I know you weren’t here. AK: But I hear about it. And just as Martha said, it moved down from the San Rafael, down to -- And I suppose it was in that time part of the Presbyterian Church. MA: It had been backed by the Presbyterian Church. It’s a history of Presbyterianism that very often they back things, and when once started they would withdraw and turn it over. CE: I see, dear, I see. It have a photograph here of your father. He was a handsome gentleman. MA: Very impressive. CE: Very impressive. A little awe-inspiring, a little foreboding. MA: And yet kind and generous. The tragedy of his life was that he wanted to give all the time. He wanted to provide and to give to everyone everywhere, and that impoverished him.  CE: I would like to quote from a book, if I may, and it’s from Jack Mason’s The Making of Marin. He describes in a short paragraph in 1906 about your father, and I quote: “San Rafael was refuge to hundreds of victims of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and fire. A shed 200 foot long was built in Foster Park, behind the Hotel Rafael, along with 200 tents that Arthur Foster put up. A regular Tent City the Marin Journal called it, with telephone, electric lights and sewer connections.” MA: I don’t remember that at all. CE: Well, you would be a youngster. MA: It was the Army that set up tents and took the Coleman Tract. It was known as the Coleman. Father bought that with the idea of giving it to San Rafael. CE: But he did it, he did it according to the books. Your father actually underwrote that and arranged it. MA: I didn’t know that. AK: On his property. CE: Yes, on his property. MA: Well, on the Coleman, yes. But was the Coleman Tract, did then belonged to him. It was not on the Fairhills property. CE: No, no. We know this is near Dominican, back of the Hotel Rafael. What was your mother like? You said-- Do you resemble your mother? MA: I don’t think so. CE: No. You said she was accomplished and quiet and was a homemaker. And the father was the dominant, forceful one. MA: Yes, he was very dominant. CE: Was he away a good deal? MA: No, he was back and forth. CE: Where were his headquarters, in San Francisco? MA: In San Francisco he had an office on Sansome Street. And all of his records were burned there at the time of the fire. Every record, every account of anything of his career in San Francisco was burned.  CE: You said earlier over luncheon that you and your daughter visited Ireland, and you were trying to trace some of the history. MA: Of the Nicholson family. CE: And you found out once again, records were destroyed. MA: Yes. Outside of Belfast when we tried to find the Foster records, they had been destroyed. And there is a very interesting man, a cousin Willie Cleary, who was captain of what resembled, of what would be compared to our National Guard, who met and knew all of these men at the time of the war. The landing field taken over by our Air Force adjoined the property where my grandmother was born. CE: Well, we have some photographs here, Martha, of the house on Fairhills, and it’s a beautiful home. What was the lifestyle there? Can you describe? You had a staff of help naturally, to maintain this beautiful home and grounds. MA: We had so much help that it seemed perfectly natural. There was never any strain. We had two butlers, two in the kitchen, two maids upstairs, aside from the gardeners, and laundryman. CE: Chinese help? MA: Oh yes, Chinese kitchen help, Japanese butler and helper. But there was a complete sense of accord and great courtesy. I was fond of all of them. CE: Was your household run on a fairly tight schedule, would you say? MA: No. I don’t know anything about it. CE: Did you get up early, or did you have to be -- MA: My father demanded that all his sons be at the breakfast table at seven in the morning. CE: How about the daughters? Just the sons. MA: No, he gave up. I never had any bringing up. And dinner was always started with a blessing. It was always formal. Not according to dress, particularly, except that we be neat and clean. And so there was that type of formality. That’s why I spoke in these notes of a solidity of home. I used that word. CE: Yes, we will get to that with our conclusion. Now, there are various references to the size of Fairhills. Some books say it was 180 acres, some say 135 Do you have an opinion?  MA: I thought it was 640. I thought it was a section. CE: All right, that’s good to know. Now, I have here a photograph, Martha, of some charming Hungarian ponies. Was this something your father became interested in? MA: Yes, he bought a band of Hungarian ponies. I don’t know where. They originally came from Russia. And they were a small type, more beautiful than the Shetlands, and with white mane and tails. Well, I’m glad you have that picture. CE: Yes, this is -- Margaret gave us that. MA: We were very proud of them and the band was kept for a number of years. And we brought into it a Manila type which gave a little more desired height. But the ponies were beautiful and high-spirited. CE: Did any of these ponies find their homes within the confines of Marin? Did you sell them to other families in Ross Valley, for example? MA: Oh yes. CE: Well, I have here also a photograph of the beautiful barn on your property. Did you have your own saddle horse? MA: Oh, later years. We lived on ponies as long as we could. CE: Live on ponies. All right. MA: This is a side view of the barn that was built. It was a hexagon. CE: Yes, and here is a carriage. MA: Yes, it was a Phaeton. CE: That was the Phaeton. Beautiful! MA: It took 15 minutes to drive to the railroad station, you see, they’d have to leave at least 15 to 20 minutes from Fairhills to get down to the station. CE: And your father would then take the train and go down to Sausalito and then take the ferry. MA: No, Tiburon. CE: Tiburon, excuse me.  MA: Narrow gauge was Sausalito. CE: Right, and he bought out the line that was the Donohue’s that ran to Tiburon. That’s correct. MA: I never knew he bought the railroad. CE: He was president of it, he controlled it. MC: He owned it. CE: I’d like to read into record, if I may, a little bit about that. There is a book entitled Redwood Railways by Gilbert Kneiss, published in 1956, and it says that: “In February, 1893, the Superior Court of Marin County ordered the 42,000 Donohue shares of the San Francisco North Pacific Railroad, which then ran from Tiburon to Ukiah, to be sold at auction in the administration of the state. Mr. A.W. Foster had been watching carefully for this announcement. And Mr. Foster, who had worked for a New York Brokerage House and first saw California when he was sent after an absconding fellow employee returning the offender to judgment, he had come back to stay. Now, in addition to his San Francisco Brokerage House, he owned three large Sonoma County ranches and with Sydney V. Smith... and Andrew Markham...he formed a syndicate and entered the successful bid. Except for Mr. Smith’s connection with the San Rafael and San Quentin Railroad, which was known as the Bobtail Railroad, none of the three had any previous railway experience. The court awarded the SFNPR to Foster, Smith and Markham on March 23, 1893” and Foster became the president. It says further, he was a quite demanding boss. “Economy became the slogan” and “there was grumbling but times were hard in the ‘90s.” And continuing further, “To Foster... belongs much of the credit for opening up the Russian River country as a vacation land.” Summer homes came to his mind. And the first sub-division was Mirabel Park, then followed with Camp Vacation. And you gave it another name, too. MC: Rio Campo. CE: Rio Campo, The Russian River Heights, Rio Nido, and Summer Home Park. MA: I don’t remember Mirabel Park or Rio Nido as being connected. CE: And this writer concludes with this little paragraph that I think is charming, he says: “Soon hundreds of city families boasted vacation homes” and “Guerneville converted itself from a hard-drinking, bull whacking lumber camp to a village of parasols, mandolins and ice-cream sodas.” MA: Do you know, I suppose that Miriam is too far gone, the McNears were connected with that development along the Russian River.  MC: And Rio Campo wasn’t a real estate thing, that was his home place. CE: Right. Well, let’s get back to you, Martha. Now, you’ve been raised on these ponies around the property and then it’s about time for you to go to school. Where did you go to school? MA: Miss Stewart’s Private School. CE: And where was that located? MA: A converted stable on 5th street. CE: Where the city hall is today? MA: Yes. CE: Who were some of your classmates? Do you recall some of their names? MA: Beatrice Howitt was one, Sarah Coffin, Marisha Mencher, Dolly Jenkins, Bernice Alexander, the two Boyles, oh we can’t go into all these angles. The Boyle family was an exceedingly interesting family, but I can’t get into that. CE: And you went to the Stewart school for how long? What grade did it go through? The 12th? MA: I don’t know that we had any regular grades. And later on my sister, all my sisters, went to Miss Morrison’s in San Francisco. But Miss Morrison had given up her school by the time it was my time, so I went to a boarding school in Santa Barbara. Blanchard Campbell, I was two years there. CE: Oh, wonderful. MA: It was up near the Mission. And that was before the streets were paved. We used to ride down to the ocean on Santa Barbara Avenue, on the dirt roads. CE: At luncheon Margaret mentioned that her earliest remembrance of Fairhills in San Rafael was that Fourth Street wasn’t paved. MC: Muddy in the winter. CE: Muddy in the winter. Now what year would we be talking about, Margaret? MC: About 1908. CE: 1908. So you came out after the earthquake.  MC: I finished school in New York, 1908. I came out to San Francisco and met the Fosters at once. CE: Well, let’s get back to your vacations. Now your father had these ranches. One was at Hopland and I don’t know where the others were. MA: He bought lumber outside of Willits. He invested in a Redwood Company. It was developed and it was a cause of his financial distress, at that time they lost money to it. CE: But would you spend most of your vacations on one of these ranches? MA: At Hopland. CE: At Hopland. MA: Yes, Hopland was our favorite place. CE: And what was at Hopland? Cattle and timber? MA: We had a pear orchard and access to the River and hill land. CE: All of you children go there every summer? MA: Yes, we all went there. CE: And bring some of your classmates? Live in tents? MA: Yes, there was a main house, but we slept in tents. MC: Did you take your ponies along with you, Martha? MA: Oh yes, the ponies were all -- I don’t know how they got them up there. CE: How did you get there? On the train? MA: Yes, I think they were put on the train in a boxcar. And we had complete charge. Up there we had complete charge of our pony. The care of the stall, everything about them. CE: The grooming of them and the taking care of the tack? MA: Oh, yes. We used to ride down to the river for swimming in the afternoon, the Russian River was a lovely place. Claire Nichols was one of the, no, Claire was one that associated with the Jewitt School. CE: Was her father the Bishop of San Francisco?  MA: Yes, Bishop Nichols. CE: The Episcopalian Bishop. MA: Claire is still living, but is very hazy in her mind. She is living over in San Francisco, at the Sequoia’s. She has faded out gracefully, quietly. She was a most vital, loving young person there could be. CE: Dolly Jenkins gave us a beautiful photograph of her and your sister, Louisiana, in a two-seater trap over in Bolinas. It’s a charming photograph, have you seen that? MA: Well, they’re in those pictures there. And Lou ran the Lodge at the Yosemite for awhile. She went up there and lived there at the Awahnee. She went to the Awahnee and then took charge of the lodge in Yosemite, and later on the tavern up in the big trees, the Wawona. She was an amazing person. CE: Did she ever marry? MA: Never, she had more beaus than you could count and wonderful men. They had a very happy young group, they used to have awfully good times together. I was sort of a hanger-on. I was four years younger than she was, and I trailed along. But they had a very large group, Marg knows that group too. MC: Oh yes, it was wonderful. MA: Very much part of it. MC: Dolly Class, Sarah Coffin. MA: Marisia. MC: Well, she came in later. MA: Yes. CE: Did you go over to Bolinas often? MA: Oh yes. We rode or drove. CE: Rode your horses? MA: Oh yes. In the early days there was a stagecoach, but I think we usually drove or rode our own. There were barns there that we could usually put them up in. Dipsea was a delightful place to go. There are lots of pictures of Dipsea here.  CE: Good, we’ll look at those. Dolly gave us one or two. There’s a charming photograph. I’ll get it. Is there anything else you’d like to share with us about Bolinas? Martha or Margaret. You’d go there on weekends instead of -- MA: Yes, we would go and stay often for a week or two weeks. And it was a very delightful place in those days. CE: Did you have a home there? MA: I didn’t have a home there, but we had houses that we could rent. The Almer Newhalls had that lovely place right down on the beach, at the end of the road as you go to the beach through Bolinas. The last place on the right was the Almer Newhall’s home. Almer was married to my cousin Anna Scott. CE: I see. Well, let’s get back to the other side of the mountain and let’s get the story of the seminary site. Now correct me if I’m wrong, but it seems to me that your father attended a land auction in San Anselmo in 1889 and purchased a 19-acre diary ranch which was known as Sunnyside, is that right? MA: Yes. CE: And about the same time the trustees of the seminary, then in San Francisco, were thinking of moving. Evidently your maternal grandfather needed more room. MA: And he died, I think about that time. CE: And your father then invited them to inspect his property, and they did. Is that correct so far? MA: I’m not sure, I’m not sure just when grandfather Scott died. Whether he died before the move to San Anselmo or not. CE: He did, he did die, according to the book. But in a book called Old Marin with Love, published in the bi-centennial year, there’s an article in there written by Clifford Drury and he says on September 16, 1889 the trustees of the seminary went over and saw the land. And your father then said, well, I will donate the land if the trustees would make improvements which would cost at least $25,000 within two years. And they accepted the gift of land and the considerations, and then your father then was made a member of the board in 1890. Is that pretty much as you recall it? MA: I thought it was in ’93, but I guess it was before that. CE: Now, there was some land that was bordering on Sir Francis Drake that was subsequently sold.  MA: Well, they had to sell off. The seminary was in a dreadful financial state, and to be able to maintain it and to develop it they sold off the flat land between what was then the railroad and the hill. CE: I see. MA: So you get all that tract that is now crowded with houses as far as Montgomery Chapel, was part of the original grant. And they went through many years of stringent financial need, many of the professors served without pay. CE: There is a painting of the seminary done by Farnsworth, who also did a painting of Fairhills. MA: Yes. CE: I wonder if that painting is at the seminary. MA: I don’t know where it is. MC: Downstairs in the Bensor house. CE: The seminary painting? MC: No, no, the home place. Farnsworth’s big one of the home place. There is a little painting of the seminary by Farnsworth that hangs in the office over there, down at the seminary. CE: I see. MC: It’s a small one, not a very big one. CE: Well, your grandfather, Dr. Scott, died four years before this all took place, did your grandmother survive him? MA: She came to San Rafael, and she died in San Rafael, not long after him. She lived with mother. I never saw her, she died before I was born. CE: Well the buildings, Scott Hall, Montgomery Hall, Montgomery Chapel, and the whole setting of it is beautiful. MA: Well, Mr. Montgomery’s money did most of that. He was a man that grandfather Scott persuaded to be interested in Presbyterian development. And he gave the money that built those buildings. That’s why one is Montgomery Hall up on top of the hill. CE: But your father was the one who had the foresight to give the land.  MA: To give the land. It is the most beautiful. I think in all Marin there’s nothing more beautiful. CE: Martha, we see it from our home. When you look, it’s like a castle on the Rhine. MA: Well, you look into every kind of country. It’s the most beautiful situation. CE: And we’ve interviewed a couple called Mr. & Mrs. Warren Landon, did you know that name? MA: Oh, yes, I know them, Dr. Landon. CE: She was telling us a little bit of the morning of the earthquake there, she was on the grounds and that was something. MA: Yes, the old tower of Scott Hall collapsed. CE: You mentioned at luncheon some names that I wish you’d repeat for me. You talked about McPhails’s. Was it a livery stable first? MA: Yes, we had a livery stable. CE: Is this in your notes? Then we’ll save that then. End, Side A CE: Martha, I have here this lovely photograph of your home in Fairhills, and you’re standing in front of it. Would you take us by the hand and walk us up those stairs, across that veranda and describe the house? What do you enter first, the vestibule? MA: You go into a hall that I suppose is 14 or 16 feet wide, that led down to a door that opened into the dining room. And on the left were, what were then called, the front and back parlors. They were over there. On the right-hand side was the billiard room and beyond that, my father’s study. CE: I see. And the staircase came directly down? MA: The staircase came about midway in the first hallway. CE: Was the house heavily carpeted? MA: Well rugs, not wall-to-wall carpet. CE: What was on the walls, do you remember?  MA: Yes, a red sort of damask. CE: Red damask. MA: I think the front parlor was blue, wasn’t it Margaret? MC: Yes. MA: The back parlor was red, there were connecting doors. We had 52 at our last Thanksgiving there, family. CE: All right, we’ll get to that. Back of the study, moving forward in the house, what was back of your father’s study? MA: Later on the billiard room was moved to there and the former billiard room had cupboards where my mother’s collections of Pomo baskets was housed. She had a marvelous collection of Pomo baskets which is now in the museum at Sacramento. CE: Sacramento. And what was back of that room? Where was the kitchen in relation to all of this? MA: The kitchen was back of the dining room, there was a pantry and a servant’s dining hall, dining room, and then the kitchen. And beyond that, a second dining room for the men from the stables and all. And that was where, for a while, the laundry was there too. Later on there was a separate laundry room. CE: Was the dining room back of the two parlors? Did I understand that? MA: It was at the end of the hall, the two parlors were at the left. MC: Right in the front door, you faced the dining room door, down at the end of the hall, with the big windows where the waterfalls come down when they ran the water. CE: All right, then we go upstairs, and up this huge staircase and there were -- MA: One, two, three, four, five, six, seven bedrooms there and in the annex were the maid’s quarters and bath. That was built out above where the kitchen was. CE: How did you get your water in those days, do you know? Did you have a well? MA: We had springs, I don’t know where it came from. Margaret, do you remember? We had plenty of water. CE: Do you remember your own personal bedroom and how you had it decorated, Martha?  MA: Oh yes, it had beautiful yellow roses on the wall and a large gilt mirror over the fireplace. Every room had its own fireplace, because there was no central heating plant, except in very early days a white-tiled column that was built in the end of the hall. This was taken out and the flu from that found charred wood. It’s a wonder the house hadn’t burned down. But after that a furnace was put in, you see. CE: But in the earlier days you had the fireplace. Was it one of the maid’s responsibilities to light a fire every night? MA: The men. The men brought up wood and we or the maids, or anybody, built the fire. I learned to build fires when I was a very little person. And we used to smoke corn cobs and puff the smoke up the chimneys. CE: You’re no different than anybody else. Was your bedroom on the front or on the side? MA: Yes, it was around this corner and towards the back. This one was my mother and father’s room, and then there was a dressing room, and then I had the next room beyond. CE: Well, what was on the second level? MA: That was the second level. This is where I was, at the time of the earthquake, up here. CE: Martha, this is such a beautiful home, large and spacious as it was, and Margaret, you certainly attended these functions. I can imagine that Christmas or Thanksgiving were festive occasions in Fairhills. MA: Yes, very much so. CE: Can you try to recapture one of those holidays for us? MA: Well, in early days, gift giving was on Christmas Eve. And on Christmas morning we always lined up outside mother and father’s bedroom door and went in, and there our stockings hung that were stuffed. And that’s where the opening of them took place. CE: In their fireplace? In their bedroom? MA: Yes, around their fireplace. It was always a time of great excitement and it was desirable that the presents that we gave were made. We had very little money to spend. CE: And you made gifts for your brothers and sisters and your parents and relatives? MA: Oh yes. CE: What would you make? Do you recall any of the things you made?  MA: No, I can’t. CE: Did you sew? MA: Oh yes. I always sewed. CE: When would you have the big family dinner, on Christmas Day? MA: Used to be on Christmas Eve, and then it was the exchanging of gifts after that, and then the Christmas morning. The tree was at the end of the front parlor. CE: Which was the blue room? All right. The blue room. Was it a huge tree? MA: Yes, it reached to the ceiling. CE: Was it lighted with -- How? How was it lighted? MA: I remember when the candles were lighted on it. CE: Now, how did they do that, Martha? MA: Well, they would set little candles, you just punched them down through the branch. CE: And it wouldn’t be lit too long, would it? MA: Well, I suppose not, no. We were very careful about it. There was a little disk at the bottom of the candle to catch the wax, and then you just pressed it into the bough. I only have one memory of that, it must have gone to electricity soon after that, because I can only remember one time, of the candles. CE: Did you say your main dinner was on Christmas Eve? MA: Yes. CE: Would there be other members of -- In addition to your family, would there be other guest invited? MA: Not outside guests, generally just family. CE: I see. MA: Isn’t that true? MC: There wasn’t much room for anybody else.  MA: No. MC: 52. CE: 52 members of the family? Well that’s right, with the brothers and sisters and their children. MA: I’m only saying that the last Thanksgiving we had at Fairhills, we had long tables that went down between the two parlors, and there were three or four roast turkeys brought on, carved at the table. MC: Tell them how you all took turns carving, Martha -- The girls -- CE: Yes, how would that be done? MA: I had a very clever Uncle Eb, I have his picture in here, I’ll have to show you later because it really is astonishing. He was an expert carver, and for some reason, we girls were trained to carve, not the boys. CE: Isn’t that interesting? MA: And at one stage in my life, we, and all of us could carve pretty well. Uncle Eb would never use more than one stroke to cut anything. When it came to the wing, it was a slice in this way next to the body, one there, and the wing came off. CE: Now, after the big meal, did the men retire with cigars and brandy as men often did in that era? MA: No, there was pretty much a shut down on alcohol. Very little alcohol was used. We didn’t serve wine at the table usually. CE: I see. And there wasn’t a separation of the men and the women? MA: No, anybody did anything they felt like. CE: Did the men go and play billiards in most cases? MA: Well maybe we did, too. CE: You did, too. MA: There was no separation. I don’t remember, do you Margaret? MC: No.  CE: Was there any music in the home other than your mother, whom you said played the piano? Did any of the children take any musical instruments? MA: No, she was the one, the center of it. I have a picture of her at the piano, in my bedroom. She could improvise. And She would take off different members of the family. She’d say, now here’s Martha and she’d play one way, and here’s Paul, and she’d play another. And so she was a very delightful person. CE: Tell me, Martha, what was Easter like? Did you have an Easter hunt? MA: We were very much tied up with the Presbyterian Church, wherever it was. CE: Wherever it was. MA: Well, in San Rafael, this would be, not in San Anselmo. CE: In San Rafael, yes. MA: San Anselmo was quite a drive, you know. And the railroad train, the narrow gauge, came into San Rafael at one time. It was extended to -- It used to -- its real course was up to Point Reyes, you see. But they did bring it in and it was disastrous if we were on the horses or ponies and had to pass a train on that road. My sister was thrown out of a surrey where her team climbed the bank when the train came along. I mean those things didn’t matter. They were just that. We picked up the pieces and went on. CE: Did you ride the train often when you were a young woman? MA: Well, if we went to the city of course we did. CE: Yes, but did you ever go out to West Marin on the train? MA: No. CE: No. You’d either go by your ponies or some other way. I understand from Margaret, didn’t you say earlier there was a train, private train, a private car, that went back east with Mr. Foster? MA: Yes. MC: Oh yes there was. CE: And when was this? MA: That was in 1904. St. Louis Exposition. CE: St. Louis Exposition?  MA: Yes, it was called The Louisiana Purchase Exposition. And we had a maid. CE: He took the children? you all went? MA: Yes, yes, and that’s the time we came home via Canada, and we drove in a surrey to see Lake Louise, and the hotel was a little white cottage. And then we went from there onto Banff, and that was a big place, very grand and formal. Goodness, we were astonished at that. CE: Can you remember that train ride? You were what, about 8? MA: 1904, no, I was about 13. CE: Do you remember the trip quite vividly? MA: I only remember just those incidents. I remember a little of the fair, not much. CE: But the train ride itself, crossing the continent? MA: No, it all happened and we had the awfully nice darkies that were porters and dining room service and all. We were never surprised at anything like that and it never occurred to us we were doing anything any different than anybody else. CE: Wonderful. Well you know Mrs. Kent and I have interviewed quite a few descendents of families that lived a gracious lifestyle in the 1870s and 80s and 90s. Ross Valley for one was a beautiful lifestyle for a few families, and they thought everybody lived like that. MA: I know. We didn’t know anything about the rest of the world or if someone did live differently we thought that was the way they chose to live. There was never a large system they were battling through, it never occurred to us. I hated church as a child. We went to Sunday school and church every week. The whole center pew of the Presbyterian Church was our family, you see, and I used to come home and cry, I hated it so. CE: Why? MA: I don’t know. I didn’t like the service. Dr. White was our minister, and he went to serve in the Second World War, and then we had one of the men from the Seminary come in and preach. We called him “Long and Dreary Day,” his was Dr. Day. He was one of the great scholars of the day. I hope this isn’t being recorded, is it? CE: No. Well, Margaret, tell us if you will, how you came into the family. You were from Georgia? MC: From Cleveland.  CE: Oh, excuse me, you were born in Georgia? MC: Born in Georgia. Yes, and a great joke amongst the family about -- Somebody said, “You’re southerners, but three of you were born in the south, two in New Jersey, and one in New York, and two in ?.” We were eight, you see. The first thing I heard about the Fosters -- My mother came home and said that she had met a lovely woman, very jealous of her because she had one more child than she did, and her name was Mrs. Foster and that she had nine children. So then, Mother and I were walking down Van Ness after the earthquake, when the stores were all little wooden stores with flags flying, and down Van Ness came two tall people, a lady and her daughter, Lou, who was completely sunburned from having been at Bolinas. And one was Mrs. Foster, the other was Lou. And Lou became my closest girlfriend in those days. Lou and Claire Mills, whom we lived next door to in San Francisco, were my two best friends. CE: Louisiana Foster, her sister. MC: Yes. She was older than Martha. My husband was in the middle, my husband was two years older than Martha, and two years younger than Lou. Well, anyway, Lou asked me over right away, over to Fairhills, and my mother said I never came home except to pack my suitcase. I was either going over to Mrs. Griffith’s, or to Mrs. Kittle’s, or to Miss Coppey’s or to Mrs. Foster’s, and the Cushing’s in Blithedale. So, I just thought that California was out of this world, it was such fun. And while my father-in-law was, well, he became my father-in-law afterwards, was austere, all of his young people were allowed to have friends. And even when they went to the ranch, each one was allowed a friend for a week and then they could have another friend for a week. CE: Well, what a wonderful thought. MC: Yes MA: Oh, it was a lovely life. CE: And then when did you marry Mr. Foster? MC: My husband was a sophomore when he proposed, and I’ll tell you where it was, it was out at the little golf course. Marin Golf Course. We went out opening night, we were spending, my sister and I, Martha, who was two years older than me, so Martha was in a great deal of this -- We had dinner at Mrs. Kittle’s and then we drove out from her house to this new little club that had just been built. And then of course, this was the center of many dances in the summer. CE: Yes. When you said Mrs. Kittle, interrupting you, which Mrs. Kittle are you talking about? MC: Mrs. John Kittle.  CE: John Kittle. MC: You see, Jack Kittle, her son, was in our group, Alan was older, so he didn’t go. CE: Did you visit them at Sunnyside? MC: Yes, that was one of the first places I went. And Mrs. Kittle herself, John Kittle. I have nothing but happy memories, everybody was so jolly. CE: I think you came to California in the right time. MC: We thought the middle west was so jolly, because after New York it was jolly, but San Francisco really was. CE: Well, let’s get back to the golf club. So you were there that night. MC: There that night and then many, many nights. We went out to the dances, and it was there that Paul proposed to me. CE: And what year was that? MC: And he was a sophomore. I guess it was ’09. ’09 I guess. We were married in 1911. CE: 1911. MC: We came back and lived on the street just next to the Fosters. So my children were, they were all part of this group. CE: Well, it sounds wonderful. Well Martha, you have written something that you very graciously read to us earlier. MA: You don’t have to use it. CE: I wish you would read it into the record. It is a beautiful, beautiful statement of your feelings. MA: One looks back on early days centered in Fairhills with gratefulness. We were given freedom and development of resource, mental and physical, and a sense of solidarity, home, a confidence, a sense of solidarity in home, and a confidence in guidance. San Rafael, a village, a precious cousin never used the word town. She gave us a delightful phrase when paving of Fourth Street was suggested: “Dear me, I’m afraid we’re going to have a boom.” Mud was often four inches deep, at corners long stones invited the hope of a dry crossing. I’m in no way competent to give a thorough picture of early San Rafael, our lives separate in so many ways. I remember Mr. McPhail, who had a livery stable on Fourth Street, a friendly and able person who would send a man for the  shoeing of horses and ponies, on the hill, in the barn on the hill in back of our home. Mrs. Hoover, precious to us, she would bring to us from her delightful candy store delicious ice-cream sodas to the trap, when we stopped there, with ponies restless to go. Thompson’s Dry Goods Store on the corner of C and Fourth, a place exciting and inviting, with mysterious garlands hung on strips above the counters. This was bought by Mr. Albert who gave so much to our community in later years. The Hotel Rafael, a beautiful building with wide verandas, graced with high-backed rocking chairs. I remember a gathering of riders on their beautiful mounts, mingling with a large group that had come to see them all. The hotel had a thick cypress maze and two paved tennis courts with shaded grandstands, tournaments were held there. And inside the impressive gates, the road led to the hotel proper, half-way up a grotto, always a mysterious and spooky place to us. The Coleman Tract, now Dominican Meadows, a Mecca. The army set up tents there to shelter the refugees from the San Francisco earthquake and fire of 1906. The Armory on Fourth Street was a meeting place for those who wished to help. Borrowed sewing machines, bolts of cloth, I remember sewing cotton flannel nightgowns. Mounted patrols from the Tamalpais Military Academy were added to the police force. They were equipped with loaded rifles and rode as far as Corte Madera, because, of course, beyond the range, there were those that wanted to pillage. One looks back on these days of childhood, because to us who are experiencing this challenge of these many years, there are so many memories. They inspire an absorbing interest in today and a search for new values. I have found it has taken many years to begin to understand the source of past efforts and to be sympathetic to the materialism of today. Always a quest for adventure. CE: Thank you. Martha, tell us, now I understand your mother was one of the women who started the San Rafael Improvement Club? MA: Yes. CE: Now, how did that come about? MA: Well, it was a need. Now Mrs. Babcock and Mrs. Menzies, I would think, and Mrs. Winteringham, were very strong in that. She was merely of that group, Mother did seldom work anything outside of her home. CE: Well the site for this Improvement Club was on your Fairhills property. MA: No, not on Fairhills. At the end of H Street. CE: I see. MA: Where Fifth comes along, and there was originally a tennis court there and a bowling alley. And that property was given and the building was bought from the Exposition in San Francisco, and brought over to be the club house.  CE: I understand that was the Victrola building at the Pan American, the Panama Pacific Exposition. MA: Yes. CE: Well, it has been a pleasure this afternoon to meet with you and your sister-in- law, Margaret Foster, and to learn a little bit directly from you two ladies what it was like at the turn-of-the-century at Fairhills.
MarinCounty;Sue Beittel;MG: This is Marilyn Geary. It's March 1, 2013 and we're here at the home of Sue Beittel at 675 Barbary Lane in Terra Linda, California and we're going to be talking today about Sue's community experiences in North San Rafael. First of all, I'd like to mention your – In 1997, Lynn Woolsey gave a tribute to you in the Congressional Record talking about your community service in education, transportation, land use, so many different areas and we're going to be covering those areas as much as we possibly can today in the time we have but before we do that I'd like to ask you about your early years, when you first came to Terra Linda. SB: Okay. I arrived in Marin County in about June of 1961. My husband, who was in the public health service, had been transferred from Lexington, Kentucky to San Francisco and we began looking for housing and found Marin County extremely appealing. And in the course of the summer we discovered Terra Linda. There were many things about Terra Linda that we liked very much. There were many young families here. There were lots of children. We heard very good things about the school, and schools in general, and we had a fellow, person from the public health service, who had come to live here so we got some good first hand information. MG: And where did you decide to move? SB: Well, we moved directly into this house that we're at now. We bought that in the course            Page 1 of 23 Interview with Sue Beittel March 1, 2013 of the summer so we – I have lived in this house ever since we arrived in Marin County. MG: And what was the neighborhood like back then? SB: There were twenty houses on this street. Each house had a minimum of one child, a maximum of seven. There were – Almost every house had a dog. Not every single one, but most of them. Most of the children were in elementary school. It was a very sociable place. That we had several social events in the course of a summer where the people got together, informally. It was very ease to make friends here. Of course with the children, they helped a lot and we discovered, we always enjoyed the out-of-doors, but we discovered the out-of-doors. We enjoyed walking around the edges of Terra Linda and into the community itself, rode bicycles, found places to go canoeing which we eventually bought a canoe. MG: Where did you go canoeing? SB: Oh in the – It started in the lagoon at the Civic Center, where we taught the kids to paddle the canoe and then China Camp, used to put the canoe in at Richardson Bay and numerous places in the county. Can't even think of them all now, there were a number of creeks. I actually was a founding member of the Marin Canoe Club, which grew from that interest that my husband and I both had. We had both been councilors at summer camp. MG: So the neighborhood, other parts of Terra Linda, what were they like when you first came? SB: Well, there weren't a great deal of difference between Terra Linda, Marinwood and Lucas Valley, except for the fact that some of the houses were built at a later date and some in, not very many before this group that I lived in so that there were a lot of young families, mostly single family houses, detached, and people were a mixed group, more in Terra Linda and in Eichler houses then other places because he seemed to have an interest in selling houses to African-American families. There were a number of professional African-Americans living here. There was a small group of people who had come from Chinatown who lived in one area of Terra Linda, there was this group of people from Japantown. MG: Where was the area where the Chinese people lived? SB: They were up in the area, on the other side of Santa Margarita School. Let see, what, I don't, I can't think of whether it's northeast but I – MG: On the other side of Santa Margarita School. SB: I had a young girl who I still kept in touch with, who had a Japanese father, and a, no, a Japanese mother and a Chinese father. She actually just ran for office in Washington and we've been in touch about that. So was in my Girl Scout troop. MG: So there was some diversity.   Page 2 of 23  Interview with Sue Beittel March 1, 2013 SB: There was some, the beginning. Yeah. I think we were one of the beginning of the diverse community for Marin County and it was welcomed here. MG: And I understand that Catherine Munson lived across the street from you. SB: She lived across the street from me and she had three young girls in her family. They were friends of my kids and were, welcomed us when we first came here actually during the first week or so. MG: Was Catherine in the sales of selling Eichler homes at that point? SB: She was in the sale of selling Eichler homes and her husband, who died at a young age, was one of a family of people who had moved to Marin County, the Munson family. There were three Munson families from of that group who came here. One was a teacher and one worked at the TV station. MG: Here in Terra Linda? SB: No, he was a teacher at Miller Creek School when I got to know him, Jim Munson. His wife was the favored piano teacher of the area. Many people took piano lessons from Shirley Munson. MG: So at a certain point you got involved with Dixie School District. SB: I did. MG: Can you talk about that? SB: Yes. I went to a meeting when my son was about to enroll in first grade the first year we were here and was told there was one place left on the board of the Parent-Teacher organization and it was as a legislative chairman and I thought, "I don't know anything about this but I'd really like to be on that board." so I became involved at that point and learned as much as I could, which wasn't too much, but I have since learned a lot about legislation and education legislation and actually been to Sacramento many times since that time. Too bad that I didn't know that much and could have been more useful at that time. MG: What kind of issues were you needing to be involved with legislatively, at that point? SB: Always money. That the schools were funded by the local property tax. The Dixie District was a so-called low-wealth school district and so we were always having to ask for more money from the property tax to fund the schools. This was before the famous Serrano-Priest Decision where they, the state, took over the decision about how much a school should be funded so the Dixie Schools, however, were able to build ten schools in a fairly short period of time but it required state money which was a big advantage over the San Rafael Schools because the state   Page 3 of 23  Interview with Sue Beittel March 1, 2013 required that you have at least a ten acre site to build a school where as in San Rafael they paid for the schools as they went along and they built schools on a much smaller site. I know a bit about that because I served later on the San Rafael School Board. MG: So Dixie School has a really very good reputation. Can you talk a little about how it got that reputation? How it's quality became so well, so good? SB: Yes. Well, it certainly had a good reputation because it had good leadership. Interestingly, the long time superintendent had come from a rural area in Northern California and had a rather folksy way about him. When he was going to determined how many new students to expect, he'd go riding around the community and look at how many new houses there were and then figure out how many students he normally got from a house. But he was very good at hiring other people, and he hired Dr. Penrod Moss, who was a very innovated educator, and really set the tone for the educational programs of the school district, much of it by demonstrating how to do it, himself, and then another member of the community did the administrative and financial part of it and that was Joe Gulf who lived over on the other side of, in an Eichler house on the other side of the community. There were two psychologists in the school district, speech therapists, a nurse. It was very well, many covered with not only educational folks but people who provided other supplemental things. MG: And who was the – Excuse me. What was the name of the supervisor that you said, or the superintendent who hired – SB: Denny Willis, his name was. And he was a very interesting person, who was very well respected by all of the board members and the community. He was, he did an amazing job. MG: I understand that you started an outdoor education program. Is that true? SB: I was, I served on a board called the Dixie Institute for Educational Research which acquired a small amount of money to give to people who wanted to do innovative educational programs and so, even though I was on the board, I was part of a group of three people, one of them was Jean Starkweather and Wilma Follett and I applied for a grant and we did this program over the course of a number years in fifth and sixth grade at the Santa Margarita School where our students had gone to school. Actually they were, had pretty well left by the time we got fully going but we did educational programs in the school: plant identification, bird identification. We did outdoor activities in this community, taking the students out and then ended up the program by going to Audubon Canyon Ranch before there was a docent program at Audubon Canyon Ranch. So – MG: Sounds like a wonderful program. SB: It was a very good program. I should mention that the Dixie School District was one of the first school districts to use volunteers in the classroom and they had a very organized way of introducing volunteers. They had the school psychologist, who ran a several week course before you became a volunteer and so you knew many things that were useful as you were volunteering   Page 4 of 23  Interview with Sue Beittel March 1, 2013 your time. I did volunteer in a number of classrooms and got to know some teachers quite well. MG: What other kinds of things would you do? SB: Mostly doing a lot of one-to-one work when we, with students, some spelling and other things that they needed help on, or they were advanced students who needed to go forward faster. So the Dixie District had many young teachers because it was growing rapidly. It went from the one school at Bernard Hoffman to ten schools and each spring they would advertise for teachers and they would have many more applicants than they had a place for so they were able to pick and choose and get some very fine teachers.  MG: SB: MG: SB: MG: So they had a very high quality staff of – Very high quality staff of young teachers. Young teachers. And you were, also you mentioned on the San Rafael School Board. I was. How did that happen? SB: the end of his time on the school board, we were on a hike on New Year's Day, and would I consider running for his spot. There hadn't been very many women either on the Dixie School Board or on the San Rafael School Board, a scattering over time but not very many. It was mostly a men's place and so there were eight people that were going for two spots and I was lucky enough to get one of them. Even though I lived in the Dixie School District, and the San Rafael District is a common administration district, it has one board that administers both the San Rafael Elementary and the San Rafael High School District. My kids, of course, never went to the elementary district but all were at Terra Linda High School, part of the San Rafael High School District. MG: So when you won the spot on the board, what kind of campaigning did you have to do to obtain – SB: Lots of – MG: That? SB: I had long experience with going door-to-door campaigning for both for myself and for others. Having discovered though, when I got over the age of eighty, that people didn't, weren't that enthusiastic about hearing my opinion at the front door. MG: You have really done a lot over the years. You hit the pavement. Well, my friend and former classmate at college, Larry Crammer, said he was coming to  Page 5 of 23  Interview with Sue Beittel March 1, 2013  SB: Yes, I hit the pavement. MG: And what kind of goals did you have when you started working on the San Rafael Board of Education? SB: Well, I'm very interested in some hands-on kind of education. My background is in chemistry. I was interested in science and vocational education has also been one of my big interests and so I had these interests, although I'm certainly interested is a very strong academic program. And had a very interesting time. I served two terms on the San Rafael School Board. MG: Is the vocational program that the schools, that they have, I think it's called ROP, Regional Occupational Program? Is that something that you were involved in? SB: I wasn't involved in it but I certainly support it, and I had always dreamed that there would be more vocational programs at the local high school, comprehensive high school, but we got into lots more academics than vocational issues so we only touched lightly on that. I did end up chairing a statewide commission on vocational education and had a chance to look at vocational programs throughout the state. MG: How does Marin compare to other areas with, in terms of our vocational education? SB: Not well. That, in other areas, they are much more interested in preparing people for jobs. In Marin we seem to be much more interested in preparing people for colleges and universities. MG: What do you think about having separate school districts? There are so many separate school districts in Marin. And some people think that it's inefficient. What's your thoughts on that? SB: Well, I have served for a number of years on the county committee on school district organization and I have made several efforts to try to do unification of the Dixie and San Rafael School Districts. There've always been reasons why it didn't happen. One of the reasons was there were many young teachers in the Dixie District and many older teachers in the San Rafael District and when you put the two districts together, and in the time we tried to do it there was declining enrollment, the Dixie District would have had their teachers lost. When I was on the San Rafael School Board we closed seven of twelve elementary schools. I must say I was the only one who was there for the closing of all seven schools. And the Dixie District had ten elementary schools and went down to three and now have four. So the Dixie District was the fastest declining enrollment district in the state. When this group of people, it all came at the same time, their students grew older, went off to the university and they were not replaced by as many children in the households. MG: So, things seem to be growing back though now. SB: They seem to be slowly growing back. However, people have been aging in place in  Page 6 of 23  Interview with Sue Beittel March 1, 2013 these communities of Terra Linda, Marinwood and Lucas Valley because of the nature of the housing. So it will maybe take a little more time before we have young families and much more diversified group of people have come to live here but one has to look at the fact that the cost of housing, even in Terra Linda, is very high. MG: How does the community compare now to the way it was when you first arrived, except for the demographics you mentioned. SB: It was a very, people knew each other and we had things like baby-sitting co-ops where we would, twenty families would not hire baby-sitters but would have an exchange program for taking care of kids. The, many of the husbands worked in San Francisco and so there was a lot of car-pooling. So the members of the carpool got to know each other very well, driving together to work three or four, five people riding together every day. So it was a much more social kind of thing. We often spent holidays together because many people had come from New York, from the Middle West, from other places and didn't have families here so that doesn't seem to be the case as it is now but then it's a little harder for me to tell because I'm of an age group. But it was a very sociable place and the kids made a lot of friends with others who were into that. There were also, in the pre-school days, a number of people who had pre-school programs. I remember an art program run by Sue Crammer on the other side of the valley that many kids, including mine, that went to. And there was a modern dance program at the local community center and that lovely lady, let's see her name was Anna, from Mill Valley. MG: Oh, Anna Halprin. SB: Anna Halprin. She provided us with one of her students and then Vera Olmstead was the pianist who played for us and she had been a concert pianist, was still a leader of the community, and lots of young ladies, especially pre-school students, took part in this program. So there were a lot of activities. In 1962, finally we built the swimming pool in the middle of the community and that was a meeting place in the summer time and also many of the students, the children, got involved in competitive swimming. MG: What kind of connection now do you have with, you say that a lot of people have remained here in the community, have those ties still, are they still in place? SB: Well, we used to see more of them at Scottie's Market, which was the original market in the area, and kind of a meeting place. I don't see so many of them there anymore and I sometimes wonder what has happened to people and I'm about to get involved in a program called Marin Village 94903, our zip code number, so maybe I can find them again. MG: I'm sure you will. SB: Yeah. MG: You mentioned Scottie's Market. What was that like back then? SB: We did most of our shopping there and it provided help to many community activities,   Page 7 of 23  Interview with Sue Beittel March 1, 2013 unbelievable help, financial, food, other things. It was a big part of the community. MG: Do you know who were the owners at that point? SB: I should remember their last names. It was an Italian family and I don't remember their names but, Steve I do remember, who was the last remaining member. It has been sold to another family. MG: Also back at the Dixie School, there was a archeological project that went on there. Can you talk about that? SB: This was a project called 4MRN138, and 4 standing for California one hundred thirty- eight Indian mounds found in California. It was a village site and interestingly enough, it was on the grounds of Miller Creek Middle School and an archeologist came from San Francisco State and began to excavate this site and an organization then grew from this, people who helped him or were interested in talking about the findings at this village site of Miwok Indians. MG: And who was the archeologist? SB: His name was, they used to call him Charlie, Charles Slaymaker, and he worked with a very interesting board led by Don Thieler and Sylvia Thalman and a number of other community people. I was on that original board. The role I played was the treasurer so I didn't have as much, I didn't actually dig in the Indian mound. I had a bad back actually. But, many people in the community did, under Charles, he instructed them about how to do it and many people got interested in archeology. There were a number of people who had done academic work in anthropology and were interested in this Indian mound. I had been interested in it for a long time. MG: And so, you said that there was an organization that grew out of this, what was that? SB: It was called the Miwok Archeological Preserve of Marin, MAPOM, and it had a board and had programs. And the biggest program was during the hundredth anniversary of San Rafael, I guess it was1970-something, and we had kids come from schools all over the area in San Rafael to visit the Indian mound. We gave docent talks about it and it was probably the one big reach out effort. MG: And ultimately there's a museum, I think made, perhaps in Novato, that grew out of this? SB: Probably. MG: Miwok Museum. SB: I've been to the museum but I don't have any relationship between the two. There were some things from the Indian mound that were exhibited at Miller Creek School and there are some cases there. I haven't been there for a while. I presume they are still there.   Page 8 of 23  Interview with Sue Beittel March 1, 2013 MG: It must have been very exciting for the kids to get in there and dig. Were there school children who were actually able to dig, too? SB: More adults in the community. I guess, I'd say that Charles Slaymaker wasn't too interested in instructing children. MG: I see. SB: But the people who did the digging were interested in talking with children about what these Indians were really like because there really had been some misinformation about the original Indians in the area and there was an effort to correct this. Don Thieler and Sylvia Thalman were especially involved that. MG: And the objects that they were able to dig up shed some light on the history of the Miwoks and the way they lived. SB: That's right and also in dating the times when the site had been occupied and what they ate, and there were burial remains at the site. They buried their dead at the site where they lived and there was some information pulled out about the housing and the ceremonial locations on the site. Not a very large site. One of the community members helped design this fence to go around it, Walt Van Gelder, and that fence is still there and it seems to me we had an open house almost every year though to bring people to the site and talk about what was going on. It was an important part of the community and, in addition to that, at that same location, the original Dixie School District had been moved to that site and so it was a way of connecting the archeological preserve with a trip to look at the one room school house which is still there. MG: The old Dixie School. SB: The old Dixie School House. It's on the same general property. MG: Right, right, yeah. So it's a way of helping people understand the history of the area, the children understanding the Miwoks. SB: Right. MG: That's wonderful. You also were on the Marin Education Fund Board, as I understand it. SB: Which is now called Ten Thousand Degrees and it was part of the Marin Community Foundation effort to help provide some financial assistance for people who were in need, going to college essentially. But we tried several programs in high school and in pre-school programs but ended up largely with a college scholarship program. MG: I would like to switch now from education to land use. If you have anything more you'd like to say about your education involvement at this point.   Page 9 of 23  Interview with Sue Beittel March 1, 2013 SB: Not really. I think we've got it. MG: Okay. Well you were part of the several different committees that were involved in city planning and county planning. Can you talk about how you got involved in doing those kinds of activities? SB: Well I've always been interested in people of various groups, low income people being able to have an opportunity to live in Marin so the issue of affordable housing probably got me into it as much as anything else. I've been involved with several affordable housing groups. My feeling is that people that work in the community ought to be able to live in the community and so that has taken me, you know, into this area and I've been interested in transportation, walking, biking and public transportation, and this is also involved with land use issues and I still continue that interest, working with a group at the League of Women Voters. MG: So, specifically when you were involved with the county plan for Marin, what kinds of issues were coming up that you had to deal with? SB: Well, you know, Marin County in 1973 did a wonderful plan that which is to set three corridors and that most of the development would occur in the urban corridor and set us out an agricultural corridor and a recreational corridor and so a lot of the work that we did at the League was try to preserve this and so it's largely a monitoring kind of thing to see that we do the right thing and maintain some of the good things that happened in the past. MG: What about when Terra Linda became part of San Rafael? What kind of issues were around at that time? SB: There were a number, there were several tries, to get Terra Linda to be part of San Rafael. It was kind of like the Dixie School District, we felt like we had a better school district. We felt we had a better climate for living than San Rafael which, at the time, had some people in elected office who had been there for many years and were not as flexible as we were and, but eventually they moved on and it became important to have fire service, police service and other things so this really brought about the connection and it's been a very positive kind of thing and there have always been people from North San Rafael elected to the San Rafael City Council. There were mayors from North San Rafael who lived near here. MG: Mayors? SB: Yes, Marilyn and Gary Phillips. MG: You were saying that the political situation changed in San Rafael to make it more flexible. Who were the new people that were, that came in that sort of enabled that change to happen? SB: Oh, certainly Larry Mulryan when he originally lived in Mt. Marin in North San Rafael then moved to central San Rafael, he was certainly one of those people. Jerry Lussem, who died   Page 10 of 23  Interview with Sue Beittel March 1, 2013 while he was in office, also lived in North San Rafael. So that we had pretty much of a change from the old-timers and it was a very healthy, healthy change. Formerly most of the business of the city council was done at breakfast before the meeting at night. The new people that came on board were better educated, understand what the public process was all about and so they were very, they made it much better to be part of San Rafael. SB: Of course, San Rafael had more financial resources than we had in this community. MG: And up until that point Terra Linda had been financed through a community district. SB: Community Services District. MG: A Community Services District through the county. SB: Right. Which, you know, was part of our property tax. We had some good people on it. My husband was on it for a while. Then, you know, they looked after fire, recreation and some other things but, you know, it was a healthy change that we made but it took a while to get there, to get all the ingredients right. MG: Were those volunteer positions on the city? SB: Yes, they were all volunteer positions. The, actually there's not a lot of money involved with various positions in San Rafael because San Rafael is a charter city and the charter is somewhat limiting, to the school board members for example, are not paid at all because that's in the city charter. There are a number of things in the city charter, that we have a separately elected mayor in San Rafael because of it. MG: I see. So, by a charter city you mean that it has a charter? SB: We are a charter city so we don't run under the same rules as other places in Marin County. San Francisco is a charter city and county and they are, the charter determines many things. MG: At one point you got involved in the North San Rafael Collation of Residence. Can you talk about that organization? SB: This was an organization of various homeowners' associations that got together to be more effective. It's still in existence but hasn't thrived the way it did under the great leadership actually of Shirley Fischer, who, it was her idea in the first place and she got some of us together, but we were able to talk about the San Rafael Vision which was one of the efforts of doing community planning by the Planning Department in the City of San Rafael and so we were able to provide some input. We also provided regular reports to the city council on one item or another. It was an organization of other organizations. MG: It seems like it would be something fairly effective given that North San Rafael has so   Page 11 of 23  Interview with Sue Beittel March 1, 2013 many different communities and neighborhoods. SB: It's true and also some of it is in the city and some of it's in the county because the whole Santa Venetia area. We think of North San Rafael as from Puerto Suello Hill to the border of Novato and so it's quite a diverse area. MG: And not all of that area is part of the City of San Rafael? SB: Not all of that area is part of the City of San Rafael but all of it was part of the North San Rafael Coalition of Residences so it kind of pulled all of those things together. It took strong leadership and it's a strong commitment to a democratic process and that kind of left leaders going on in their lives and kind of faded away to a certain extent. MG: And maybe now the issues are not as critical as they were back then. SB: Oh, I think they probably are but various homeowners' groups seem to carry on. They do their best when they object to things, which I object too. I think we should probably think about the good things and the bad to support them both when they're positive and object to them when they aren't. There is also a similar group that was formed in the rest of San Rafael called the Federation of San Rafael Neighborhoods, which was modeled after the North San Rafael Coalition of Residences. MG: Who were the people on the Planning Commission that initiated this democratic process of planning and visioning? SB: It mostly came with changes in staffing, new younger planners that came along. One was Ann Moore, who had been hired as a planner and became the Planning Director. She understood this process and was very important in the required general plan of the county and it was doing the General Plan that we had a lot of participation both under her leadership and under that of Bob Brown who followed and with various people who worked under them. MG: You know I've read about this North San Rafael Vision and it seems like it was a very extensive and comprehensive process. Can you talk about that? How it worked? SB: Well, it was extensive and comprehensive because the staff provided a lot of back ground material but there were many meetings and looking at various parts of the North San Rafael area that hadn't been fully developed, for example, the areas around the Civic Center. Kind of visioning how you saw the future of the community. One thing I learned from it was that people always wanted the area to be just like it was when they arrived. If they arrived early on, the one who arrived in the very first place like I did saw so many changes that we were better at seeing more change but people that came along the way didn't want anything changed very much and that is always very difficult. I think one of the things that people envisioned was easier ways to get around, for example some kind of walkway from Scotties' Market to the Civic Center. That's part of the vision, little pieces of it have been done but it's never been fully done.   Page 12 of 23  Interview with Sue Beittel March 1, 2013 MG: It's almost done now isn't it, if you go across the, what's the little piece that goes across the freeway now, by the cemetery. SB: Right, there's the Marindale over-crossing. Yeah, it's somewhat done but it could, it would require a certain amount of funding and I must say, bicycling has been part of it. Recently I've seen many more people riding along the bicycle areas, so that's good. MG: That there was also a plan to have a community center, as I recall. SB: Well, the plan was that we wouldn't do exactly a community center, but that the Northgate Shopping Center in the Northgate Mall would have to be the, have community center options for it and it does have Marin Links there and it also has a meeting room there but it doesn't quite work yet. We don't have that working out. We do have, of course, the community center in Terra Linda, the community center in Lucas Valley and the community center in Upper Lucas Valley. These probably work better for places for people to gather and then places like the Maria Freitas Senior Housing have a room that they make available on occasion. One can't forget to mention that the Presbyterian Church in the center of Terra Linda has been very generous about allowing groups to meet there. MG: I didn't realize that there was a community room or area at Northgate. SB: There is one on the second floor, it's right next to Marin Links office. MG: Interesting. SB: I haven't met there though but I know it's there. MG: So people, what percentage of the population would you say got involved in this visioning for North San Rafael? SB: A lot of people got involved in it. The City of San Rafael Planning Department reached out a lot to people and they provided excellent background material. A whole book of interesting things about the history of the area and what might be ahead. Unfortunately, there hasn't always been the resources to do the kind of thing that people envisioned. That's still to be done. MG: Yeah. SB: I would say. MG: I think one of the things I read they were planning to have a, markers along the promenade to say, historic markers. SB: Just to get the promenade in place, because the actual walking sidewalks are not anything special in much of the area. I happen to walk a lot, and they're narrow and they have tree roots and they're old now and there's a lot that could be done to make this a more walk-able   Page 13 of 23  Interview with Sue Beittel March 1, 2013 community. MG: Can you talk a little bit about the Del Ganado Ditch and the issues around that? SB: The Del Ganado Ditch was one of those places where a creek had separated the community there and it had a few Oleanders and a few other things growing but they got pretty decrepit and the people who lived there wanted to landscape it. There was never a consensus on actually taxing ourselves to do that but eventually negotiations with the City of San Rafael and some fund raising in the community did result in some up grading, not as much as the people might have liked. We've had some times recently when there has not been as much money available from the city as we might have wanted but there have been, there are volunteer days where people go out and do clean up in the community. MG: You know you were, I believe some of these county plans that you served on or worked on include the Silveira property. SB: Twenty years. MG: Twenty years you spent on that. Can you talk a little bit about how, what your thoughts are on that? SB: My thoughts are that if we're going to do any more building in Marin County, that the best place to do it is along the 101 Freeway and that if I had my dream, there would be another Redwoods with caregivers living there because I think it would be very appropriate for North San Rafael and the first time I was on that committee we all went around the room and said what you'd dream of and I have told you what I would. Another opportunity to have would be another good sized senior housing and to have a place where health care workers and caretakers might have an opportunity to live because the cost of living in Marin is too high. MG: Have you come across other places where they do have caregivers residing? SB: No, but that's been something in my head for a long time. MG: One of your dreams. SB: Right. MG: Well, it sounds like a very good idea, actually. What about the plan to have senior housing at the Grady ranch there. SB: Well, I have a hard time getting enthused about that, not because I don't want the senior housing but because it's about four miles from101 and I don't think I will do anything special to promote it or to, it seems to me that we could take that development, the development rights, and take them over to the Silveira Ranch so there is the best place to build some more and it would be a much better place there. I have let several people know that that's the way I feel. However   Page 14 of 23  Interview with Sue Beittel March 1, 2013 if Mr. Lucas is going to put a lot of resources into it, including transportation, we will see. MG: What about, you spent a lot of time with the San Rafael Housing Coalition– SB: Corporation MG: Corporation? SB: Which was a group of non-profit, it was an outgrowth of the Ecumenical Association for Housing, EAH. And it was to try to get us to identify some places where we might build some housing. The place that I got involved in was the school that was on Fifth Avenue that is now Rotary Manor and I was on the school board at the time and we were going to close that school, one of the seven schools, and the idea of converting that to housing became quite interesting and the Rotary Club became interested in it and they, indeed, worked with us on going forward. We certainly promoted the idea and then they even bought the property next door and built more housing. It was a very successful housing group project for lower income people. A number of retired teachers lived there. MG: What about Santa Isabella, the housing in that area? SB: That's within walking distance of my house and it was, had many suggestions of what it should be used for. One of them, for example, was for housing for people who taught at Dominican College, nuns, and they didn't want to live there. I think they preferred to live on campus and there were several other suggestions along the time. Until the empty land that was used mostly for dog walking needed to have, we once were going to have a library there, but there was no money to do a library. So this was appealing, let's see, Mercy Housing came up with the idea that we could get some public money and build something like fifty units and we had a good architect and took a while because there was one neighbor who loved it and one neighbor who hated it and the neighbor who hated it got many people listening to him but fortunately, the neighbor who loved it got some groups together and we looked at the plans, approved the plans and there it is. It's very well run and I think some happy people there. MG: It seems like there was a lot of controversy around it. SB: There was a lot of controversy. We went to court a couple of times. There was one land use attorney who lived a number of blocks away who took it to court. MG: And what was their objection this? SB: Oh, it would decrease the value of their housing in their neighborhood was one of them. Of course, it didn't do that. There are a number of people who lived in Terra Linda for many of years who live there now. I've had, I've been there a couple of times. I used to deliver newsletters for the Commission on Aging there and then I've been there to give a couple of talks at election time, for the League of Women voters on ballot measures and I've always had a very positive experience there with the people. And I do know the person, the community outreach   Page 15 of 23  Interview with Sue Beittel March 1, 2013  person. MG: Have you been involved in other senior housing developments in the county? SB: Well, I served on the Commission on Aging for five years recently and was the chairman last year. So, during the course of that time, I have visited many senior housing: Aldersly, Villa Marin. I've been to almost all the senior housing, I guess, and we have some really good housing. And it certainly allows for an option for people who do not feel they can age in place in their houses. They may not be appropriate or too far from rec–They don't drive anymore and it's too far away. MG: As long as there is enough of it. SB: As long as there is enough of it. MG: Yeah. SB: At the moment we're in pretty good shape but there's, you know, going to be some new senior housing in Novato at Warner Creek. It's coming along really well. And then we may have some in downtown San Rafael and so, it's something that's always in the works. We expect the senior community to be growing for a while yet but not forever. MG: So what motivated you to become on the board of the Commission on Aging, also I think you were president? SB: Last year, I was chairman for last year. MG: Well, it's interesting. My husband had done a lot of work with seniors. He was one of the founding members of Senior Access and served on the Commission on Aging. He still had some time left on his term when he died in ‘07, so I thought, "Oh, I'll just finish his term" and so I went to talked with the mayor, etc. and got appointed to that. It was an appointment by the city council and then I – MG: For San Rafael? SB: For San Rafael. For each city has one member appointed and then there are two elected by the council to represent them in Sacramento. So I served that term out and decided "This is kind of interesting" so I served another term but then a very nice woman from Terra Linda came along and she wanted to do it and she was very capable of doing it, so she got my place and it was time to retire. Also, I was getting pretty tired of going from Novato to Marin City to West Marin. It was a little more driving than I was comfortable with. MG: Because the meetings changed? SB: The meetings changed. They meet all over the county.  Page 16 of 23  Interview with Sue Beittel March 1, 2013 MG: I see. So, if we can move now from the housing to transportation. Before we do that is there anything you'd like to add about your experiences in working on the housing issues? SB: No, it's going to be on going. At the moment, my big interest is in what we call Plan Bay Area, which is the regional plan for housing which, in my opinion, will have some direct impact on climate change. That we need to plan the whole Bay Area in this respect. The environment is one of my, has been a big interest of mine through time. MG: So, there's been a lot of controversy recently about this regional planning and a lot of people who feel that it's sort of like big government telling the local governments what to do and how to do it and so forth but it appears you don't think that way. SB: I don't think that way. I don't see that there's any way that we can reduce green house gases in the nine Bay Area counties unless we do some planning on the total area and it maybe that the people at ABAG have been too direct about what they want and they haven't allowed for enough grass roots input to it, but I think that's a process thing and in the long run, we need to think about the total Bay Area. And we will be getting a plan from ABAG that will come out in March and it will be interesting. It also identifies areas to be built on and then areas to be saved and conserved and there will be money in both of those and there will also be rewards for transportation involved in it. So it's a carrot. There are some carrots out there for becoming part of this but I think AB32 and SB375 were the major accomplishments of Arnold Schwarzenegger's administration in Sacramento to reduce greenhouse gases fifteen per cent by 2035, which to me is a big issue. MG: So, what is your role exactly in working with the ABAG plans and so forth? Are you monitoring it, or – SB: I am. I used to go to the TAM meetings regularly, but I don't drive at night much anymore. Happily, I watch them on Channel 27, as I did last night. So I can see the whole meeting, hear it better that I could when I sat at the meetings. I don't have a chance to say anything but I'm not that anxious to say anything. MG: So you can really get a first hand view of what is going on without being there. SB: I do. I watch the monthly meetings. I sometimes go to the executive committee meetings, which meet in the afternoon. MG: So, what, I'm veering off from North San Rafael but I'd like to know your opinion about the freeway overpass that's going on, planned in Corte Madera. SB: I wish I had a good opinion of that. I sure can't understand that. It's very complicated and I hope somebody figures it out. I don't have any, I don't drive that area that much. I do have a very, I highly regard Diane Steinhouser. We're lucky to have her as head of TAM. I am, one of the things I do, I am on, the alternate on the Citizen's Oversight Committee for the expenditures of Measure A, which is the transportation money and they do make every effort to   Page 17 of 23  Interview with Sue Beittel March 1, 2013 explain these projects to us, however, I must say that I have a hard time with this project. It is definitely an engineering project. MG: So you're on the League of Voters, you're on the transportation committee. SB: I've served on that with the transportation, land use and housing committee. Co-chaired it at times and now I just serve on the committee and I'm about to do one more term on the board, one last time on the board. MG: And what kind of issues have Terra Linda experienced regarding transportation over the years? SB: Not enough buses. People who are in their homes and can no longer drive have a real problem. There are several programs available now, one of them being called "Catch-a Ride" which provides fourteen dollar help in taxi ride for people eighty and over or people who can't drive and are sixty and over. This is a new program with a vehicle license fee, Measure B, that passed. This has some help to it. There's also a rather active volunteer driver program where you have to get your own driver but you can reimburse him for the mileage and that's, works out of Whistle Stop and it has some help but mostly people who can't drive have to talked with the neighbors and find a ride. Some are eligible for Whistle Stop if they meet the requirements and there's a lot of activity in Whistle Stop, I mean, people that are disabled have real help with this and also with the Meals on Wheels Program where meals are delivered three times a week if they can't get out of the house and do their own shopping. But it's a problem when you age in place. MG: So that's one of the real changes you've seen in the community in the sense of when you started out it was all young families and now it's primarily– SB: Yeah, because many of these people have stayed in their houses as I have, having been in my house since 1961. MG: What about the SMART train? SB: Oh, I'm a big advocate of the SMART train, from the beginning. I had, I think that's, well eventually will help us so we don't have to expand Highway 101 anymore. I think it well be very pleasurable to be able to ride a train from Santa Rosa to, hopefully, Larkspur and connect up with the ferry. We certainly need more ways of connecting to the ferry including some shuttles, which didn't work in the past but may work now. I am, I worked on the measure when it was up on the ballot. In fact, I worked on it several times when it didn't pass and then finally, it did pass, but I'm looking forward, hope I'm still around to ride the train when it's on. I have ridden on a train on part of the area when we had one that came down on a temporary basis. One of the early projects I did with the North San Rafael Coalition of Residences was called "A Walk on the Tracks", which was to get us familiar with what it would be like and we walked from North San Rafael, Civic Center actually, into San Rafael right on the tracks to see what it would feel like coming into San Rafael.   Page 18 of 23  Interview with Sue Beittel March 1, 2013  MG: On the train. SB: On the train. Yes, it was a risky liability project, because we had about fifty people that showed up. MG: And what was it like to come into San Rafael? SB: It, you know, I have since walked on those tracks a number of times, you know, through the tunnel and into San Rafael. It's certainly an alternate to either being on 101 or being on Lincoln Avenue which has its limits. MG: Now another thing that North San Rafael Vision Group did, as I understand, is have a self-guided walking, a tour, an auto-tour of this area. SB: It was part of the visioning process and it was really to get people more familiar with process and to look at what the potential was for business, for housing, for recreation and that kind of thing because we're always looking for more parks and things, although we have a number and some of them have been enhanced by citizens like the park on Freitas where the Water Park is near Kaiser Hospital. With a number of people from the community really wanted that to happen and they raised some money and got, put some pressure on the city to have that happen. It's very nice. MG: How would, were you involved in the self-guided tour process? SB: I was on a committee but just as one person I didn't do any arranging or that kind of thing. I must say the staff did a notable job. They had written a little binder full of things that, background material for that. MG: The San Rafael Planning SB: The San Rafael, which in now called the Community Development Department. MG: I see. SB: They had some very good people working there. MG: Hum. If we could leave transportation now, is there anything you'd like to add in that? SB: No, my current interest is in senior mobility. That narrows it down. So I'll be working on that. MG: There's certainly a big need for that. As far as the environment goes, you also were on the board of the Audubon Society. SB: I was on the Conservation Committee of the Audubon Society almost during its founding  Page 19 of 23  Interview with Sue Beittel March 1, 2013 days and I was on that original group that took a week, a couple of our male members took a week's vacation, and explored all the places that people told us, there was Pickleweed so we could map out all the wetlands in Marin. It was an original Wetlands Project of Marin. I remember that happily. It was many years ago. I can't even remember what year. The other people are gone away that worked on that. MG: Was that in the years where they brought the Reed House over to – SB: It was probably a little after that. MG: Richardson Bay. SB: It was probably a little after that. One of the key people was George Ellman, he had been the mayor of Tiburon at one time and he was one of those people who took a week's vacation. What we did was before the days of environmental impact reports because the little booklet that we made out of this week's exploration became kind of the start-up of what people used for environmental impact reports because we had identified quite a few places. We talked to a lot of people before we started in this project and they were places that we needed to not develop, to preserve and – MG: What kind of people would you talk to? SB: Oh, mostly people who belonged to Marin Conservation League, Marin Audubon, those people who were out and observed marshes and wetlands and knew how important they were because so much had been covered in the whole Bay Area and some of it had been covered for agriculture and that kind of thing. MG: What other environmental activities have you been involved with in over the years? SB: Well, some of it in the areas of education, in terms of outdoor education for kids in school. Less so recently, part of it is because there were other people, lots of other people, doing this kind of work. I, let's see, served on the Conservation Committee of Marin Audubon and was on the Transportation Committee of the Marin Conservation League for a number of years. MG: You said you had come from Kentucky? SB: We came here from Kentucky. MG: Where were you originally from? SB: Originally from New Haven, Connecticut, went to school in Ohio, my big movement out of New England, we Wedemeyers didn't move very fast. MG: Did you ever think, when you were young, that you would become an activist as you have?   Page 20 of 23  Interview with Sue Beittel March 1, 2013 SB: Not particularly, I was always relatively active in high school but I don't know how I got to that. I guess, I actually thought of myself as becoming a scientist. That opportunity didn't come. MG: And that opportunity didn't come because? SB: Well, I worked my husband's way through medical school among other things. So I went to work after I graduated, did under-graduate work. Worked in the area of science but then let him take over. MG: I understand that you had a bumper sticker on your car that says "Democracy is not a spectator sport." SB: I believe greatly in it. The poor thing disintegrated so I had to take it off very recently, but I like that message. MG: It seems like you've really lived that message in your life. SB: I have. And it's interesting how, my kids have done the same thing, which I find very interesting. They shunned it for a while, you know, when they went through that middle stage but now my daughter's just finished doing a campaign for a very good person in Hawaii and won. MG: And had you been actively like that when you were a teenager or in college? SB: I don't know that I was that active. I was relatively active in college but I took a rather, I had my hands full with the academic work that I was doing. I went to a college that had a work- study program. That was why I became terribly interested in vocational education. So it was a five- year college education and you had to work a hundred weeks in a regular job that you got one credit per week for and so I had worked at a number of chemical companies. MG: A hundred weeks is quite a bit of time. SB: Yeah. A hundred weeks is quite a bit of time and it was a rather innovative program. It also got me very interested in more innovative types of education. And hands-on education. At one time we had a very good summer school program, when my kids were there, for hands-on education during summer school, doing some more innovative things. MG: At the Dixie School? SB: At the Dixie School. Yeah, but it went away with money. MG: You've also, I've read, have three rules of thumb: tenacity, collaboration and compromise.   Page 21 of 23  Interview with Sue Beittel March 1, 2013  SB: I agree with all those things. MG: So how is it that you've been able to navigate and become affective in all the different areas that you have over the years? SB: Well, sometimes I know how to lose one, for example, numerous times have I attempted to get involved with the Dixie and San Rafael District, getting into a long term relationship and each time that it doesn't succeed I kind of step back and say "Oh well, there'll be another time" and maybe it will happen sometime. It's not a big issue but it would be, it would add a good dimension to the community, I think. And there have been other things like that, the SMART train, which I worked on from the very beginning and eventually even St. Vincent-Silveira will have something good happen to it, especially on the Silveira property. MG: So you have a lot of tolerance for frustration. SB: There'll be a new day. MG: Well is there anything you'd like to add to what we've talked about? SB: No. We've talked about a whole lot. I don't know where you found all this information about me, my inner-self. MG: Well, you've done quite a bit. I also want to mention that you were awarded the Richard T. O'Brian Citizen of the Year for San Rafael in 1997, I believe, which was the first – SB: No, it was in 2002, I think. MG: 2002. SB: I think it was, something like that. MG: Well it was the first award of that award. SB: Yeah, it was during an early time. I had worked with Richard O'Brian on a ballot measure. We didn't always agree but we knew each other. MG: So you must have worked with numerous people around the county over the years. SB: And very happily with some. Al Boro, the mayor of San Rafael. I consider myself lucky to have been able to work with him. MG: Was he one of the people that moved in that made it more flexible to work with in San Rafael? SB: Absolutely. He had a wonderful sense of listening to the community and a sense of what  Page 22 of 23  Interview with Sue Beittel March 1, 2013 you'd had to do in order to move forward. MG: Yeah. SB: Each one of the people that you had to work with is a mentor for your own thing, certainly Al. MG: Well. I'd like to thank you for your time. We appreciate it.
MarinCounty;Helen Thompson Dreyfus;Edited by Marilyn L. Geary Helen Thompson Dreyfus, niece of the author Kathleen Norris, recalls the personalities and dynamics of the close-knit Thompson family, their Mill Valley family home called Treehaven, and summers at La Estancia, the Norris’ ranch in Saratoga. You can read more about this big Irish family in James Thompson’s Scenes of My Childhood, in Helen Thompson Dreyfus’ memoir Always Afternoon, and in Kathleen Norris’ memoir The Family Gathering. You may enjoy reading and listening to this oral history on the California Room's Digital Archive. *These photographs are property of the Mill Valley Public Library. They may not be reproduced in any form without the express written permission of the Library.            Joseph, Margaret, Kathleen, Jim, Teresa, Fred in Mill Valley, 1901*   My great-grandmother was an Irish woman named Kathleen O’Keefe, who lived in Cork, Ireland. Her brothers made a match for her with an American sea captain, and she married him. He went right off to sea as soon as they were married in Ireland. She came out to meet him in what was then known as the Sandwich Islands in Hawaii, but by the time she got to Hawaii, he had vanished. His ship was presumably lost, and nobody ever knew what became of him. Although my great-grandmother was young and a country Irish woman, she was a strong-minded girl. She wrote the Pope and asked that since the marriage had never been consummated, could she have a lesser period of time to presume death? Eventually, about a year later, if you can imagine such a long while, she got a letter allowing her to marry within three and a half years instead of seven. She also wrote Lloyd's of London who said they had no record whatsoever as what had become of the ship, so she was fairly in the clear. My great-grandfather had been, more or less, I think, sent to the Hawaiian Islands to get him out of the way, because he was kind of wild. He auctioned off the cargo of ships when they arrived in Honolulu. In those days there weren’t shops. The ships would come in, and he would say, “Here’s yard goods,” or pots and pans or whatever. He was a very witty auctioneer. We were always told that he died acting as a second in a duel, but we’ve always suspected that he was probably acting as a first. By that time they had two children, my grandfather and his sister, my great Aunt Kitty. My great grandmother decided that there were altogether too many Protestants in the Hawaiian Islands. As you know, it was mostly settled by Methodist Missionaries, and that was no place to bring up children, because they might marry Protestants! And so she took them off to Ireland. By ship to China and then overland across Russia. Imagine! Well, this was about the middle of the last century, 1850, somewhere along in there. She got the family all home to Ireland and then didn't want to stay in Ireland and went back to Hawaii by ship with two little kids. I believe it was on that trip that they were storm-strayed and the biscuits all had weevils in them. When the children complained, their mother said, “Well, if you won’t eat them with the candle, I’ll blow the candle out, and you can eat them in the dark.” But then she didn’t say in Hawaii. She came to San Francisco and ran a boarding house for many years, very successfully. She was really a very strong-minded woman. She did all her own shopping. She went down to the market every day with big baskets and sent the baskets home by Chinese boys to the boarding house. I remember being told that she said to one boarder, “If you stir your coffee, Mr. Johnson, you don’t have to put so much sugar in it." The strong women in those days just did it and didn’t think they were so remarkable either. I mean I don’t think that Kathleen O'Keefe Thompson thought it was terribly astonishing that she crossed the Pacific a couple of times, crossed Russia in the middle eighties. I mean she didn’t go around boasting about it at all, you know. That was just what she did to get the kids home to Ireland. Do you know they used to send their laundry to   Josephine Moroney*  China in those days from the Hawaiian Islands? Imagine how much laundry you’d have to have to be able to do that, because it would be three months before you got it back. James Alden Thompson, the son, grew up and married Josephine Moroney, whose family came across the plains and settled in Marysville. There were thirteen children in that family. I don’t think they were all born before they came across the plains. They were supposed to be in the same party that the Donner party was in, but the Donner party went off to the south and the party that the Thompson’s were in came on through to Oregon and then down to Marysville. Another little story about my grandfather which I’ve always loved was that, of course, he was raised as a child in Hawaii and later when he had two children of his own, he had taken my Aunt Kay and my Uncle Joe to the World’s Fair. This must have been in about 1895. At the World’s Fair, there was a village of Hawaiians that somebody had imported. You know, one of those dreadful things. And the poor things! The person who had imported them had died, and nobody else spoke Hawaiian in the whole of San Francisco. They were starving to death. They were helpless, because they didn’t speak English. My grandfather, walking by with his two children, said a few kindly words in Hawaiian, and they all burst into tears and came and flung their arms around him. Because he spoke Hawaiian, he became the patron of that little Hawaiian village for the rest of the Fair. My grandfather came to Marin County, Mill Valley, and he built his home in 1891. The original lot sale in Mill Valley was in 1890, and they bought property at that time and then built and moved their family over. At that time, my grandfather and grandmother built the house in Mill Valley which was known as Treehaven. It is still there, what is now 123 Molino Avenue. They raised their children there. My aunt was then eleven by the time they built that house, so they had their family all started by then. I don’t know where they had lived in San Francisco. They went to the little school in Mill Valley. There were six children in the Thompson family, or four of school age. They had to wait until there were nine children of school age in Mill Valley before there could be a school. So the Coffin family finally moved in with four children and that jumped them over the mark. There was a little tiny school down just off Throckmorton Avenue and then not long after that the school on Summit Avenue was built, which was the Summit Avenue school. My grandmother kept a journal. The youngest uncle, Jimmy Thompson, wrote a book later called Scenes of My Childhood. He used her journal considerably as his data bank. That is certainly out of date. There was a period in San Francisco when certain families would have private printings, maybe two hundred copies, of the story of their family, but we were never in that lofty a financial position, I don’t think.  Joseph Joseph Sexton Thompson was the oldest. He was named after his father, obviously. Then Kathleen Thompson, Teresa Thompson, and Frederick Thompson (my father), and then Margaret Thompson and James. My grandfather worked at the Bank of California all his life, but he didn’t last terribly long. I don't think he lived to see the new century. He and my grandmother both died within a month of each other in about 1898. They always said he died of a broken heart, and I wouldn’t be surprised. His wife died at Thanksgiving, and he died at Christmas. It really ruined those holidays for the family for the rest of their lives. So they left six kids, the oldest, Joseph, about nineteen. They all were about a year and a half apart, quite a real good Irish Catholic family, six kids and the little spinster sister, my grandfather’s sister Kitty Thompson, who never married. She was kind of the chaperone for the family. They moved to the city. They had to get jobs in the city. My father got a job as a night watchman in a warehouse, and his shoes had such big holes in them that he used to take lots and lots of cardboard and cut out soles that he kept fitting into them to keep his feet dry. My father was thirteen when they moved to San Francisco. After their parents died, the family stuck together in an apartment somewhere in San Francisco. There was a great family loyalty and support. Everything centered around the family. But the result of the whole thing was that none of them had a higher education. Joe was already working, I guess, at the time his father died. My father never went through fifth grade, and none of the family ever got out of grammar school. But it was one of those families that does a lot of reading. There was a lot of sitting around the fire at night, reading aloud and discussing things, memorizing poetry. So they all were all regarded as educated people, where none of them were learned in the normal sense. Dad was the authority on Shakespeare at the Bohemian Club, and I don’t think most of them knew he never went through fifth grade. Kathleen The first thing Kathleen ever wrote was a book called Mother. She was just seventeen or so when her mother died. A few years later she wrote this book, and she sent it to a number of publishing houses and was turned down by all of them. And I’m quite sure, although I don’t think I’ve ever heard this specifically, that my Uncle Cigi, Charles G. Norris, whom she later married, Frank Norris’ brother, was a dynamo, and I’m sure that he took her over. Once she married him, she never had any trouble selling any of her books, and she wrote something like sixty. He did all the dealing for her and made sure that it got the right kind of advertising. Mr. Bigelow of Good Housekeeping magazine told me once that her name on the cover of Good Housekeeping magazine would sell fifty thousand of his magazines.  She wrote very straight books about nice decent girls that almost go wrong and then just come around. She was extremely witty, and she could be very, very sharp and very, very critical, always in a devastatingly funny way. She was the kind of person that Noel Coward loved to be with, because they just sparked each other on. Terribly funny. It’s hard to recreate that kind of humor.   Treehaven, 1897 * She was a big woman with a big Roman nose and thick curly dark hair. As she got older she got better looking. As a girl she was homely. Really, she had this big nose and big bust and very slender hands and feet. This story was in the book, but I’ll tell it. She was complaining once about being homely. Everybody else was prettier. Her father said, “Katie, the prettiest girl in the room has only got a twenty minute lead on you.” And that was really true. By the end of twenty minutes, nobody would be listening to the prettiest girl in the room, and everybody would be talking to Aunt Kay. As she got older, that all came into focus. It’s alright for a woman of fifty to have a large bust and a large Roman nose. It just isn’t very pretty on a seventeen year old. She was a striking woman, bright blue eyes, and she had that Irish realism among other things. One of her sayings was, “People say I shouldn't speak ill of the dead.” She said, “Keep peace with the living, speak ill of the dead.” Very useful sometimes. When Cigi married her, he said, “Well now, Kathleen. I love you dearly, and we’re going to be married, but I don’t want to marry your goddamn family.” The poor man, he never got out from under that family to his dying day. They had a place in Saratoga for the whole family. They went every summer, for the whole summer. There were fifteen or twenty nieces and nephews around all summer long. Brothers and sisters and brothers’ wives. And Cigi ran the whole family, too, lending money to this one and making a contact for that one. He was a remarkable man, Charles Norris. Kathleen married him at an early age. She was writing society notes for one of the San Francisco papers when she met him as a reporter at a party where he was a guest. He was at a much higher social level. He was entranced by her from the moment he saw her, and he wore her down. Charles Norris was a Californian. They went to New York, and he worked for Scribner’s for a number of years and possibly she did too. I really never knew him until the last summer of World War I when they had a great big place in Mount Holly, New Jersey. Charles Norris was at Fort Dix, and they took this big old marvelous Victorian house out in the country near Mount Holly and invited all the family, of course. So Fred and his wife and his two kids came, and Teresa and her husband and her three kids came and Markie and her husband and two kids came, and there were about four maids of all  types of race: one black, one Irish, one German, and it was such a marvelous summer. This great big house and big barn but full of relatives and children and poor Uncle Cigi.  My father use to tease Uncle Cigi by calling him Charlie, so I'd always heard him referred to as Uncle Charlie. When I first got out of the car, and I said, “Hello Uncle Charlie,” he said, “Goddamnit. Don’t call me Charlie.” They lived in Port Washington. Aunt Kay had another baby that died. They adopted an older boy who was a son of the maid or somebody who lived with them most of their lives. Her sister Teresa moved out to Port Washington with her family too, so there was another family scene. Kathleen Norris, 1925*  Aunt Kay had a son, who is four or five years younger than I am. He’s Doctor Frank Morris in San Francisco. Kathleen lived to be pretty close to ninety. First they moved out in the summers to Saratoga, and then they built a house when their son got up to be college age and he was going to Stanford. They built a big house in Palo Alto that Claire Boothe Luce later bought a very icehouse. Then after my uncle died, Aunt Kay moved to San Francisco. Uncle Charlie died about seven years before she did. She moved then to San Francisco to the house up on Twin Peaks and lived there for a few years. Then when she was beginning to get pretty old, she went into St. Mary’s Hospital and finally moved to her son’s house out on Pacific Avenue and died there. I don’t believe Teresa assisted my Aunt Kay in her writing. I don’t think Aunt Kay needed that kind of assistance. Her writing just flowed The editor of Good Housekeeping magazine told me once he had been sitting in her room while she was typing, working. He was talking to my uncle, and she was writing. One of the children came in and said to Aunt Kay that nobody could find a swimming suit for somebody or something. She got up and went right out of the room. While she was out of the room, the editor of the Good Housekeeping, whose name I now forget, went over and looked at her typewriter. She had started a word that began with “wh,” and when she came back in the room, she just sat right down and finished it and went on. She didn’t look a bit and think what have I been saying. She knew that she had “which” started, and she just went on and finished it. Kathleen and Charles* By the time I knew her, she used the typewriter. She may have started by hand. I guess she probably did. She was a morning writer, the whole life of the household went on in and out. The kittens were born, and the kids brought them in, and children brought their fights in, and she settled them. Uncle Cigi, on the other hand, was a “don’t bother me writer.” He went up to a special cabin about a    quarter of a mile away and worked terribly hard all morning. And he worked just nine to twelve. She worked only in the mornings as far as I can ever remember, but she did a lot of other things too while she was working. Nobody ever thought that they shouldn’t bother Aunt Kay. She published very close to the end. She wrote right along. It was as easy as talking to her. Aunt Kay was a very easy grownup to be close to because she liked kids. She was funny, and she didn’t make a lot of rules. She just went along the way I’m painted because it was so much more fun to go that way. She didn’t have to make rules. She had fourteen nieces and nephews, I think. None of us had very interesting pursuits. She just hoped we would do well. But she herself had a great many pursuits. She spoke up and down the nation for the Volstead Act for the ratification of the Prohibition Amendment. She was an ardent platform speaker for peace and spoke for peace  organizations anywhere. *  The interesting thing about her in relation to the Prohibition Amendment was that she was all out for Prohibition. She had seen one of her uncle's become an alcoholic. All the while she was out for Prohibition and all during Prohibition when she was strongly for it, my uncle was a dedicated drinker. He was a gentlemanly drinker, but he’d never thought of having a dinner without having liquor. Aunt Kay would sit there with all of us drinking, not, I suppose, the little children, but with her husband drinking, and wine and a lot of conversation and cocktails. Then she’d go off and make a speech about the Volstead Act. And neither of them ever suggested to each other that one or the other should stop whatever it was they were doing. Well, I’ll tell you a kind of a funny little story about Kathleen. She spoke at a Community Chest luncheon in San Francisco one time and invited all of the cousins to come and hear her. We had a table, and it was a very pleasant luncheon. Aunt Kay was an unrealistic woman in some ways, and she said that thanks to the Community Chest, there was really no poverty left in America anymore. She said, “Even destitution in America isn’t as bad as it is in some places.” One of my great darling cousins was sitting right across the table from me, Teresa’s oldest child. I said I thought destitution was a word like zero, and my cousin Rosie took a pencil and paper and started writing right away. A minute later, she handed across the table a paper that said: There is poverty in London. There is poverty in Rome. But we have democratic destitution here at home. There is misery in South Hampton, And they make no retribution.   Kathleen Norris looks over script at "Pickfair" with Douglas Fairbanks and Mary Pickford.*  But we are happy, proud and gay, We raise our banners high and say, 'We're happy in the American way With American destitution. And she did that in a minute. Another thing about Aunt Kathleen, speaking of writing poetry in a minute, she developed a habit of going to that silver store in San Francisco, Shreeve’s, and ordering a very pretty silver bowl and then standing there at the counter and saying, “Let’s see. That child’s name is Richard, "and writing charming poems that were then engraved around that silver bowl. And everybody who has those silver bowls just treasures them. At one time I tried to collect all of them to make a present to her. I couldn’t get them all. There were just too many, but they were delightful bowls, and each one was tailored to the child. To Markie Thompson, to this daughter on her bowl, she said: Well-mannered children and sedate, May eat from off a china plate, But for a child as wild as you, This useful silver bowl must do. Teresa Teresa was a wonderful woman. Among other things she had total recall. She could remember pretty near anything she’d ever read, exactly. But she also wanted to become a nun, and she became Little Sister of the Poor when she got along to be, I suppose, about 23 or so. I don’t know exactly when. She became very sick and had to leave the Little Sisters of the Poor, and then she decided she would become a Carmelite in London, so she went off to London to become a Carmelite Nun. She really was an extremely devout young woman, but life with the Carmelites was just too much. For instance, she said one day to one of the superior nuns how much she liked the nice big, black buns that they got for lunch. They never had them again, because you’re not supposed to like buns. You should spend your time liking cheeses, but not buns. She said at one time there was a little weed growing in the courtyard where they exercised. They’d admire it as they went by it. The girls all loved that little weed, but none of them ever mentioned that they loved that little weed because they knew it would be torn up. My aunt had a rather large handwriting, and she wrote pages of letters to her sister. The Carmelites would only let her have one page. All the rest of the pages were thrown away. So she reduced her handwriting to a perfectly beautiful little copperplate handwriting. If you’ve ever seen her handwriting, it's beautiful, but it’s tiny, so she could get pages into one page. Carmelites don’t put Thompsons down very easily. Well, finally this became too difficult. My Aunt Teresa in her novice’s habit went to the Mother Superior and said that she didn’t feel that she had a true vocation and she wanted to leave. The Mother Superior said, “Very well, Sister. If you want to leave, you may leave now. Right now. This minute. If you don’t want to leave now, you will stay,  but if you want to leave, leave now.” And Aunt Teresa in her novice’s habit got up and walked out of the room into the streets of London without a penny to her name. Of course, I won’t say that she wasn’t quite as brave as I said because she did know that the family knew a family that lived in London, but she didn’t know where they lived or where she was. She had no money. She found the family, and they were all away, but the housekeeper of the family wired my Aunt Kay. The cable just said, “Teresa Out.” This well-to-do family in London, another big Irish family like ours, probably shipped her home. She came home, and she worked at Paul Elder’s. She was fascinated being around books. Teresa met William Rose Benet at Paul Elder's, and that was another romance. But they were not married very long. She died. She was not a child when she met him. She died in the flu year 1918-19, leaving three children and a widower. Two of the children are in this area. Her oldest boy is James Benet, whom you may have seen on News Room. He was sort of the education specialist on News Room, when there was still a News Room. Her daughter Rosemary married a young man name Dawson many years ago, and she lives in San Francisco. Those two both live in San Francisco. The youngest daughter died of a cerebral hemorrhage about ten years ago. Her marriage was short because of her early demise. She was married about six years or so. Frederick (Helen’s Father) Frederick was the businessman of the family. He was raised in Mill Valley until the parents died, and then they went to the city. The earliest story I really know about him was that his father came home from the city once and passing the cigar store, which was in front of the pool hall, he stopped to buy a cigar. He looked over the counter and saw his eleven year old son playing pool. He said, “Freddie, where do you get the money to play pool?” And Fred said, “Well, the thing is, Dad, I play for the house.” He was so good by that time. He went on playing pool and billiards and poker and supported the family sometimes in this way. He became a very successful businessman in his later years, and I’m sure that it was partly due to a very down-to-earth experience as a small boy. But that was one of the reasons he quit school, because he was playing pool. My mother’s name was Helen Meigs, and my father met her brother first. They both lived in a boarding house in San Francisco, and then Mother lived in Santa Barbara. My father came to visit, and they fell in love and married. That was slightly romantic. They were attracted to each other. I guess they were already engaged when he went to El Paso and came down with diphtheria. Mother went out to nurse him in a convent or a religious institution of some kind, and then her mother went out and then they got   James Alden Thompson with Teresa, Jim, Kathleen, Margaret, 1898*  married. They were married in the hospital there. That lasted quite awhile. I have a younger brother named David. Josephine Thompson gazes up at her children. Left to right: Joseph, Jim, Fred, Teresa, Kathleen and Margaret, c. 1893* Mother and Dad lived in Mill Valley most of their married life. There were a few times out for Dad's business affairs. Mother fit in to the family very well. The in-laws all fit in very well. Aunt Kay was a great one for gathering people in. She could say savage things about people, behind their backs or to their faces, but it didn’t destroy the relationships somehow. We all would say terrible things about each other. Margaret We always called Margaret "Markie." She married a young man named Hartigan who wound up as an Admiral in the Navy, and she had two children. They lived in Peking in a compound with something like fifty servants at one time. They had chit boys, a hired person who only carried your messages around. She always traveled with several cats and several dogs. She was a great beauty, and she was also a darling and funny woman. But not only were the children intrigued with her, practically everyman she ever met was intrigued with her, because she was just so darling and lovely and pretty and funny. Then they lived for several years in Rio. He would be sent places with the Navy, so that her daughter still has a slight Portuguese accent, you know, that sort of international accent that some people have. It’s quite an accent. For many, many years Bunga would use expressions that were really Portuguese in flavor. Hartigan was a Naval attaché in Peking and, I guess, in Rio, and then he later had the Relief, the hospital ship Relief. I remember going to a nice party he gave on that ship once, and my great aunt, my grandmother’s sister Mary Moroney, who was an odd one too, said, “Now this is the sort of place I’d like to live.” We were on the Relief out in the middle of San Francisco Bay. “Flags and bunting,” she’d say. Really, who wouldn’t, you know? She was one of the family characters, and I know nobody ever talked about her. She was a fine concert pianist and an absolute fat head. Her name was Mary Moroney, and she later married a man named Thompson. For instance, Chaliapin admired her playing, so he asked her to accompany him while he   practiced. She did for a month, and then she sent him a bill for “coaching.” Chaliapin crossed out “coaching” and wrote "accompanying” and sent her her check. Then she crossed out “accompanying” and wrote in “coaching" and sent him back his check, and that was the last she ever heard of Chaliapin. Can you imagine being such a fool? But then she was the one that thought she’d like to live in sunshine, flags, and bunting. My Aunt Kay was driving her down from the Fairmont one day and went into a frightful skid and skidded about half a block sideways. My Aunt Mary said, “Kathleen, what is skidding?” She thought she might would like to find out what "skidding" was. This might be it. But she was far from screaming, “Kathleen what is skidding?” Admiral Hartigan died some years ago, fifteen years or so, and Margaret died only a couple of years ago. She was one of the younger ones. She died in a absolutely entrancing little tiny house in Georgetown, Washington, D.C. It had at one time been part of the Thomas Jefferson Estate, and she had restored it into sort of a mint condition. She did that, and she must have restored at least six houses in Georgetown. She belonged to one of the very first middle class families to move out to Georgetown way back at the time of World War I, when it was mostly darling old brick houses that were gone down to the working class and black population. She being an ingenious, young, impoverished Navy wife, bought one of these old houses, which was called the Gun Barrel House because the front fence was made of Civil War gun barrels. She just made it into a showplace, and then people begun buying and doing that to other houses in Georgetown. But she was one of the first, way, way in the vanguard. I remember her saying that walking to church one terrible snowy morning, she had to walk past a group of men that were standing on the corner, all very rough-looking, working class men. She kind of nerved herself to go past them,. and as she went past them, she heard one of them say, “I was up walking that little kid the whole night long.” Nothing to be afraid of in this group of men. She never was afraid of her neighbors again. James James was the baby, and therefore he was the one who was closest to our age. We all just adored him because he was terribly, terribly funny. He was just a daringly funny man. Just as an example, at the Saratoga Ranch, there was a lovely redwood grove, and we had breakfast there in the mornings. There were big tables and a beautiful outdoor barbecue. One morning Aunt Kay said, “My, it’s a lovely hot Sunday. What can we do that would be exciting for the kids today?” and Uncle Jimmy said, “Put an alligator in the pool.” That was the kind of funny that he was, and we adored it. James wrote his reminiscences of the whole family when they were children in Mill Valley in his book Scenes of my Childhood. My grandparents built Treehaven in Mill Valley in 1891. After their parents died, I believe the children sold Treehaven and then they must have bought it back. They sold it just after their father died when they had no money. Then they must have bought it back, because later my Uncle Joe lived there  with his wife and child and then my Uncle Jimmy lived therefore a number of years. I just ran across a reference the other day to the fact that they had sold it for twenty three hundred dollars. Jimmy Thompson finally sold it to some people named Theiss, who live there now. Jim, Kathleen, Joe, Mark, Fred, at La Estancia, 1925* James Thompson worked all his working life for his older brother Joseph, who had a thing called the Federal Electrical Manufacturing Company. It manufactured switch gear. As I say, James was the Treasurer. But he no more belonged in that business. He wrote a book with great pains about Count Rumford, who was a sort of a peripheral relative somewhere. He should have written really, Jimmy, but he didn’t get started at it young enough, and he married quite young. The family married him off sort of, because he was down in Panama having a lovely time. I don’t know what he was doing, but he was working. They decided that he should marry and married him off to a kind of driving Irish Catholic girl named Margaret Carrigan of the Dunn and Carrigan and Hayden family. They had three beautiful daughters and had a perfectly happy life, but he had to support the family. I guess that was all he could do. All the brothers were different. Joe was a happy, inventor kind. He told me he never invented anything, but he put things together in ways they hadn’t been put. The result was he had many patents and was very successful, but he was no businessman. My father was a very good businessman. Jimmy shouldn’t have been in business at all. He was totally lost and didn’t like it. He should have been, I don’t know what, maybe a writer. He tried all his life to write. It was a family of six grownups, and they all had children. There aren’t many families that have six kids anymore, but those that do are very close. I know one family with six children, and they’re in and out of each other’s lives a great deal. La Estancia We considered the Saratoga ranch heaven on earth. It was an old prune ranch, so that there were still a good many prune trees. The Norris’ took over the house, and then they built cottages all around for the overflow of guests. It was called La Estancia, The Place, The Ranch Place. It had a gigantic croquet lawn with lights and with one of the first   remote control music situations I’ve ever heard. You could play the records from the redwood trees at the foot of the lawn. It had a tennis court and a pool. It had this grove where we ate, and eventually every family had their own cabin. There would be Markie’s cabin and Frank's cabin and the boys’ cabin. Uncle Cigi made rules. You must be in for breakfast at eight o’clock in the morning. And in order to insure that, he would put extraordinarily loud band music or something on the phonograph and blast it over the entire area. One morning I woke up to this frightful noise. He had gotten somewhere a crowd record of an angry mob, and it sounded as if they were on our very heels.  On time for meals, that was absolute, and that was about the only real rule I should say that we had. When we were up at the grove, we ate a great many meals there as years went by. We all worked at it. We either did dishes, or we chopped lettuce or whatever, but Uncle Cigi and Aunt Kay supported the whole thing. They had a cook and a butler and a good many gardeners and a couple of maids and all kinds of staff. My Uncle Cigi was an organizer. I can still see him in the hot, hot sunshine counting the laundry on Monday before it was sent out: six hundred and forty two napkins or whatever. The laundry room was a giant room. It was a wonderful place, the whole family. There were no horses. There were some donkeys, but nobody paid much attention. The great thing about it was that everybody played. Everybody did everything. If we played sardines at night, everybody played sardines at night, hid in the dark, from the little kids to the old. And if we were doing charades, everybody was doing charades, so that there was never any feelings that there was an age gap at all in that family. It wouldn’t have occurred to any of us that Aunt Kay or the baby weren't just as useful in a charades game. There were all kinds of other people there: Alexander Woollcott and Harpo Marx and Frances Parkinson Keyes. Since I don’t think this is going to get wide publicity, I’ll tell you that we all disliked Frances Parkinson Keyes extremely. She was very arrogant. She had a son who was about 22, and she treated him like a five-year-old, and we didn’t like it. So that we kept calling her Mrs. eyes, and she'd say, “No, no dear. Eyes with a K, eyes with a K.” I can still hear her the day she left, all of us standing on the porch saying, “Goodbye Mrs. Keys” at the top of our lungs. There were endless guests. People like Templeton Parker and Charles Dolbie. Oh, I couldn’t remember them all. A funny thing happened once. When the men went to the Bohemian Club, their remaining ladies would all go down to the ranch with the family ladies of whom there were about seven or eight. They would continue to dress nicely for  Treehaven, c. 1950*  dinner and sit around and play bridge after dinner. Three or four of them were very pretty.  
MarinCounty;Rose Briones;CE: Today is Friday, July 29th, 1977. And continuing the Oral History Program at the California Room at the Marin County Library at Civic Center, this is Carla Ehat. And joining me today is Mrs. Thomas Kent. And we have the pleasure of meeting today with Rose Briones, who resides in Woodville, very close to Bolinas. RB: Just three miles out of Bolinas. CE: Three miles. Now Rose, you are the granddaughter of Gregorio Briones. Is that correct? RB: Yes. CE: And your grandfather at one time had one of the original land grants in Marin County. And the rancho was right here: Rancho Los Baulines. Tell us, when you were born, Rose, and where? RB: I was born here, in the two gable house, up the road here, by the creek and I was born there. CE: And in what year, Rose? 1883? RB: 1883. CE: 1883, heavens. RB: See, I'm pretty old. I’m -- CE: 94. RB: Yes. CE: You're in wonderful condition. RB: I live all alone here. I do all my work, laundry and everything for myself.           AK: You are a smart girl. RB: And I do my cooking and everything. AK: Isn’t that wonderful. RB: But I have a wonderful nephew in San Francisco. He's a policeman, and he comes up and checks my cupboard and whatever he thinks is missing, the next time he comes he brings it to me. CE: Very good. RB: He's a wonderful fellow, and his name is Frank Watson and he's in San Francisco. CE: Now would you tell me a little bit about your family? I know there was your father, Pablo, and an uncle, Jose, and you had an Aunt Maria and then there were two other daughters of Gregorio? RB: Yes, there was Mrs. Knott and Mrs. McGovern. CE: Do any members of the family live in this area, other than you, Rose? RB: Well, there is only one more person and that's Sherman Smith. He's my cousin. He lives up on the mesa. AK: Yes. I didn't know he was related to you. RB: Yes, cousins. CE: Is this true, Rose, that your grandfather was born in 1791 and that he had been the son of Marcus Briones who had accompanied Father Serra to Yerba Buena in 1776? Your great grandfather? RB: I guess it's right because -- I didn't know very much about this history, but I used to hear my father talk about it. I have my father's picture at the very end there. AK: Yes, we'll see it before we go. RB: He's with my sister Belle. CE: Well now, when your grandfather settled here, he married into the Garcia family, I understand. Your grandfather married into the Garcia family. Ramona Garcia, that would be your maternal grandmother. RB: Ramona Garcia, that would be my grandmother. CE: Your maternal grandmother, yes. Did you ever meet her? RB: Oh, yes. CE: What was she like? RB: She was just a little old lady and you ought to see her dance, it was wonderful. She was so tiny, much shorter than I am, and she would pickup her petticoats and dance around the jig, Spanish jig, so she said. CE: Well, I understand your parents were married at Mission Dolores in 1882. RB: I imagine so. AK: My goodness. CE: This is all from the history books. Do you remember your grandfather, Gregorio, at all? RB: No. CE: But you remembered your grandmother more? RB: I remember my grandmother, yes. CE: I understand that they had met in Monterey, years ago. RB: I guess that's correct.  CE: Now, the first house that your grandfather built was sort of a palisade. Is that how you pronounce it? Where was that first house? In Bolinas, wasn't it? RB: It was just across from the Catholic Church. CE: And some of it still is there, is it not? RB: Yes, if the hippies haven't torn it to pieces. AK: No, I don't think they did, but somebody remodeled it and they didn't -- RB: I think Millers did. AK: They didn't keep the same nice line that it had first. RB: No. But that’s it. CE: How long have you lived in this little house, might I ask? RB: Well, it's quite a few years because I lived in the city. You know, I went from one of my sister’s to the other one, they were sick. CE: And took care of them. RB: Or their husbands were sick. I'd go so that my sister could devote her time to her husband and I'd go and do the housework and do the shopping and do anything for them. AK: In San Francisco? RB: In San Francisco, yes. And then of course I'm the last one now, they're all passed away. CE: You're the last of the Briones? RB: Yes, I'm 94 and I do all my work here. AK: That is great. CE: Now this is where your property is now. RB: Yes, this is -- CE: How much land do you have around you now? An acre maybe? RB: It might be, because all in the front and there's quite a bit of property in the back of this house. AK: Yes, couple of acres, I would think. CE: Did your family talk much about the way things used to be? RB: I don't think so, because I was always playing outside and I didn't listen to them. AK: I wonder when the Owl began to run. Do you know? RB: The Owl? Well I think that the Peetars boys had the Owl. CE: Yes. RB: And my brother, Albert, was the engineer. AK: I see. But I was wondering about those older people long ago in San Francisco. Did they have to come by stage and horseback to come to Bolinas? How did they come? RB: They must have come from Sausalito. CE: Over the mountain by stage. AK: Well, long before there was a train, I mean. RB: Well, we never had a train into Bolinas. AK: No, I know that. But I read where so many people come on horseback, so many of these young, like your grandmother, could have done that. CE: Do you remember your first visit to San Francisco? Were you a young woman? RB: I must have been a youngster. I can't remember nothing about that.  CE: No. Well I understand, around here in your grandfather's time there was at one time six lumber mills going. That this was magnificent stands of lumber and it was used, after the discovery of gold, to build San Francisco. RB: Yes, that's true, I heard about that, yes CE: As a youngster, there’s no -- It wasn't continuing then, but they used to have the ox carts, the oxen pulling the timber down to Bolinas Lagoon, and then they put it on lighters to deliver it out to the ships. Do you remember any of the vessels, the sailing vessels, that came to Bolinas? RB: I remember one was the Owl and the Schooner and the Ida A. CE: Jenny Griffith? RB: Maybe so. There was three. AK: Maybe that was long ago. CE: Do you remember the Flagstaff Inn, Rose? RB: Yes. CE: What was that like? RB: And it fell into the bay at the earthquake. CE It really did? RB: Yes. I think Mr. Parkin ran that. RB: Mr. Parkin ran that hotel there and it went into the bay at the time of the earthquake. AK That's right, yes, they have a big picture of the Canyon Ranch. Now the people who lived at Canyon Ranch, did you know them? RB: Canyon Ranch. AK: What is it called?- RB: That's on the Sausalito road. AK: Well, it's the top of the bay, you know, it's just at the head of the bay and that's where the Audubon birds are now. CE: Do you mean when the Menzies had that -- AK The Menzies bought it later, after -- CE: But the Bourne's had it, Peter Bourne. AK: Bourne house, the Bourne Ranch. Did you know them? RB: The Bourne people, yes. CE: What do you remember about them, what can you tell us? RB: Mrs. Bourne was my mother's cousin. CE: Oh, you were related. I didn’t know. RB: Yes. AK: I didn't know that. The house is very nice. It's still there, you know. CE: How would you get around this territory as a young girl, by horseback or carriage?Did youride? RB: By buggy or you could ride horseback if you wanted to, we had a buggy. CE: You had a buggy. AK: I guess everybody did then. RB: Sure. CE: Who were some of your neighbors that you were fond of? I know some perhaps more than others. Were there some neighbors, fellow ranchers, that -- Do you remember Charlie Lauff?  RB: Yes, Charlie Lauff was my uncle. CE: He was your uncle and he married Maria, not the first time. I think she married somebody else first? RB: Sebrean. CE: Sebrean. And then what happened? When he died she accepted Charlie? RB: Yes, that was it. AK: He lived a good long time too. RB: Oh, yes, Charlie Lauff lived a long time. The only time I would see him would be at church. AK: Where was the church that you went to? Right there near your house, some place? RB: Across from that old house, yes, and it still stands now. AK: Yes, still standing. RB: My father had it rebuilt. CE: Tell us about your father, Rose. Describe him for us. Tell us about him, his temperament. RB: Well, he was a very good man, as far as I know, and he was very kind and every day he -- When I was going to school he would come down and bring my bonnet and my shawl so that I could get in the buggy and ride to Bolinas with him. AK: That was nice. RB: Yes, it was nice for me then because I was just a young kid going to school. AK: And what was in Bolinas when you got there? Were there stores? RB: Yes, there was a store, the Gibson store. CE: Was running. RB: At that time. Then Joe Peetars had it next, and well, there was quite a few -- AK: What was the Gibson House? You know they make big stuff of the Gibson House now, beautiful place to go for dinner now, but was it an old place, the Gibson House? They talk about it as if it were old. RB: Well it's old, it's older than I am, I know. CE: Well, when your father took you by buggy, that was from your original home up there. RB: Up here. It's where the two-gable roof house stands up there by the creek. CE: Oh, up here in Woodville now? RB: In Woodville, yes. CE: I see, so that's where he would drive you with the buggy to school. RB: He would drive me down this way. This is where the old school house was and he would drive down and land there with my jacket and bonnet, because in those days we all wore bonnets. CE: And the school house was where? Right here? RB: No, they brought the school house from the McMullen place over the hill. They brought this building. CE: Was this building the school house? RB: This building was the school house. CE: Oh, so you -- Well of course! RB: And now I own the school house, now I live in the school house. CE: So you've got it made, Rose! When you look at it now Mrs. Kent, it's rectangular. RB: I'm the only teacher here.  AK: Isn't that nice. Well now I wonder if it's made of redwood. I wonder -- CE: Probably is. I wonder when it was built. Any idea, Rose? RB: It was built long time before I was born, I'm afraid. CE: Before you were born. RB: And I'm over 94 years old. AK: Yes, we'll find that out from your friends, the school men. You know the two fellows, McDonald and whatever his name is? The two men who had to do with the schools, they will have the date of this school house. RB: If they're alive. AK: Yes, they are. CE: Well, they're researching that project, so -- AK: Yes, they're writing all kinds of things about the Marin schools. CE: Tell me Rose, when you were growing up, was there any evidence of the lumber business around here when you were a youngster, or was it mostly ranching? What was going on? RB: There was that lumber business going by. CE: There was? RB: Yes, and all these big places were big ranches and cows, you know, and things like that. CE: Was your father at home most of the time? RB: No, because partly he used to be lassoing cow for the butcher or he'd be visiting somebody. He was the only doctor around. CE: Now tell us about that. That's right, Pablo treated people and he was supposed to be excellent in setting legs and broken bones and putting on splints. How did that come about? RB: I really don't know. He done it, and that's all I know. CE: So he was on call. He was on call when somebody was in trouble and he'd get in the buggy and go? RB: Either that or horseback. AK: Did you ever go with him? RB: No. CE: How far would he go sometimes, up to Olema? RB: Point Reyes and San Rafael and down here at Stinson Beach. He went all over. CE: You must have been proud of him. RB: Well, I was only a youngster when he was doing these things and it didn't mean anything to me. AK: How long did he live? RB: Father was 75 when he died. AK: That's wonderful, to be the doctor to take care of people in such a wide area. CE: Rose did you have any brothers and sisters? RB: Oh yes, they're all passed away. CE: Would you give me their names, please? RB: Picture of Jack is right there, the last one. CE: Jack. Alright.  RB: Well, his name was John, but we called him Jack all the time. And here is Belle, she became a nurse in a hospital. CE: Belle. RB: And then there was Dottie and she married Ed Fowler. And Inez was -- She married Walsh and the other sisters never married, I never married. CE: What was the other sister? RB: There was Fanny and there was -- Can't think -- CE: And just the one brother, Rose, you had just one brother, John? RB: My oldest brother was Paul and then Jack and there was Frank and Albert. CE: Gee, big family! RB: I think altogether there were 12 children. AK: Imagine that. CE: Wonderful. Were you all born at home? RB: I think so. We weren't born in no hospital, because in those days there weren't any hospitals. AK: That’s right. CE: Did your mother live as long as your father? RB: No, he died first. Father died first and then Mother. CE: I imagine she was a wonderful homemaker. RB: She was, yes. And she made all our clothes and no sewing machine, by hand. AK: Oh, think of it. CE: Now, where would she go to shop sometimes? Would she go to San Rafael to get fabric, or what would she do? Would she take the schooner over to the city? Do you have any remembrances of that? RB: If she got the material, maybe it was my father that went on the schooner to San Francisco and he done the buying and she done the sewing. CE: Was she always involved in preserving fruit and -- RB: Yes, done all the canning. AK: And all the girls learned to do that too, then? RB: Yes. CE: Well then you lived here most of your life until you went to help your sisters, when they were sick, didn't you Rose? Didn’t you -- What year would that be when you went away? In the 30s, 40s, World War II time or -- RB: Can't remember. CE: Were any of your brothers have to go to war? RB: Maybe Albert did, I don't know, the youngest one. CE: How would you amuse yourself, if you had any leisure time? Did you like to go out on the countryside around you, by horseback? RB: No, if there was any amusement there would be a dance you'd go to. CE: Where would you go? RB: DruidsHall. CE: Down here at Olema? Oh, there's one in -- RB: There's one in Bolinas, as you're going into Bolinas the old Hall still stands there. CE: You like to dance too, like your mother did? RB: Yes. We all knew how to dance, all of us. CE: What would you dance, the waltz?  RB: Yes, and polka, square dance. CE: Square dance. Did they have live entertainment, live music? RB: The accordion and I think the banjo. CE: Now could you go to those dances ninety years ago without an escort? Who would take you, your brother, a date, or how did they work that out? Did you have a chaperone? RB: That I don't remember. We went out a bunch of us together. And then some of my cousins over here from San Rafael and then the whole bunch would go. Nobody in particular, just a bunch of us. CE: Do you remember when the trains were running from out here all the way up to past Point Reyes Station and all the way up the Russian River? Do you remember your first train ride? Say, either up country or in to San Rafael, Rose? RB: In San Francisco I went on -- Oh, I can't even remember. I went, I know, on one. I think it was Sausalito and from Sausalito of course you go the ferry boat onto the city. But that's such a long time ago. AK: That would be in '72. The railroad came in '72. RB: Well they ran after that. She wasn't born then. CE: Do you remember any bad winters or storms? RB: No, I don't. AK: Shipwrecks? RB: Uh -- CE: Or unusual happenings that brought all hands out. A shipwreck, Rose? RB: Well I don't remember what year it was, but -- CE: Well that's alright. RB: But people were taken off of I think Pebble Beach, I think. AK: You mean the Coast Guard took them? CE: The farmers, the ranchers, I bet. RB: The ranchers took care of them here and then they were, in some way they took them back to the city, but that boat went to pieces there on -- CE: On the rocks, right out there. RB: Yes. CE: Well now, let's get back to your school days for a minute, Rose. Do you remember any of your teachers? Or did you have one teacher for everything? RB: There was one teacher for all the school, yes. My teacher was Richard Carter. CE: Richard Carter. RB: And from here he went to Sausalito and he was there. My sister met him and he wasn't teaching he was just working for -- I don't know what you'd say he was working at. CE: Do you remember some of the subjects that interested you the most? Did you like history, English, what? RB: I liked history better than anything else. AK: Good. And here you are making history. CE: History your favorite subject, and we're in the school house. Did you study California history, Rose? RB: I guess general history that we had. CE: General history.  RB: Not just California. CE: General history of the United States and the world. RB: Yes. CE: Where did you sit? RB: I sat over there. CE: Mid way on the right side coming in the main door, midway down. RB: Well I'd been so sick, you know, they moved my bed out here and I have everything right handy. Because I've been very sick. My niece came to visit me, and she found me laying on the floor, and then they had to call the doctor and put me in bed. So they moved all the furniture close, so I would be able to get up I wouldn't have to walk very far and that's why the house looks the way it does. AK: That’s good. CE: It's for your convenience. AK: That's good, that's the way it should be. CE: When you went to school, Rose -- RB: And I have heart trouble. CE: Do you? RB: Yes. the doctor tells me to be very careful and not to get excited and this sort, but I try not to. CE: Well, we won't tire you, we won't stay too long. Did you come to school about eight in the morning and stay, and bring your lunch, or did you go home? RB: No, I went home for lunch. And I walked to school and I found every mud hole in the road and I stepped in all of them. Then they asked me, “How did you get your feet so wet?” Well, I said, “I couldn't help it. There it was in the road and I had to walk on it.” CE: Do you remember any of the names of your classmates, Rose? RB: Ellen Bourne is one and Mary McCarty was the other one and Helen Wilkins. CE: Certainly, those are old families. RB: And that's the Wilkin's Ranch there. CE: Rightacross. RB: Right across from here is the Wilkins Ranch. CE: Do you know Marin Pepper's mother, Mrs. Waterhouse? RB: Yes. CE What do you remember of her? RB: Well, I didn't visit her very much but I always met her when we were going to the city on the -- AK: Ferry. RB: No, no ferry -- stage. CE: On the stage? RB: Horse stage. CE: And what – RB: And then we'd go on the ferry boat and she'd insist that we go downstairs and have cup of tea, so we'd go downstairs. AK: She was a lovely woman. RB: And a piece of cake and by the time we were through, why we we'd be docking in San Francisco.  AK: That’s nice. CE: Albert was an engineer? RB: Yes, and he was on these big boats that rode across to China and everywhere. CE: Oh, so he was away a lot. RB: He was away a lot. And he was just like a father, very kind to everybody and full of the old nick. Well, my father was like that. You see his picture there? He looks as sober as a judge but -- I remember one time -- They used to serenade my mother for her birthday and this particular time my mother wasn't home. I think she was with my older sister and my older sister was married and she had a baby and my mother was over there. So he came and they were dancing. And you know, years ago the women all wore bustles and the string of her bustle fell and my father, when he came around, he gave it a kick and sent it clear across the room. And my father was full of fun. To look at him you think -- CE: Very serious. RB: But he was full of the old nick. CE: Well he certainly was very beloved in this area with his ability as a doctor, too. There's a bird knocked a little piece of wood off the perch. RB: He's mischievous, he's always by my bed. CE: I think it's wonderful you let this little parakeet fly freely. RB: Well, I wouldn't keep him in the cage all the time. I think it's cruel. He goes in when he wants to and he gets up in the morning when he wants to. CE: Say, I like your Franklin stove you have here, Rose. Do you fire that up often if it's cold? RB: Yes, once in a while but -- AK: You know, I never saw the little screen made exactly right for it. I think that's beautiful. CE: Well you can fire that up and warm your tea kettle on it. AK: Oh, you know those stoves are so much wanted. People go for miles and miles and hunt for those stoves all over the country. RB: For heavens sakes, it's a good old stove. CE: Tell me, Rose, did you ever -- Were you ever interested in, as a child, in flowers, wild flowers, or wild life? Did you have any little pets from nature? Do you remember? RB: I think I had all kind of pets but I didn't specifically care for one, like these calves when they were little, to feed them, you know. And you know you'd put your hand down in the milk and they'd suck your finger and they thought they were sucking the cow. Do you remember that? AK: I know that too. RB: Well you see, I have a partner. AK: She didn't know much, she had never been on a farm. She was really so excited to go on a farm and learn all the things because she was a city girl. RB: Yeah, city girls never learn anything like that. CE: No, they miss a lot, don't they Rose? RS: They do, don’t they? CE: Did you have to go out in the morning and help with the milking? RB: Sometimes I did.  CE: Sometimes. RB: Because my brothers were there then, but -- CE: Did you have some fowl around? Did you have chickens and -- RB: Chickens and turkeys, and geese and ducks. So my mother felt like having a chicken, she'd kill it, she felt like eating turkey, she'd kill that. And we had all kind of -- You've seen the guinea hens, haven't you? AK: Yes. RB: They are the noisiest chickens you've ever seen in your life. You haven't seen them? CE: No. AK: They say they are good watch dogs. RB: Yes, and especially when they see the hawk around. They screech and the chickens will fly under the place to cover themselves to get away from the hawk. End, Side A CE: Talk about your school days a little more. I guess this Richard Carter really impressed you. Was he a young man? RB: Yes, very nice teacher. He was very nice to all of us. CE: How many would you be in your class, a dozen? RB: I don’t know. You know, out in the country like this you don’t get big bunches in your class. CE: But maybe twelve? You might have twelve? ten? RB: Maybe six. CE: Six! RB: Yes, because there aren’t so many people in the surrounding country yet as there is now. CE: You took mathematics? You had arithmetic, history, English, what else? RB: I had to learn to talk English because I’m Spanish. CE: Now you spoke Spanish in the home, I presume, Rose, all the time? RB: Yes, with my mother. My mother never learned to talk English. CE: Will you pronounce the name of the rancho correctly for us? RB: Which rancho? CE: That was your family’s. RB: The Briones Rancho? CE: Yes. No, the Bolinas, the Rancho Baulines. How do you say Baulines? RB: Yes. CE: Is that correct? RB: Yes. Baulines. CE: How do you say Point Reyes Peninsula? RB: The same as you say it yourself. CE: Well, that’s sort of the English, Point Reyes, I thought they said. RB: Yes. CE: But you did speak Spanish in the home with your mother? RB: Yes. CE: And other subjects they had in school? Did you go to the blackboard a lot?  RB: Yes, went and had to stand in the corner lots of times because I didn't know my lessons. CE: Did you really? RB: Yeah, and that's the corner I stood in. CE: Right over there? AK: That’s cute. RB: Yes, because this is the old building that we had. CE: But generally you enjoyed school, didn't you, Rose? RB: Yeah, but I played a lot. CE: What did you do when you played? With your pals you'd hike over the hills? RB: I'd throw spit balls all around the school house. CE: Oh, you were charming. RB: Charming? Nobody else said that about me. CE: “Rose, Queen of the Spit Balls.” RB: Oh sure, I was a regular tomboy. Done everything anybody else could do. CE: Did you help around the property? Did you ever help shoe a horse? RB: No, I didn't do that. I drove a horse. CE: You drove a horse? RB: And I rode a horse but I didn't shoe them. CE: Did you have your own horse for a time in your life? Did you have your own little mare or saddle horse? RB: No, all the children could use it, the same horse at one time, you know, we shared it with each other. CE: Do you remember the name of any of your horses? RB: Just one mare, we called her Tooney. CE: Tooney? RB: Yes. And you know, she had a blue eye and a brown eye. Did you ever see an animal like that before? CE: No. RB: No - this was - she was a wonderful saddle horse but she would shy at everything. You had to be very careful when you were riding her or driving her because she would shy so much, but she was a nice horse. CE: Did you ever take the horse and get beyond where you hoped to be. I mean did you ever take a long ride and then darkness come upon you and you'd think, “Oh my goodness I'd better get home?” RB: No, I trusted the horse, the horse would bring me home safe. I came over the mountain one night dark, my sister was living over there and her husband, he was a game keeper for the Tamalpais place. And I didn't have to drive her. I let the lines loose and she walked down the hill and all those turns, she made all the turns, got into Bolinas and then she took me right to where I was working for Mrs. Gilfellen. Then she went up there and we went to the barn and I told the boy that I couldn't walk up there, for him to come with us and he would bring the horse back and the buggy, and so he did, and there's a winding road facing the ocean and all up where we went. CE: She knew how to get home. RB: He brought her home. I went to the stable and had this boy go with us.  AK: Yes, that was good. Miss Gilfellen was on a high hill. RB: Yes, that’s right. Those were the good old days. We used to go wading in the ocean there, right handy to come up and down from the house and go down that bank. There's steps all the way down to the beach, and then we'd go wading. AK That's where they do the surfing now, all those crazy kids, exactly the same place. CE: You went to the school here until you got tired of it or until you got to the eighth grade and then you finished? RB: I had to quit because my mother took sick and I was the only one at home. The rest of the girls were in the city and had their jobs and I had to quit and take care of her. CE: Looks like you've done that all your life, take care of members of your family, Rose. RB: And then she fell and broke her leg so that made it that much longer for me to take care of her, so I never went back to school. I didn't even graduate out of grammar school. CE: Well you learned to read. Do you enjoy reading? RB: Very much, and that's how I get those Reader's Digest, I like those books. CE: Well we have to bring you some. Do you like to read Geographic? RB: Yea, but I like the others better. CE: You like the others. There was a stage that went from Bolinas to Sausalito, I think, wasn't there? RB: Yeah. CE: And you'd get it at Bolinas and you'd go right over Tam, right over the mountain? RB: At one time, yes they went over the mountain, but then after a while they changed the route and they went Sausalito way. CE: On Sausalito way, too? AK: You mean around the coast? RB: Yes. CE: Oh, that must have been a scary run. RB: No, it was lovely because we could see the ocean back here and the sun would be going down and then you'd see it and everything. It was a beautiful ride. I have a very dear friend who several times I've gone over to the city with her, Betty Longland. I don't think you know her. And that's the road she loves to drive over and she took me over to the city. I had to go and help my sister because her husband was very sick, you know, and I had to go over and help her out, you know do errands and help her to cook. CE: Yes, do all the things you have to do. RB: Yes. So, and then going that way you see the sun going down. It's beautiful going over the mountain like that. AK: It's the most beautiful, but it's the scariest, though. RB: Well nothing like that scared me. CE: No, it was nature which was beautiful. RB: You know when you live in the country you get used to everything. CE: Tell me, Rose, have you ever seen a dry year like this winter and this last year? Have you seen it as bad in your lifetime? RB: No. I don't ever remember it being this bad.  CE: Do you have a well or a spring out here, Rose? How do you get your water? RB: Well that's just because Mr. what do you call him, is going to come up today or this evening. I was over at Bolinas with a friend of mine and she went back to Calaveras County and she told the situation here and he wanted to bring some big drums to fill them up with water for me so I wouldn't have to carry water any distance. CE: Where have you being carrying water from? RB: From the creek. CE: From the creek? RB: Yes. CE: I notice you have a 30 gallon plastic barrel in your kitchen, full of water. RB: Yes. CE: Could I get some water for you before we go? RB: Oh no, they'll do it. And then this -- He's a Mayor of Bolinas. His name is Santos, I think, and he brought this water that's here now. AK: That jug right there, is that water? RB: Yes, and this one right here and that one out there. So he said he'd see that I have water all the time. CE: That's good. RB: I didn't ask for it, he offered. AK: That's nice. RB: And this friend of mine, she's in Calaveras, she went back and she told them about it and that's how I'm getting the water. CE: Tell me Rose, do you have any family keepsakes of your father's or grandfather's? Like do you have a family Bible in your possession? RB: There's a family Bible there on the table, but how many things I got in it I don't know. CE: May I look at it? RB: Sure. CE: Rose's family Bible here and it is the Catholic Action Edition and there are some photographs gathered throughout and perhaps we can ask Rose about some of this. Now, here is a young man named George Heckmeyer. Did he become a priest? RB: Yes, and he's passed away, too. CE: Did he live around here? RB: Yes, yes, and one of his sisters is living in San Francisco, Jane Heckmeyer. I hear from her all the time. CE: And here is an obituary for Frank Briones. RB: Yes, that's my brother. CE: Your brother. He died in 1960. May I read from this? RB: You can, help yourself, my darling, help yourself. CE: "Funeral services will be held Thursday for Frank Briones who lived all of his 82 years in Bolinas. He was found dead yesterday of natural causes. He was a descendent of the family which settled in the Baulines Rancho in 1837 under a grant from the Mexican government. In his youth he had worked, from time to time, in the timber country in the northern part of the state, but maintained his  residence in Bolinas. For many years he was a gamekeeper for the Point Reyes Sportsman Club." RB: So was my brother Jack at the same time. CE: Have you ever been over to that club? Have you ever seen that club? RB: Oh, I haven't been there in a long time. I did go up to see Jack several times. CE" "But, since 1920, Frank has devoted his time to ranching and to his hobby of raising and experimenting with fruit trees." RB: That's true, and he’d graft the trees and they'd grow beautifully for him. CE: "He was last seen on Saturday when he stopped at the home of his sister Rose Briones for a cup of tea.” RB: That's wrong. He went to my sister Inez when he had the cup of tea. I wasn't there. But that's the only mistake that's there. CE: "He is survived by three sisters, Rose Briones of Bolinas, Mrs. Inez Walsh and Mrs. Belle Lotter of San Francisco." This is a beautiful Bible. Is this Frank again? RB: That's Frank. That's him, in his garden with all his beautiful flowers, He had a hobby of raising the prettiest -- CE: Beautiful! AK: Did anybody carry on -- Did he have children to go on doing it? RB: Well, Frank never married, you know. My brothers never married but my sisters did. CE: Here's another photograph of your sisters, I presume. RB: This is my sister Inez in the middle and that's her daughter Eileen, who's a teacher in Berkeley and this is Ruth, the youngest daughter. CE: Very nice. Can I see that, Mrs. Kent? Are you able to go out to go to church? RB: Yes, I go to church on Sundays, yes. CE: Who picks you up? RB: Molly and her husband. They come with a car right to the gate here and then she comes in and helps me get my coat on and helps me out and I get to go to church. CE: Who's Molly? RB: MollyTexeria. CE: Oh, Molly. RB: But she's married, you see, to Tim. CE: Is that Irene's name or -- RB: Irene is her sister CE: Oh, her sister. RB: You know Irene? CE: Yes, we had the pleasure of meeting her at the Boyd Stewart’s. Who is the lady with her? RB: That's my sister Belle in San Francisco. She was making -- You know they had this fair for little children little children and she made these dolls that she's holding there. You know, years ago they used to make dolls out of anything, old rags, you know, and that's all I had when I was growing up, these rag dolls. CE: Surely. AK: They were nice too. Now the people are doing it, they think they found something new. RB: Yes, and they are just repeating what we did years ago.  CE: You have this beautiful table. Is this part of the family? RB: All that belonged to my mother. CE: And this is a most unusual tablecloth you have here. RB: Yes, my nephew, he -- I was washing a white tablecloth all the time. “Oh,” he said, “Aunt Rose, you're not going to wash anymore this tablecloth,” so he buys me this thing, so I don't have to wash the tablecloth. CE: And where was this made? RB: Well he bought it in San Rafael somewhere. Glen Walsh is the one that gave it to me. AK: But the table is made in San Quentin. CE: The table was? RB: Yes, I think it was made in San Quentin and had a third leg in the middle. AK: Leafs. CE: Do you have a photo album in your possession, Rose? RB: Isn't there one there? CE: I better say goodbye for today. I certainly thank you for sharing with us some of the reminiscences of your family. RB: It's alright, but why don't you stay longer? CE: We don't want to tire you and we want to get our guest going, but it's really been a privilege to meet you. RB: Well, I've been happy to see you. CE: And you've been so cordial and hospitable to Mrs. Kent and me. We will come back soon. RB: I didn't know that's Mrs. Kent. CE: Yes, that's Mrs. Kent. RB: Well, what do you know. I never thought I'd ever meet her. AK: Well, there were a lot of kids, an awful lot of kids, you know. RB: Yes. CE: This lady is the prize of the family. She's the one that's interested in history and got me started in this project. RB: Oh well, that's a good project and I'm glad that you're here.
MarinCounty;Elizabeth Boyd;CE: Today is Monday, July 26, 1976. Continuing the Oral History Program of the California Room at the Marin County Library at Civic Center, this is Carla Ehat. And today we are at the residence of Mrs. Thomas Kent, at 131 Goodhill Road in Kentfield. And shortly we will have the pleasure of interviewing Mrs. Elizabeth Boyd, 77 Brentwood Drive, San Rafael. Now, the interesting thing about Elizabeth is that her family have been in Marin since the 1860s. Is that correct, Betty? EB: The late 1860’s, I guess. My father was born here in 1872 and I think that his father came, as I understand, from Madison, Wisconsin, sometime in the ’60s. Was here for a bit and then went back and brought back his bride. CE: I see. Well, now, what brought your family initially to Marin? Did you ever hear the story? I see you’ve brought with you today some interesting artifacts. One of them is a fascinating journal written by a twelve year old boy, your grandfather, when he crossed by immigrant train from St. Louis to Placerville in 1852. This is an extraordinary document, Betty, and we’ll discuss that as we go along. And you also have with you a scrapbook of your father, a collection of newsprint and some old photographs. Well, tell us what happened. Can you start from the beginning? EB: Well, I never knew too much about my father’s side of the family. My Grandfather Boyd was apparently sort of a carpenter or contractor combination. CE: Well, the grandfather that came across the plains, his name was – EB: Verdenal.           CE: John Verdenal. EB: Right. This is my paternal grandfather. And he built the only building left in San Rafael, St. Paul’s Church, which – He was one of the main people who built that. I think that he did the old B Street School, which was torn down, and other buildings. But he dropped dead on Fourth Street when he was about 40 years old. My father had one other brother, William, and three sisters. I think the family was left pretty much on their uppers. My father finished grammar school, then he went to commercial high school for two years, and – CE: Where was he born? EB: In San Rafael. CE: Where abouts? EB: I’m not sure. There was a house on Mission Street right across from the McCarthy place. I believe it’s torn down now. There’s one standing, very similar and I’m not sure whether he was born there or not. Someone once – I think Emma Martinelli told me he had been born in that house, but you know, it’s one of those things that you really don’t know for sure. CE: Well, that’s almost like an affidavit. EB: Yes. And so where he grew up, I don’t know, but he went to commercial high school and he finished there, and apparently he was offered some kind of a job in an accountant’s office and he didn’t want it. He hired out as a carpenter, worked as a carpenter for two years, and studied law at night, and when he was 16 he got a job in the County, here, as a court reporter. He passed the bar examinations before he was 21. Well, the bar examinations then weren’t what they are today. Then he commenced practice here in the county. From there, he became City Attorney. Then he was District Attorney for a number of years, and he was also President of the Board of Education for sixteen years. And after the present high school in San Rafael was built, he did not run again. There was a great ruckus about that, because it was considered to be so far out of San Rafael, a good many of the people didn’t want it. A great many of the people were against my father when he’d run for the Board of Education, because all of his children were in private school. I and my sisters went to Dominican, and Tommy went to the Tamalpais School for Boys. But I think that was mainly because the type of community at that time had so many Portuguese children, Italian children, and I suppose he felt the connections were better, and also he aimed to improve the schools. CE: That was his aim, to improve the schools. EB: He didn’t have an education, he believed in an education. The whole time he was an attorney, almost up to the time of his death, he took University Extension courses, in various things, Italian. CE: Describe your father for us. EB: Well, he was a very warm man, a very generous man, and I know that the community thought a great deal of him because they closed the schools for half a day when he died. CE: What year did he die? EB: In 1933, January 1933. CE: There’s a photograph here you’ve brought, Betty, and it’s some occasion.  EB: Well, that was the most important occasion of my life. I was riding in a parade on Fourth Street. CE: How old could you have been then? EB: I think about six. CE: Six maybe. EB: I think so. CE: You’re all dressed up with a – EB: White middy skirt. CE: Middy skirt. EB: Corded in red. CE: And a big hair bow. EB: This was taken on Third Street, and I think it was probably between A and Lindaro, I’m not too sure. I rather remember those funny little houses there. I begged and begged for him to take me in the parade, mainly because I wanted to ride a horse. CE: Was he an avid horseman? EB: Yes, he kept a horse at home. This was not his horse. This is his horse in the other picture, a little thoroughbred mare. And I didn’t tell any of my friends, and I think the proudest moment of my life was on the corner of Fourth and B when they were all there for the parade, and I waved to them. CE: That was your moment. EB: Right. So, my father died in ’33, and I know that mother wasn’t well, and I was at the funeral parlor, and the doctor said that he had to be there because he was a prominent man, and people would be coming to the house, etc. And I never saw so many people that I’d never met before in my life who were crying. And among his papers we found any number of things where he’d lent a hundred dollars here, and so forth and so on. He died at the age of 60 which was rather young. CE: District Attorney for how many years? EB: It was 12 years, I think. I’m not too sure about that. I believe it’s in that scrapbook there. I don’t remember whether it was 1906 or 1902. CE: How was he in sharing his time with his children? Did he teach you how to ride? EB: Oh, yes, yes. And he used to take us every place. I was the eldest, so I took the place of the first son, and that was when I had my first overnight train ride. He had a case in Los Angeles. CE: And he took you with him? How old were you then? EB: He took me with him. Let’s see, that was probably about 1916 or 1917. I was born in 1903. It was very exciting because we came home by boat. CE: By boat. You go on the Yale or Harvard? EB: No, it was a swamp boat. I forgot the name of it. It was sort of a tug boat. The war had tied up shipping quite a bit. And we were due in San Francisco at six that night, and we got in at nine or ten, and the boat had run out of food, and I think we had some soup, but for me it was very exciting. And while we were in Los Angeles we had dinner at the old Hotel Alexander, which I believe was one of the nice hotels then, and the waiter pointed out Charlie Chaplin to me. CE: Another thrill. EB: Another thrill.  CE: Well, he sounds like a wonderful dad. EB: Well, he was, he truly was. He took my brother camping, bought my brother a horse. CE: Was he strict? EB: No. Mother was the one who did all the directing. CE: She was the disciplinarian. EB: If one really did something naughty, my father would come and talk to you very quietly. Had much more effect on me than Mother scolding me every time. CE: Tell us the other members of your family now. You had your brother. EB: Well, I’m the eldest. CE: You’re the eldest and you have a sister. EB: I have a sister, Frances, who is married and lives in San Francisco who has – CE: What is her name now? EB: MacDonald. CE: MacDonald. EB: And her eldest daughter is Dolly MacDonald, who married Ken MacDonald from Albany, New York, who is associated with my brother in his law firm. They have four boys and they live in Greenbrae. Her other child John, lives in Novato and he has two little girls and a little boy. CE: Then there’s your brother. EB: Then my sister Ruth. CE: Oh, another sister. EB: Ruth, who married Frank Nibley and she lives in San Francisco. She has two boys and a daughter. Her daughter lives in Kentfield, has three boys, one has just won the 14-year-old tennis tournament which the IJ and the Recreation Department put on, and then two other boys are twins, not identical. And Nan just finished serving on the Grand Jury. Ruth’s two boys live in the Islands. One is Vice President for the First, it used to be Bishop Bank, but it’s the First Hawaiian now. And the other is with one of Bechtel’s insurance companies, and the eldest boy has two boys and Tommy has two little adopted girls. So the family is still very much in evidence. CE: And you didn’t tell us about your brother. EB: Oh, Tom. CE: Is he the baby? EB: Yes, Tom is the baby. Tom is a bachelor, the youngest. CE: Have you been close? EB: We live together. CE: Pretty close. Tell us about Tom. EB: When Tom was about 11 he had a slight case of rheumatic fever, and the doctor said he was never to engage in competitive sports, so my father got him a horse, and then he got him a small sailboat. Tom went through the seventh grade, and my father intended to send him right through public schools, but Tommy apparently had the teachers all buffaloed because his father was President of the Board of Education. He was getting away with murder. So my father yanked him out and sent him to the Tamalpais School for Boys which was over on Grand Avenue at that time. He hated to go there because it was a “sissy school.”  Terrible fight he put up. But he graduated with honors and he went on to the University of California. He was an Alpha Delta Phi there and track manager. I said he couldn’t go in for sports and be active on the campus, and then he graduated from Boalt in the top third of his class and had offers from many of the good firms in San Francisco, but he preferred to come over here. And this was 1938-39 when the depression was still on. So Tom started out, and when the war came he even had his Draft Board changed, hoping that they’d miss the slight murmur, because he’s always been healthy and a bachelor, but he was not accepted. He did a great deal of work with the Sea Scouts, and I think he was head of them from all the way to Salt Lake City. And he lived at home, and he’s always had a boat. The boat is his wife, you know. It’s a 46 foot schooner. He’s been down to Mexico and around. Mother died in 1960. We both lived there, at home with her at the old house. They’re pictures there. CE: Where is the address of that old house? EB: 1579 Lincoln Avenue. CE: Because we like to get these addresses. EB: Papa built that in 1906. CE: 1906. EB: And all the stone wall was from the quarry on our property, part of the stone wall is still there. CE: How many acres did you have there? EB: Well, we had 25 originally. CE: Twenty-five. EB: It’s part of the Coleman Tract, and I think it was sold in parcels such as that. And my father bought there because we had all our own water. We had a spring on the place. And then I think probably not too long after they moved in in 1906 or 1907, whichever it was, part of the acreage was sold off which would be a little bit south of where the Kells are. The property which the Kells are on, we kept. There is over seven acres and there is a beautiful redwood grove, and that’s where the spring was up on the hill. And then Mother, I guess it was in the ‘40s after the war, sold that piece to Kent and Minto. But we still had about an acre and a half on which this house was located. CE: And you stayed on that until – EB: Right. And the Kells did not buy the property from us. They bought it from whoever had it at that time. CE: Yes. EB: And that’s when the other houses went up. CE: Well, now let’s get back to you, Betty. I can see you in this house from 1906 forward, until you sold it in ’68, was it? EB: ’68, yes. CE: Okay. Now your father and mother made the decision that you children were going to get a good education, and you went to Dominican. EB: That’s right. CE: Grammar school and high school? EB: Yes. CE: Were you there when Sister Patrick –  EB: Oh, yes, Sister Patrick was – CE: Was the President? EB: No, no. CE: But she was there? EB: She was a student in the college part. In those days, we could get a license to drive a car when we were fourteen. And I was allowed to drive a car, so I was very popular with the college girls. CE: You had your own wheels. EB: Well, I didn’t have my own wheels, but I had the car. CE: But you had a car. EB: And I came in very handy taking them down to Mrs. Stapp’s, and so forth and so on. CE: And what was Mrs. Stapp’s, for the record? Sounds like a sweet shop. EB: Oh, Mrs. Stapp’s was on Fourth street. CE: Do you know, Mrs. Kent, what she is talking about? AK: Yes. CE: Well, what is it? AK: A candy store. EB: It was a candy store, and all the convent girls used to go there, and Mrs. Stapp was a wonderful person. Actually where Le Petite Auberge is – CE: Yes. EB: Mrs. Stapp had a very great friend named Claude Barr, who was one of the Supervisors. Part of the Barr family here. And he built this little building, this little brick building, which is now Le Petite Auberge, and – AK: Do you know? CE: The French restaurant, yes. EB: And the day it was opened, Mrs. Hine and a number of other people gave a tea for Mrs. Stapp, because she had been so marvelous to all their children. When they wanted to know where Morgan was, or somebody else, they’d call up Mrs. Stapp. Did you know that, Mrs. Kent? AK: No, I didn’t. EB: And she had an orchid on her, and it was just marvelous. EB: And she has since died, and her father has since died. And Mrs. Stapp would occasionally get all dressed up, and she’d have a big fox fur collar on her coat, and Pop would have his Cadillac, and they’d go out for the evening. It was a lovely thing, it really truly was, and everyone loved her very much. I don’t mean loved her, but was very fond of her, and had a great deal of respect for her. CE: You’re not old enough to have remembered those baths down there. EB: Vaguely. CE: Vaguely. You knew where they were, you didn’t go there. EB: Oh, yes, right. I think I was there a couple of times. CE: Were you? EB: And it seems to me that we went there to see some swimming events. AK: Yes, they were there a long time. EB: Yes, I think maybe it was until 1920 or so before they burned down. AK: A little more.  CE: There’s some interesting stories that I’ve heard about you that I wonder if you could share with us. When you were very young you had a compassionate nature then, and I hear that you befriended a young man and fed him. A man who was a most unusual man. EB: Oh, that story. Well, he was unusual in the sense that he had escaped from San Quentin, and my father was District Attorney. CE: Well, how did this come about? How did this ever happen? EB: Well, the house next door on our right was empty. CE: Right from this house here. EB: Yes, where the William Murrays lived later on, you know, the bank people. I used to love detective stories, and I think I was quite a romanticist in a way. And I saw this man over there wandering around, and I don’t know whether I knew he had escaped. On the far side of the house there was an oriel window that was broken, so – CE: He didn’t have any sort of clothes on that would indicate – EB: None that I recollect. It was pretty hazy that I can remember, except that I remember going over there, and after school I would take some bread and jelly or an apple and put it on this oriel window, and then I’d look to see if it were gone. Charlotte Brown, who went to the convent with me, I remember, I took over there one day. And I never actually saw him, to speak to that I can remember. But I had some notepaper that somebody had given me, and it was from Shreve’s, and it had a red and white candy stripe line, and I guess I wrote him a note to see if he had enough to eat. Well, shortly after that, the man was picked up and taken down to County Jail, and my father was District Attorney at the time. My father came home and he said, “Do you have some note paper with red and white stripes on it?” and I said, “Yes.” I don’t ever remember his scolding me. I suppose he was so relieved there hadn’t been any untoward occurrence. CE: Yes. Well, that was perceptive of him to even ask. How did he know? EB: Well, he probably recognized my handwriting. CE: That’s a great story. EB: Sometimes I tell it because I think it’s very funny. CE: I think it’s wonderful. Did you have any pets when you were growing up? You had your horse? EB: Oh. No, I always wanted a horse. Mother grew up in San Francisco. She wasn’t a country girl. She was always rather afraid. My father did get me a horse once, and mother thought it was too frisky, and I was never allowed to keep one. So all I wanted for my birthday were riding tickets from the Youngren Stable. CE: Where was that? EB: That was on the corner of Third and Lincoln on the southwest corner. CE: What’s the name of it again? EB: It was Youngren, Y-o-u-n-g-r-e-n. They were Scandinavian, and they were martinets. They taught English riding. Later on, actually after I was out of college and my marriage had broken up and I was home again, the Youngrens occasionally in the spring would pasture some of their horses on our property in back, and Tom and I had the privilege of riding them. CE: Great, great.  EB: But I had a very active life. Mother Raymond, from the Convent, once said to me after I was a grown woman, she said, “I think I never knew a child who enjoyed life as much as you did.” CE: What were some of the things you did? EB: Well, the Hitchcock boys were wonderful. There were two military academies then when I was growing up, the Hitchcock Military Academy, which was very close to where we lived, and the Tamalpais. CE: Where was that Hitchcock? Can you – EB: Yes, it was at Grand Avenue where the Marist Academy was, and where the Marin Tennis Club is now. CE: Is that where the Hitchcock was? EB: Yes, it was that whole complex. CE: Okay, got it. EB: And dancing school was attended there. CE: Did you resist any of these things, or did – EB: Oh, no, no, I loved them. The Hitchcock dances and their football games and track meets were really big events. And, of course, the Hitchcock boys loved to be invited over to play tennis and have ice cream. CE: Sounds like a beautiful life. EB: But these dances – We were never unchaperoned. We were never allowed out of the place without a chaperone. Even when the dance itself was chaperoned by the – CE: You managed to have a good time, didn’t you? EB: Oh, yes. Mrs. Sharon and her husband owned it then, gave the boys a little room which was called a “cozy room.” For the big dance of the year they were allowed to decorate it, and there would always be one little corner that ferns would be put up. Or they’d get branches of trees, and maybe you might sit behind there for a minute with your beau, and he might hold your hand, and maybe get a quick kiss. It was really a great life. CE: Was life at Dominican, when you were there, strict? EB: Well, I was a day scholar. CE: Day scholar. EB: And it was strict, there’s no question about that. And I think there was – when I was a distress to the good sisters. CE: What made you choose to leave that climate and go over to the University of California? EB: Well, I really didn’t have anything to say about it. In those days, our parents planned things, and I think – And actually, Mother Raymond made it very difficult for me to graduate, because the college part had not been going too long, and she was trying to build up the college, and I’d done very well in school, but I had not passed my geometry. I took it from her and I think I was scared to death of her. And so, she wouldn’t give me a recommendation, so my father went to see her. I guess he persuaded her in some manner. He did all their legal work free, for example, and I know that she thought a great deal of him. So I went to Berkeley and I had to take geometry over again there, and I zipped right through and I  made all my grades, B average, so I wasn’t any disgrace to Dominican, you see. And my two sisters went to Berkeley, too. CE: What were your interests when you were going to the University of California? You were in Letters and Science? EB: Liberal arts. CE: Liberal arts. EB: Letters and Science. I was a history major and English minor. I was, believe it or not, Captain and Manager of the freshman crew. We rowed whaleboats on Lake Merritt. And our big race was against Mills College, and I was the starboard stroke, and the minute the race started, the port stroke broke her oar, so you can imagine where we ended up. And then, I think it isn’t still in existence, but I was a founding member of the Crop and Saddle Club. And I was on the Blue and Gold edition for my class, all the regular activities when you belong to a house in which you became involved. CE: Would you consider that experience one of your rich ones, that U.C. Berkeley? EB: Oh, yes, except, looking back, I think that I was never meant to live in a sorority house. I think in a sense I’m not a good person that way. But I enjoyed it. CE: Did you come home weekends? EB: Oh, yes, and it used to take about two hours then. CE: Tell us how you did that. EB: Well, we would ordinarily take the train to Sausalito, and then the ferry boat to San Francisco, and the ferry boat to Oakland, and then the Shattuck Avenue train. You change at Alcatraz, and you get off at College and Durant. Our house was on Durant. And on weekends we’d come home, and we’d bring our laundry, and – CE: And then you’d reverse the procedure on the weekend. EB: Yes. CE: That’s right, because the ferry, Berkeley to Richmond – EB: I think the Richmond Ferry had probably not started yet. CE: Hadn’t started. EB: We didn’t have cars anyway to go on. CE: No. EB: Incidentally, getting back to my father’s share in the Richmond Ferry, we had passes on the Golden Gate Ferry, and the Richmond Ferry, and the Sears Point toll road, because he did a great deal of work for Speas and Ashby Stewart, legal work, who had controlling interest then, and he was also a director of the Ridgecrest Boulevard – AK: Do you have those stock certificates? EB: I know we should have. CE: You might look through your stuff, if you have some. EB: I doubt it. CE: Well, Mrs. Kent saves all these things. EB: Well, I wish we had. AK: No, I didn’t save them all either. I used to have some of those passes, too. CE: Well, you have some wonderful things. EB: One thing I really didn’t get into my drawer – I did keep a few old things, but is a wonderful newspaper photograph, a photograph of Examiner and Chronicle, of a  CE: EB: CE: EB: AK: CE: EB: AK: EB: CE: AK: EB: CE: EB: Red Cross tea that was given at Mrs. Truxton Beale’s during the war. I also forgot to mention about my father, he was Mr. Republican from Sausalito to Eureka. Mr. Republican. Yes and he also ran the Liberty Bond drive during World War I, and was head of the Draft Board. Dedicated man. Yes. Working for the new Golden Gate Bridge. They had to make the nine counties all together. He worked for that. He worked in that effort. And you asked me about his taking me places. It just came to mind in mentioning this he would take me, and do you remember Margaret Foster? Oh, yes. This was for Liberty Bonds. Up to Inverness, to the old Yacht Club for a rally. I can remember being in the fire department here at Larkspur and all over the county. That’s great. We all seem to be mixed up on the number of different Boyd families there are. Could you explain? Well, as far as I know there were three Boyd families before the turn of the century in San Rafael. The George Boyd Family. And George Boyd married Margaret Kittle who lived here in Ross. The John Boyd family, he had two boys and a daughter. The two boys died at a very early age, and Boyd Park was given in their memory, Louise Boyd, who was a very famous person in her own right. Explorer? Explorer. And my father’s family, Thomas Boyd, his father was a contractor. My father became a lawyer. He had a brother, William, who owned the Sausalito News, and he was the Postmaster of Sausalito for many years. None of us were related, were always being confused. One time I was up in Bridgeport at a ranch, the Honeywell Ranch. I was introduced to a Mrs. Dunn from Pasadena. And the first thing she said to me, “Are you one of the Boyd’s from San Rafael?” and I said, “Yes, but not the social register Boyds.” Another time we were at a yacht club party, and a lady came up to me, and she had had a little too much. Tommy, my brother, was on one side of me, and Mickey Boyd, the grandson of George Boyd, was on the other side, and she was very insistent that she had read all about me, and seen my picture in the paper going to the opera, and my orchids. And I tried to explain to her that we were no relation. She was thinking of Louise Boyd. Mickey Boyd said, “Betty, we’re kissing cousins.” Tommy couldn’t take it any longer, and he said, “If you really want to know, Louise Boyd is our spinster grandmother!” That’s wonderful. Your grandfather was a builder? Yes. Did he build one of those older homes on E Street that Ambrose Bierce is supposed to have lived in? He – I don’t know whether he built those or not, but I was born in the house that Ambrose Bierce lived in. CE: EB: CE: EB:  CE: You were? EB: Yes. CE: Give us the address of that, Betty. EB: Oh, I’ve forgotten. It was 812 or 810 E. CE: E Street, right? EB: And we lived there up to the time my father finished the house on Lincoln Avenue. CE: I see. EB: Mother came there as a bride, and his two sisters lived a couple of houses up from him. I think my father had bought houses from his mother and the aunts. And the old high school was on E Street, just up the block from us, across the street. I can remember – CE: Would you locate that old school? Is that almost where the branch of the Bank of Marin now is, on the corner of Fourth and E? EB: It’s on the southwest corner, Fourth and E, southwest corner. And the Redwood Bank is right across the street from it. CE: I see. EB: And then, right on that same place across the street, do you remember that darling church, Anne? AK: Yes. EB: With the wonderful pine tree there. AK: Wasn’t that the one that was moved, or no? EB: No. The high school was not on the corner. It was St. Paul’s Church that was on the corner there, and that was the one that was moved to its present location. CE: I see. EB: And I can remember that very well because my great friend, Kathleen Bradley, her father was a minister there for quite a long time, and I used to go down to her, where they lived on Fourth Street. The old house is still there where the minister lived. I noticed it the other day. AK: He’s the one who afterward became the head of the old Tamalpais Center. EB: I think so. I first went – Because I was raised a Catholic, I first went to this gymnasium at this old church when I was six years old. There was a gym class on Saturday mornings which Miss Whitchy conducted. CE: Miss Whitchy? EB: That’s all I – I don’t remember how her name was spelled. CE: That’s great. EB: And maybe it wasn’t that. Maybe it was my childish pronunciation, but I remember that was lots of fun. CE: Well, it seems to me that your parents really planned your activities and your education and your life. It was quite structured. And then you just enjoyed it and worked around it. You didn’t appear to be at loose ends. EB: Oh, no, no. CE: Come Sunday, Saturday, you had things to do. EB: Yes. And then, you see, my sister Frances was very, very ill for a long time. She was about 2 1⁄2 when one day she just didn’t walk. To make a long story short, my  father had Dr. Wickman, who was a doctor then who said her head was too large for her body. Then Dr. Sherman – You know the Shermans. AK: Yes. EB: And he wanted to break her spine in two, which my father wouldn’t allow. When we moved, I found all his old medical books, apparently, which he perused, and then my father ran into a Dr. Hunken, a bone man in San Francisco, who brought her around. But she was sick for about four years and not walking. I won’t go into all the details now. But anyway, I think that I had my own way a great deal, too, because Mother wouldn’t know where I was, and she’d say, “Where have you been?” And I’d just been for a little walk down the – CE: All the energies were centered and turned towards your sister. EB: I remember going to the San Rafael hill and picking a spray of poppies and brodiaea. I never minded going off alone like that for some reason or other, and you could in those days. CE: You weren’t too far from that tunnel. EB: No, no, and there weren’t too many houses. CE: There weren’t too many houses. EB: We were really out of town, so to speak. CE: Yes. AK: I’m thinking Tom remembered going to Bolinas on the stage, and Dolly Jenkins remembered – EB: I can’t remember going on the stage, but I’ve been told I was taken over when I was six weeks old. CE: Were you? EB: Over the mountain. And the family stayed with Mrs. Hiram North. And Hiram North was one of the stage drivers, and that’s where mother learned to make apple pie. And that old Nott House is still there. AK: That’s still there yet. EB: And every summer we – When I was growing up, we didn’t own a house in Bolinas then, but we rented a cottage, or we stayed at one of the boarding houses: Mrs. Gilfillan’s or – I can’t think of the other man’s name down there who had the Bolinas Villa. And even some summers, if the family didn’t go over, I would go over and stay at the Villa and someone would chaperone me there. I loved Bolinas very much. And then later on we owned a house up on top of the little mesa. And curiously enough, the George Boyd Family had a house at the other end of the little mesa. CE: Was this house that you acquired in Bolinas, at one time occupied by the Wisbys? EB: Oh, yes. Mr. Wisby owned the house. CE: Did you know him? EB: Oh, yes. I think – I recollect Mr. Murray – I think Mr. Wisby was ill, and he needed money, so he really had to sell the house, and Mr. Murray told my father, and they bought the house in the late ‘20s. I think Mr. Wisby outlived my father by four or five or six years. Anyway, we enjoyed it very much, and the reason Mother sold it in the mid ‘40s is because we lost out front about 15 to 20 feet of cliff. CE: Oh, it was right up there.  EB: Yes. We could see the Legion of Honor on a clear day, and it worried her. I’m sure it will be there in my lifetime. But it’s right back to the front fence. CE: The house is still there? EB: Yes. And the Audubon Canyon Ranch – There’s a picture of it, before we bought it, I think, when Wisby first built it, and the title is “Erosion.” AK: You could look down on Dolly’s house. EB: Right. Or the Kent’s, or anybody’s. AK: And his sisters had the house right on top of the hill. EB: Yes. And they bought that from Mr. Williams, who is head of the Tamalpais School for Boys, who had built it after a place he had lived in in China. CE: You mentioned earlier, Betty, that your mother was a good friend of Dolly Jenkins. EB: No. CE: Or was it her mother? EB: No, I mentioned that her mother, Dolly’s mother, was the first one to call on my mother. Actually, Dolly Jenkins, I used to see her in Bolinas. I’d see Jim. And she would have her three children on the beach. And I used to think if I could be like that person when I grow up, and be married to a man who looked like that – CE: You’d be happy. Well, we just think she is a great person, and you know her now so well – EB: Yes, I think she is, too. CE: You used to go over every week, you told me, and take her out. EB: Well, I did after I retired. CE: How did that come about, Betty? When she moved to San Francisco? EB: Well, when Jim had died, and she was alone, and she had periods of depression, and she had always been so very, very kind to me at a time when I needed it, that I always felt very grateful, besides liking her very much. So, I would go over every Wednesday, or every two weeks and we would go on a jaunt. And Dolly was a wonderful person and she had all these weird places she wanted to go. And I saw a great deal of San Francisco which I never would have seen otherwise. We spent two days at Hunters Point, just rambling around. CE: She’s adventurous. EB: Right. And then after a while she didn’t feel so well again. But I saw her last fall and she – CE: Well, she’s come alive again, and she’s written her family history for all of her grandchildren and her great-grandchildren, isn’t it? AK: Yes. CE: And she had photographs and had copies made, and she is into it. EB: She was very active in Bolinas at the time that I was over there, and actually I was, for a year, “Mayor” of Bolinas. I should put mayor in quotes because anyone who was President of the Bolinas Club they called the unofficial mayor. And there are lots of wonderful stories about those days, too. For example, the comfort station which is in the park: that went up, I think, before I became President and Eddie Pape was the architect. Eddie wanted to put the very best up, and he put the very best fixtures in. The only problem was they had to be replaced  because the Bolinas pressure was not sufficient to operate these fixtures. Things like that engaged our meetings. CE: Who were some of the families you remember when you were going over there? Were the Dibblees going there then? EB: Oh, the Dibblees and the Guthries and the Suhrs. S-u-h-r-s. He was a big undertaker in San Francisco. AK: He came after and took the Newhall House. EB: Yes. And the Sharps were there before the Newhalls. They built that house. Old Dr. Bradford built that. AK: Oh, I never knew. EB: When I was a child, we lived on G Street in San Rafael, and Dr. Sharp was very strict. At 7:30 at night, if his daughters were on the beach, he would blow the whistle and they would have to come. Then we’d go out and play kick the can and come in a little bit later. Then the Newhalls bought that from the Sharps and then it became an inn for a while. And the Sharons, I guess, took it over to the present. CE: Do you still go over there, Betty? EB: Not very much. Oh, I remember all the Pepper family, too, and also the Howards, Henry Howard, and the Kents. If I had my album here with all the pictures – And there are many people that came up from San Francisco for the summer. The Merritt girls, their father was an attorney in the city. CE: Well, how would you get out there? Mostly by car? EB: Yes. My father, I think, had the third automobile in San Rafael. He bought a car in 1910. And it used to take us maybe three hours over White’s Hill to get to Bolinas. It was a journey. When we went over in the summertime, he would usually take us in the car and then he’d come on weekends. And he would ordinarily go up to – take the train from Mill Valley up to West Point and then walk down. And if we weren’t too tired he’d walk to the end of the sand spit and whistle or call for someone to come over in a rowboat and bring him across to Bolinas. CE: That’s a good hike. EB: Other times he would go up to McKennan, who had a motorboat, and McKennan would take him over for ten cents or twenty-five cents or something like that. CE: Dolly’s got a photograph of McKennan’s Pier. And there’s a stick up there, and she said now that stick is very important. There was a road that went on the east side of the lagoon, and if that stick was covered with water you couldn’t get past a certain point, there was a low spot in the road. Do you remember something like that? EB: No, I don’t remember that. CE: So you’d always watch that stick and the tide. EB: I remember another time, my father had a launch, I guess they’d call them cruisers today, and he’d come up once in a while to Bolinas in the summer. I had a great party one time, he had me and all my friends. We went over to McKennan’s Gulch. AK: A cute little house and that’s all that’s left of it. CE: You had a great outdoor life, didn’t you, when you think, between San Rafael and going over to Bolinas.  EB: Yes, it really truly was. And another thing, as a child in Bolinas, I remember for example one night when Mrs. Bradley, she was the Dean’s wife, the minister’s wife, had a little party for her daughter, Kathleen. And two rowboats were hired, and we piled in the rowboats and went over to the sand spit where there were dunes and beautiful rows of pampas grass. I think it was pampas grass, wasn’t it, Anne? CE: I hope not, but that’s what it seems. EB: And we had a party out there. I don’t think we had hot dogs, I guess ice cream or something on that order. CE: Tell me – We might as well talk about it now. I know you have been very active in the Tamalpais Trail Riders. You have served as Secretary and Treasurer, I believe. EB: That’s right. CE: Were you in on the beginning of that, Betty? EB: I was one of the founding members of it. I guess Doris Schmiedell and I are the only ones living today that – CE: How does that come about, something like that? EB: Well, there weren’t too many riders then. The Tamalpais Conservation Club was a very active organization. It maintained the trails on the mountain. And as I understand it, there were hikers who objected to horseback riders breaking down the trails. So, I think it was really through the efforts of Mrs. Harry Moore and Doris that this small group was gotten together. And the aim was to maintain trails and to work with the Marin Municipal Water District to build new trails. And that we did. We built a number of new trails up there. CE: Did you form articles of incorporation and were you chartered by the state and all that? EB: Yes we did. Harry Scott, who was President of General Steamship Company, was one of our early Presidents. Mr. Harry Moore – CE: Is that the same Harry Scott who was the first Mayor of Ross? EB: Yes. CE: And Ross was incorporated in 1907. EB: Right. He was a mayor in Ross, I know. If he was the first one, I don’t know. And Mrs. Harry Moore, and Doris, and myself, and a gentleman by the name of Tommy Beckett came in. It was a small group to start with. I think the largest number when I was active was about 125 people. People from San Francisco – We really had some great times. We’d ask the Water District each time we wanted to have a breakfast ride on the property, or any activity of that sort, and we observed all their rules and asked anyone else to, such as no smoking on the trails or cutting brush and so forth. One of our best treks was a three-day overnight ride, which the Kent family was quite active in. AK: You know where it was? Tom and I helped cook that meal and it must be where the Kent Lake is now. EB: Well, it’s not quite, but it’s up at the end there. AK: I’d never been there before, nor since. EB: It was the old Deer Club. We rode to Bolinas from the Meadow Club, and we stayed at Lumley’s Tavern. Dolly Jenkins had a cocktail party for us that night  and there were twenty-one on the trip, and they were all ages. Our youngest were eighteen and nineteen. Nancy Caruthers and Mary Keekler and Betty Barnes up to Russ Smith and I think Russ was probably about the eldest. Ernest Stratten was along. And the wives were invited who didn’t ride, to join us at dinnertime and spend the night. Gladys Smith came the first night, and I think maybe she saw that it was a very decent crowd. She didn’t come the second night. The next day we rode along from Bolinas up to the Tevis Ranch to Olema, and we put our horses up in the big red barn that’s on at the Point Reyes National Seashore. Some Trail Rider friends of ours were leasing the property and they met us. And we arranged for the horses there, and we stayed at Nelson’s Tavern overnight. CE: Now that’s the crossroads of Sir Francis Drake and Highway 1. EB: Right. CE: Right in Olema EB: Right in Olema. And then the next day we rode up past the cemetery on top of the ridge, and dropped down into the area which is now Kent Lake and then up the creek to – I’ve forgotten the name of that Deer Club. The Water District closed it about four or five years ago. And Mr. and Mrs. Kent had come in with lunch for us there. And their daughters had drawn us up for the darlingest little program for the weekend. CE: How nice. EB: It was really quite an outstanding event. I think it might be interesting to mention that outside of any money that was spent in a bar, all it cost any individual was $6.50: hay for the horses, two nights’ lodging. CE: What a time and a wholesome – EB: They brought their own lunches. AK: Was Dr. Stanley there then, too? EB: No. Dr. Stanley was not on that ride. I think he wasn’t here then, or he was still in Sausalito. AK: Ernest Stratton, who I think just died this month, had been sick. EB: He had been very sick. AK: And his wife was with us. She helped us on the cooking. And she was worried all the time because it was the hardest thing he had done since he’d been sick, and he came in just blossoming. He just loved it. EB: This was Decoration Day, May, 1941. Just before World War II. AK: Something like that. I couldn’t remember. CE: Are you still active in this organization, Betty? EB: No, I maintain membership just as a matter of sentiment, but I hardly know anyone anymore. CE: Do you still ride? EB: No, I rode up until about ten years ago, I guess, and then I didn’t have a horse and I actually didn’t want one when I retired. But I was offered horses quite frequently. AK: I think your horse was the only one that was tethered at that stand, or whatever you call it. It belonged to Mrs. Kent before. We had no horse, and you came with your horse. EB: Oh, yes. During the war I didn’t have a car and I would ride my horse around.  CE: You did? EB: And I came out for lunch one day. CE: Did you? EB: With Mr. Bill Kent. CE: Of course, you were still living in the big house then. EB: Yes, oh yes. CE: As long as you could keep a horse there, it was wonderful. EB: We had plenty of room. Actually, I kept my horse usually in the summertime at the Marin Stables, and then I would keep them home in the wintertime. But we had the barn there from when we had horses, and we had a loft and we had plenty of room. CE: Betty, we haven’t touched on your vocation. You’ve mentioned a couple of times, after you retired – I understood – Is this correct? You were in the trading business, stocks. EB: Yes. CE: Isn’t that a rather extraordinary thing for a gal? EB: I was married right after I got out of college, and I was married for four years and then it broke up. And I went to business school because it was the only way to get a job. I think I went to business school three months. Then a friend of mine who was there knew a young man who was working for a man named Walter Duesenberg. I think this young man thought that he could get his girl a job. She didn’t want it, so I went over there. Mr. Duesenberg – CE: What year are we talking about? EB: This was 1932, I guess. And Mr. Duesenberg had a tremendous firm. Duesenberg, Whitman, they were New York, Honolulu, etc. and he sold it out to Dean Witter just before the crash. CE: I never knew that. EB: And he had this little office, a dear man, at San Francisco, an over-the-counter trading operation. He was very interested in his gold mines. And I walked into this office and he said, “Now, you’re a college graduate so you can sit down there and learn as much as you can about this.” And I wasn’t an expert secretary. I’d never hired out as a secretary, and just three months of business school. So he sat me down at this board and I didn’t know the difference between a bid and an ask. And the other man who was working there was reputed to be one of the smartest men on Montgomery Street, but he apparently had bad habits with the bottle. He disappeared and we never saw him again. And I was there for a year and Mr. Duesenberg decided to concentrate on his gold mines, and his shop was closed. I’d made some contacts on the street and I was hired by Wheatman Company. Then Roosevelt came into office, and Mr. Wheatman told me I might as well take a vacation, go to Europe, which meant I was no longer hired. And about that time, it was a short time before my father died, and I was living in town and had just gotten another job when he died, and this was January ’33. I came home. March came and the banks folded, and so forth. So I stayed home for about a year and a half and cleaned up, with the attorney that took over my father’s legal work and helped him in the office. Then I had a chance to go to work for a Los Angeles  firm called William R. Stotts Company which had a branch office in San Francisco. And I was there for ten years. CE: Was this a brokerage house? EB: William R. Stotts Company were members of the San Francisco and Los Angeles Exchanges. And I really learned the business here, because after I’d been there three months there was another man who had trouble with the bottle, and he was fired, and I was put in charge of the office for four or five months. And they, besides being members of the local exchanges, dealt in government bonds, municipal securities, and over-the-counter stocks, so I had a general education. I was with them for ten years. I was classified as an assistant trader and outside of myself there was only one other person on the street, an older person by the name of Elizabeth Baychard, who later was a partner in Ellsworth Company, and has since died. CE: You mean there were just you two women? EB: Who were recognized. CE: Who were recognized. EB: We were invited very often to the bond traders’ parties, and other parties which were purely masculine. So ten years later, for various reasons, I decided to leave the firm, and I stayed home for about three months and then got tired of that and went to work for Lee Kaiser who was a member of the New York Stock Exchange and who also has a similar operation. And Lee had a very fine office and I was there for a year. Times were not good. This was right after the war. He closed his Seattle office. Personnel came from there, relatives, etc., and so I no longer had a job. And I decided to get out of the business altogether. So I went to work for the Community Chest as administrative assistant to the campaign manager. And it was really very bad because I thought that my 14 year-old nephew could be doing what I was doing, and I felt that I had to stick it out for a year, but I was relieved because Mr. Peterson, who became Chairman of the Community Chest that year, sent over some of his experts to check the Chest over, and they expected to be there three weeks and they were there three months. Probably saw as much waste and duplication as I did. So their recommendation was that there be no more titles outside of someone who might be head of a certain division, to allot monies etc. and that no one be fired, but everyone be put into a stenographic pool. So I had the opportunity of resigning gracefully, and so I took another three or four months vacation and then I took a job with a man by the name of Phil Fisher, who had a very small operation. He was a very fine gentleman. And the Harris Bank of Chicago had decided to open an office after the war, and Mack Lewis was in charge, and I’d known him when he worked for C. J. Devine and Company. So Mack wanted me very much to come to work for him, because it was a one-man operation and I knew people on the street, and I knew the business locally and I didn’t feel as though I could leave Mr. Fisher unless quite a bit more money were offered, which it was. So I worked for the Harris Bank of Chicago for eighteen years, and – CE: Well, all those years, Betty, you were living in San Francisco? EB: In San Rafael. CE: In San Rafael.  EB: Except for a couple of winters when I was making the market opening, and then I lived in San Francisco just for the winter months because otherwise it meant getting the 5:25 milk train out of here and not getting home until five or six at night the way the trains and ferries ran. CE: So you did it all right in San Rafael? EB: No, I was employed in San Francisco, but I lived at home in San Rafael. The Harris Bank could deal in nothing but tax-free bonds because they were a bank, and government securities. And we ran quite an operation, we had the whole west coast and a direct line to Chicago and New York. CE: An extraordinary thing. EB: And for two people, our biggest year was 97 million, sales of securities. So when people ask me what I did there and I say, “Well, I did everything.” I was licensed by the state, I had a license to buy and sell. Mack would go away and I’d have charge of the office. CE: To counter young people today who are so with it with women’s liberation, etc., did you, as a lone woman then, with this other gal who was considered on the street, have any feelings that you were not being treated fairly, or – EB: Well, I think I didn’t have them so much, but everybody else did because I wasn’t paid an equal sum. CE: That didn’t bother you? EB: Well, no, it never really did, because I always felt I was being paid money. It was my duty to do a job and to do the best I could. Actually, I felt that I received benefits in other ways which people didn’t in those days. CE: For example? EB: Well, Pete Russell was President of the Harris Bank. He was in our office. He said to Mack Lewis, with whom I worked, he said, “Mack, I think if Betty is going to be with us, she’d better come back and visit the bank in Chicago.” And so this was arranged. I was the first woman who had ever been brought in from outside. There was a small office in St. Louis and one in New York. And I was put up at the Palmer House. I traveled first-class and the first night I was there the President and Vice President took me out and arranged for dinner and theater tickets, and so every so often I was brought back to Chicago and I was treated just as though I were a high-salaried person. CE: Without having to push for it and demand it, which seems to be the trend. EB: And when I retired, they had me back for my graduation, so to speak, and the Chairman of the Board had a luncheon party for me in the Director’s Room and a dinner that night at one of the country clubs. And I valued all of these associations very, very much. And I’d like to put in a plug about the Harris Bank, too, because they were the first bank – well, I mean the first people in the country – I think, just a little ahead of Sears, Roebuck who in 1916 put in a profit sharing plan for their employees. Then in 1941 or ‘42 they felt as if some of their employees might not have enough out of the profit sharing, so they put in a pension plan, out of which not one cent of an employee’s salary ever went. CE: They were certainly ahead of their time, weren’t they? EB: They certainly were. CE: Now, did you stay with them until you totally retired?  EB: Yes, and I had to – women had to retire at an earlier age then than they do now. And so I retired 10 years ago. AK: Is it still running? EB: Oh, yes, oh, yes. Actually, before the banking act went in, the Harris Bank had offices in Paris, London, all over, and the First of Boston Corporation is an outgrowth of their bond business. There was also Chase, Harris, Forbes which was also very well-known firm in those days. And it was a family bank, and you were treated as one of the family. I’m very proud of this association. CE: I can see that, and understandably. EB: Anyway, when I retired, they sent someone out to take my picture because I was written up in the paper, and they asked me what I was going to do with my retirement. And I said, “Well, I love the great out-of-doors,” and I was just as happy in a pair of blue jeans as I was in an evening dress or going to the opera or something like that, which is true. So most of the time since I’ve been retired I’ve been floating around in something better than a pair of blue jeans and doing a great deal for Marin Audubon and Audubon Canyon Ranch keeping house for my brother, and that’s about it. CE: Tell us, Betty, I know that your brother is interested in boating. Do you share this interest? EB: I love the water but I only go along as a passenger. He’s a male chauvinist. CE: Regarding boats. EB: But before he trained the boys and went out with them, why, I used to be handy in the galley and I still am handy to a certain extent. When he goes on a cruise I make them an Apache stew or something like that, which they take along. CE: But short little trips. EB: Oh, I go out on Sundays. CE: On Sundays and out the Delta. EB: Well, not overnight because actually I wouldn’t care much about going. Tom’s boat is a 46-foot schooner. It takes a crew, and the quarters are such with the head and the bunks, it’s really not a place for a woman overnight. It’s not like one of the nice cruisers that – CE: Well, now, your brother is, what, about 10 years younger? EB: Ten years younger than I. EB: Right. And he’s senior partner, and it’s Nelson, Boyd, MacDonald and Tarrant. Dave Menary was one of the partners. He’s is now a judge. And Tom Nelson died a couple of years ago, so Tom’s really the senior partner. CE: As you grew up in San Rafael, did you know the Martinellis? EB: Very well. And my father, I think, was a rival of Jordan Martinelli’s father in the early days running for certain things. When you grew up in San Rafael you knew practically everybody in those days, Carla. You remember, Anne, you could walk up Fourth Street and I’d know the shoe black man, you’d go to Albert’s which was a big department store, and you’d know everybody in there, and whoever ran the movie house. A great life. CE: Well, everybody we’ve met during this project we’re involved in shows that same warmth as you do. Certainly the Freitas family does, the Martinellis.  EB: Of course, there were many other things like the old Marin Golf and Country Club, which was part of my life growing up. CE: Tell us about that. Where was that located? EB: Well, that’s out in east San Rafael, called the Country Club area now. It has a nine-hole golf course and a swimming pool and dances. CE: There was much more social life within the community. EB: Well, people didn’t have as much to do. We’d ride our bikes out there, or ride our horses over, or even hike over. And it was really a great life. Weren’t afraid to walk. AK: The young man who talked about the Pony Express, took it over and owned it – EB: Yes. CE: How did that come about? What do you mean “owned it the Pony Express”? EB: Well, actually the Marin Golf and Country Club – There were certain members who wanted an 18-hole golf course, and there was a split, and that was the origin, how the Meadow Club started. And the war years came along, and the Marin Golf and Country Club had quite a hard time and I’ve forgotten whether it went into bankruptcy or what. But then this Smith – Wasn’t that his name, Anne? AK: Yes. I forget his first name, kind of a funny fellow. EB: And he was a – You probably know more about this – AK: Well, I don’t know too much. CE: Did he buy the property and the clubhouse? AK: He bought the whole thing and has made it a little museum of the Pony Express. A little house in back still is – CE: You mean he’s a history buff interested in – AK: So far as that’s concerned. Now, he was very interested in – He told many things about the Pony Express that people thought were not exactly so. But anyway, it was the big thing in his life. He talked Pony Express – He just thought there was no other interest in life for him. Now he’s dead and the place is still a museum and I don’t think anybody had taken the things away. It’s still there. EB: Oh, incidentally, speaking of Marin Golf and Country Club, the Marin Yacht Club is really an outgrowth of that because there’s a little land down there. I’ve forgotten, think it was Summers Peterson. AK: Yeah. EB: I used to go there when we could swim in the canal. Just a few people had boats and we used to – AK: Mr. Hind must have had a great deal to do with it. EB: I don’t remember Mr. Hind. I’ll tell you who else. There was Captain Cook. Lucy Cook is still alive, his sister. That is now the private Yacht Club in here in the county. CE: Were any of the McNear family – EB: And Tom is the oldest living charter member of that now. AK: Oh. CE: Your brother is? EB: Yes, he started as a junior member. CE: Is that where Russell keeps his boat? EB: Yes, Russ keeps his boat there.  CE: Did you play with any of the McNear children, or know them? EB: Oh, yes, I knew them all. Actually, I live in Glenwood now and Miller McNear, before he died, was at the house a few years ago. And I said, “Miller, where was it where we used to ride out of your back yard, and over to past China Camp?” And he said, “Well, you know Knight Drive, there?” And I said, “Yes.” And he said, “Well, the creek’s right in back and we used to ride right up hill over the gap.” I used to ride with him a great deal, particularly after Kate McNear, I mean Kate Bradley. Dee Bradley’s daughter married Miller McNear and that’s really about the time I came to go. CE: Did you ever ride over to China Camp? EB: Oh, yes. CE: Do you have any memories of that? EB: We’d go out to China Camp and for 25 cents we’d buy a big bag of shrimp and a bottle of beer and eat the shrimp and drink the beer and tie up our horses. CE: At one time there were supposed to have been close to 3,000 Chinese there. EB: Well, I don’t remember that. I just – AK: That would have been very, very early. CE: Oh, before your time, I realize that, but now there are none left, are there? AK: Well, yes. I don’t know. CE: Well, the shrimp disappeared, too, didn’t they? EB: They’re coming back. CE: They are? EB: Yes. AK: It must be where Stanley goes. EB: Well, that Kent Grace, she died, I think, but it’s still going but whether it’s a relative or not, I do not know. CE: Betty, now, we’ve concentrated on your father a little bit but we’ve neglected your mother. You said she was a San Francisco gal? EB: Mother was a San Francisco girl. She had an older sister named Cora. CE: What was her maiden name again? EB: Verdenal. CE: And her first name? EB: Grace. CE: Grace Verdenal. EB: And Mother had a brother who was the youngest, John Verdenal. He died when he was about 21 of, as it was called in those days, consumption. He had been sent to Arizona. He was a protégé of Mr. Pillsbury of Pillsbury, Madison & Sutro and would have had quite a future, I guess. Mother went to Girl’s High in Miss Denman’s School in San Francisco. She met my father through her brother who had a job of sorts with the Call Bulletin, and had met my father when he came over here to interview him for something, and they were married in January, 1903. Mother’s father graduated from Harvard Law School and was a practicing attorney in San Francisco when one day he was on Market Street and a runaway team of horses came along and kicked him fifteen feet in the air. He was unconscious for weeks and never really quite strong enough to go back to his law practice. And he would do newspaper articles for various papers around here, and  CE: EB: CE: EB: CE: EB: CE: EB: CE: EB: CE: EB: CE: EB: CE: EB: CE: EB: CE: EB: CE: EB: CE: EB: CE: EB: CE: lived a rather quiet type of life. He and my grandmother – Incidentally, Grandpa was 16 years older than Grandmother and was 32 or 33 when he married. He and his family, mother, father, and younger brother, Dominic, came to California in 1852 on a wagon train from St. Louis, or rather from St. Joseph, Missouri, to landing in Placerville in October, 1852. That was a long trip. How come? Well, according to a journal which the two boys wrote and which we have, and incidentally which the Bancroft Library made a copy of – Well, that’s good to put in the record. This is a fascinating document and you are going to seriously consider having it published. Yes. Arlen Philpott would like to do a special edition on it and I think he will. And how did they get to Placerville? They came by wagon train and apparently the trip was supposed to be of much shorter duration than six months, but Mr. Ellsworth who ran the wagon train was not as honest a man as he might have been, and there was a great deal of dissention and dissatisfaction. Anyway, they arrived in Placerville in October 12, 1852. I think that they did not come seeking gold. They were there for about three weeks, and then they came to San Francisco, and these two boys were then sent back to the University of St. Louis for education, and then on to Harvard Law School. Well, their parents – Their parents remained here. The Wells Fargo Bank Exhibit has an address for my great-grandfather on Dupont Street in San Francisco. Famous, infamous Dupont. Right. Later became Grant Avenue. Right. And also in their list of telephone – First hundred telephone subscribers, my Uncle Dominic has two telephones. Two! And this was because he was Secretary, Treasurer of the Mining Exchange in the days of the Comstock Lode days. Isn’t that fascinating? And he had a telephone in his home and one at the Exchange. Do you have any family pictures of those homes, by any chance? No. No the only thing I have – How far back do you go? I have an oil of my great-grandmother, my father’s mother, and one of my grandfather. Grandfather John? John. And we also have my great-grandmother’s passport from Nantes, France in 1937, I think it is. Her maiden name was Rezy, R-e-z-y. Now this is – You’re talking about John’s wife? John’s mother. Mother. John Verdenal’s mother. Yes, my great-grandmother. Your great grandmother, and she’s French.  EB: She’s French. My grandfather and his brother were born in upper-state New York. They apparently had relatives on his mother’s side in Ohio. I haven’t been able to trace this too much in Medina County. Anyway, to get back to Grandpa, after mother was married, he and my grandmother came to live in San Rafael. Their eldest daughter, Cora, did not marry. She taught school and her first school was in Fresno County where she boarded out. And then for a number of years she was in Tucson, Arizona, and she died in a flu epidemic in 1918 or ’19, whichever it was. And then my little grandmother came to live with us, and Grandmother’s stories were marvelous. I wish I had written them down or remembered them. For example, she told us that during the rush days when everyone was very excited about the mines, how the husbands, when they made a killing, would buy jewels and then if they lost, they had the jewels to cash in and have ready money at hand. CE: Well, she was living – I’m trying to think of the year she would be living there. EB: Well, Jane Verdenal was born in 1856 in the east and she came with her family across the Isthmus by rail, and then to California by boat. Her maiden name was Lawlor. It’s not the common Lawler spelling, I always forget whether it’s “o-r” or “e-r.” And her father, I think, was kind of a rascal because sometimes he’d be a judge and sometimes he would be in the jug for drinking too much, up in Vallejo, or Benicia. You’re really getting a case of back history here, Carla, about which I’m a little vague, it’s all hearsay as a child. CE: Well, part of it, little pieces will fit in, won’t they? EB: And one of her brothers – she was from quite a large family, as I recollect – was vice president of Sutton Christianson Lumber Company in San Francisco. CE: Tell Anne who we’re talking about. EB: I’m talking about Grandmother Verdenal. CE: Did she speak French in the home? EB: No, no, but I can remember her mother, little Grannie, they came – No, it was her mother, I guess, who came from Philadelphia. But Grannie was quite a person. She went to New York by herself on the train at the age of 72 to visit her cousin who was 96 or 97. And Grannie told how they were in Washington Square and Grannie was always very hard of hearing. They couldn’t do anything for her, her inner ear drum. But she said, “I and my aunt, she had one of those hearing aids, and we’d take turns, and soon all little children in the park were looking at us thinking we were not quite right in the head going like this.” CE: Now, I want to get back to that wonderful journal that your grandfather and his brother, Grandfather John and his brother, Dominic Verdenal, wrote as young boys, age about 12, when they accompanied their parents on the trek across the United States coming to California. Now, you have this remarkable journal in your hands. Would you read the introduction, a little bit, or the beginnings of the journal? EB: Yes, this is headed The Journal of John and Dominic Verdenal from St. Louis, Missouri to Placerville, California by Land. “We started from St. Louis, Missouri on Monday, April 26, 1852 in the train of P. H. Ellsworth for California. The train was called ‘The El Dorado Train.’ It consisted of thirteen wagons, each wagon was numbered, ours was number four, and about 75 persons, about 200 head of cattle and 15 horses. Our provisions served as follows: bacon in  quantity, about 12 hams, dried apples, beans, and flour – but enough till Salt Lake City, cornmeal, plenty of pilot bread, coffee, tea, sugar, salt, rice and pepper. P. H. Ellsworth, the owner and operator of the train, was an American and had been to California once before across the plains. He had a tyrannical disposition as the sequel will show. He advertised in the press three months before departing that the train was in readiness at any time. The price for passage fixed by him was $100 per person through to California. He received this money from 75 persons about six weeks before starting, and then he hastily collected his train and thus established himself without capital. But to proceed, there were eight families in the train. There were about 75 persons as stated, out of which there were about ten ladies, five boys and girls, and the rest were men. Wagons were of a rather small size and were each covered with an awning. Monday, April 26th, we departed from St. Louis, Missouri at about eleven o’clock. All had gone on very well until we had gained about four miles when the tongue of the wagon, number seven, broke, which obliged us to lay by at the ‘Star Tavern’ in Bellview until next morning. The cattle went along at a fine rate at about five miles per hour. Fires were kindled, coffee made, and we fished for the first time and had a real taste of life on the plains. Just about eight o’clock as we had tumbled in bed it commenced to rain and continued till after ten a.m. – came about four miles. Tuesday we had a hard time catching and yoking up the cattle, they being rather wild. We finally got ready and started from camp at eight and a half o’clock. Nothing of interest occurred today. Camped at five o’clock, came sixteen miles.” CE: Isn’t this – And it goes on and on. EB: This as a day by day journal until arrival. CE: From April until, when was that, October? EB: October 12th at Hangtown, California, now known as Placerville. AK: Can you go back and find where they finally crossed the mountains? EB: Well, here it does mention Placerville. They were at Genoa here, apparently, so they must come across the mountain soon, because they came over the Kit Carson Pass. CE: Well, do you want to read that part that you marked there? EB: This is on Sunday, September 5th. “Started at eight in the morning. Met many returning Californians, mostly packers. They gave us a California newspaper and gave us some news of California. They thought we could not go over the mountains, the Sierra Nevada, this season, and believed we would be forced to spend the winter in Carson’s Valley. Camped by the side of a trading post where several of the cattle were exchanged for fresh ones. Came 19 miles.” CE: Do you think they could have been at Genoa? EB: I wouldn’t be surprised because there was a trading post there. AK: Yes, I think so. CE: There was that Mormon trading post there when it was the Utah Territory. EB: Because when I was there a couple of years ago, I spent about three or four hours there, which is a lot. CE: Isn’t that a fascinating place? EB: I went all through the museum. AK: I haven’t been there yet. Mention, too, how beautifully it is written.  CE: Oh, it is, beautifully – And the penmanship is wonderful, and it’s in a neat, even hand and so legible. EB: Everything is excellent, except they don’t seem to punctuate. CE: No, and here we’re talking about something 125 years after it was written. But it’s interesting, now that we’re talking about the money for a moment, the $100 to cross the plains to come to California, and there were four of them! EB: Four of them, right. CE: Now, it still was cheaper than going around the Horn, which took $200, I’ve been told, to go by sailing ship from out of New York, say, and it took much longer. Of course, this was extended because of the team master. EB: Another thing, they were in Ohio, you see, and they apparently decided to take this. At least that’s what we assume. We assume that maybe the boys were sent back to the University of St. Louis because it would be near Medina County, in Ohio, where there were relatives on his mother’s side. That’s just an assumption. CE: We’ve been doing some research on this lately and I think it’s fascinating when you think of the American frontier for 200 years from the time of the beginnings of our country, the settlers pushed westward. It took them 200 years to get as far as the Mississippi, then within two decades, within 20 years, they pushed all the way, 2,000 miles, to the Pacific. It’s fascinating. EB: It is. Well, to me it’s simply fascinating the way people left home to come to this country originally, leaving everything they knew. Of course, in a sense it was better because they didn’t have press and they didn’t know all these other things now. CE: Well, it was a great big question mark. You know when those first immigrant trains set out with Bartelson in 1841 they didn’t have any reports back from those trains so people assumed they got through all right. EB: And often I think of Father Junipero Serra. CE: But don’t you think there is something innate in the American character that is a frontier person? They’ve always been interested in going on the move. EB: That’s true. CE: And if adversity would strike – There was a period around the 1840s when malaria was prevalent in the central valleys there and they’d just move on then. EB: I’ve been rather interested that more people haven’t moved on to Alaska. CE: Well, that’s a treasure to have in your family. EB: I remember my grandfather, for a young person, fairly well, because as I say I was the eldest and he used to bring me books to read all the time from the Sausalito Library. When my Uncle Will owned the paper down there I think Grandpa used to do little news articles sometimes. CE: What was your Uncle Will – What was his name? EB: He was my father’s brother, William Boyd. CE: He had the paper down there? EB: He owned the newspaper there, the Sausalito News, and he was also the Postmaster. See, I guess my father really had it sewed up politically with a brother owning a newspaper. CE: Yes. We interviewed a woman down in Sausalito. What was her name? Wosser, Mabel Wosser. Did you know that name?  EB: I know that name. CE: Wosser sisters, there were six of them. AK: It had to do with – Always an engineer on something on the – EB: Oh the ferry, yes. CE: He was the engineer on the Princess. AK: And all his boys followed either on the trains or ferry. EB: Well, I have a young friend who – One summer she was going to Davis, had a job with whatever the newspaper in Sausalito now – this was about eight or ten years ago – if there still is one. Well, Sally apparently became fascinated looking at files, and she was quoting all these things to me. I drove her up to Tinsley one time when we were going up for the weekend. What she read – CE: Well, the early paper in Sausalito had a reporter for each part of the area of Marin. There would be a column on Ross Valley, a column, as I understand it, on San Rafael, and you’d get the news. EB: And, of course, another thing I can remember as a child, too, but occasionally going to lunch at the old Reed place there. CE: Well, now tell us what you mean by the old Reed place. I see you have a photograph of your father. Is this a descendent of the owner of the rancho? EB: Yes, this was John Paul Reed who was the last male heir there. Actually, he was my brother’s godfather, and when he died, he left Tom 70 acres of – all where that Koch Luggage Company is, all along there, that road. But there was never any right-of-way on account of the railroad track, and Tommy, I think, sold it in the ‘40s. His sister was my sister, Frances’, godmother and Lucretia Little will tell you that they never found her will, and she’ll give you all the dirt about that because it was a great thing, you know, for godchildren, they were always remembered, not that it makes any difference to us. But we used to be at the Reed place quite a bit, old Mrs. Reed. CE: Now where was that property, Betty? EB: It’s kind of hard to describe now, but – Because you can see the old palm trees of the place. It would be before you got very far on the Tiburon Boulevard. CE: Okay, now we’ve got the map, Betty. EB: Well, after you start on Tiburon Boulevard, you go past the Sierra Bank on your left, then you go down a little hill and, if I remember rightly, it would be where that first stop light is, that you might turn in left there. CE: Oh, you turn left and go up to the left? EB: Yes, and that’s where the house was, up in that area. I think that I discovered it one day because I was just browsing around. I’d often wondered where it was and Frank Howard Allen had a new sub-division area going in, and I rather wandered and saw some of the palm trees and remnants. I can’t tell you the name of the street, but I could take you there. CE: But that’s always a good landmark around Marin. You see palm trees and some evidence of a little wall or something, you’ve got an old estate. EB: And as I remember, we entered further up when we used to go to their house and the railroad track ran along side the driveway. I’m just pulling this from memory now as I talk. And there were palm trees all along the driveway, that would have all been torn down a long time ago. The house was on a little knoll and I can  remember there were chickens running around outside, but it was a very nice Victorian type of house as you walked in. And I suppose in a Spanish way it was rather – It was rather well-to-do for that period. And I remember particularly Sunday meals, because we’d have chicken and then we’d have some beans and I loved them and I begged Mother to do them that way, but she wouldn’t because she said they weren’t digestible, they were fried in lard.. CE: Interesting. EB: And Mrs. Reed, Carlotta, the mother of John Paul Reed, Clotilde Reed, stayed up one night until two o’clock in the morning before Christmas to finish petticoats for us, all hand-inset lace which she had made. And my sister, I believe, still has some of those petticoats which she kept as a matter of sentiment. CE: Well, at that time what were they doing with the land? Was there any stock left on it? EB: I truly don’t remember. CE: I guess not, Mrs. Kent. EB: I was a very small child when this occurred, and I think John Reed died in 1919. I think his sister died not too long afterwards. CE: Well, this photograph you have is marked “1910 or ‘12, Portola Parade, San Francisco. John Reed with Thomas P. Boyd.” EB: Lucretia Little borrowed that for her files and we couldn’t remember the name of the Portola Parade, and she put this on, whether it was 1910 or ’12, this big celebration took place in San Francisco. And Papa and John Reed took their horses over on the ferry boat and this was taken somewhere in San Francisco. CE: That looks like downtown San Francisco. EB: So that was quite a trip, I guess. CE: Mrs. Kent, how about reminiscing a little with Betty here. We have this scrapbook that your father kept, a wonderful thing. EB: Well, this is really around the turn-of-the-century, before he was District Attorney, and then I think ends probably right around the time he becomes District Attorney. CE: I saw a photograph the other day, Mrs. Kent, and I want to get a copy for Dolly Jenkins. It shows the Eldridge House, where Macy’s is today. EB: I remember that house. CE: Do you, dear? EB: Do you remember in the war, Anne, when they used it for Red Cross, World War II. AK: Yes, we used it for many different things, and then it was the Extension of the county. CE: Next door to it, I believe if I’m correct, was her Uncle Lee, Lee family, then the Evans family, then the Dufficy. EB: The Evans family lived up, I think, on – Well, maybe when Dolly was young they lived down there. Later they lived on Mission. AK: Yes, later, that’s right. CE: Well, that’s an unusual photograph. And she has one of the family home, people on the porch including Bridgette the maid and the coachman by name. And she’s remarkable in identifying her photographs.  EB: She’s wonderful. CE: She has a photograph of the whole student body at San Rafael High School in 1907. There are 84 people in the picture and she knows the names of all of them. AK: Well, there was no Audubon going on in those days, but I was thinking of the Audubon when you were talking about the Reed house and everything because the Audubon House was part of that original estate out there, wasn’t it? EB: Well, I understand that John Paul Reed – Mrs. Verrall was his lady love before she married. AK: Oh, I didn’t know that. EB: And he gave her part of this property and then she married a Verrall and lived on there. AK: Became the goat lady. EB: Yes. Actually, the Reeds had this big grant that took in all that area, took in Paradise Cove and Belvedere. AK: Tremendous, yes. EB: Dr. Lyford married Hilarita Reed. AK: That’s right. EB: So, the Lyford House was moved by barge from Strawberry over to its present location there, and – CE: What is its use now? It belongs to the Audubon Society. EB: Well, the Marin Conservation League, Mrs. Livermore and Mrs. Kent and many others, as I understand it, secured this property, saved it, and then, correct me if I’m wrong, Anne, because they couldn’t really have the money to keep it up. Mr. Baker, John Baker, who was President – You know more about this than I do, Anne. AK: I wasn’t in on this. Caroline, I don’t know how much money she put in, but I know she went and asked about the house and the people said, “Yes, you could have the house but you ought to take it away.” Then she went to the right people, contractors, I guess, told them her tale, and they said they would move it. We all thought it couldn’t be done. And then she some way got the people to get the foundation all ready, properly made on that place, knowing all the while that it would come by barge and – You realize this, Carla, it had to be taken down hill from where it was, put on a big barge, taken a distance on the water, and then be brought up a good, steep, crooked hill. And they did it all and they did the whole thing. Then Mrs. Dickey said that she would furnish it in memory of her husband who was a great “bird man” and wrote wonderful bird books. And Mrs. Verrall, the goat lady, agreed to most of these things if she could have her own living quarters there, and they fixed it up, a little outside one it was. And I think she was very difficult to live with. They paid her by the month. They gave her a big price, too, and I think that was all Audubon money. I’m not sure. Maybe Caroline put some in. Then she got to be quite a nuisance, too, to the young people or the young whatever they were, the people who were hired by the Audubon, because she would come in every night. She would come in and stay in their house until she got ready to go to bed out in her little shanty and it got to be quite a lot of trouble to put up with her. And I guess she got more and more difficult. Then they fixed her quarters up better, thinking that she’d be more satisfied to live over  there, and I don’t know how it ever worked out in the end, but now she’s gone and it’s newly-decorated and it’s a – Oh, not only that. How did they go about getting the Whittell money? I never will understand that, do you know? EB: Well, Anne, I don’t know exactly because I remember reading the paper four or five years ago when Mr. Whittell died, and there was great controversy over his will, and to whom the money should go. As I recollect, the Humane Society was involved to some extent, and then the next thing I knew was the National Audubon had gotten a great big chunk of it. And we have so much money to spend here in Marin County of that Whittell money. The National Audubon gave a certain amount of the funds to build this education center there and also besides that we were allotted, Marin Audubon was allotted, I believe it was $75,000. We’ve so far used $25,000 of that to buy the marsh outside of Mill Valley there. $15,000 has gone towards the Heerdt Marsh, and $10,000 towards the Triangular Marsh. That money has not been used yet but it’s in escrow to do so, and then also $25,000 was allotted to Strawberry Point and that has not been used yet but it’s held in abeyance for that. CE: When did you get involved in the Audubon Society, Betty? EB: Well, as I said, when I retired, I liked the out-of-doors. And I’ve been a member of Marin Audubon – never thinking about birds or anything – since 1959 or ‘60 when they saved that Utah Construction Company from getting in down there where – I guess from building all along Richardson Bay where Zaro’s is. I liked what they were doing that way, so I joined them. And I’d get their bulletins, and I read about Elizabeth Terwilliger and her trips, and I like to ride horseback and I like to bicycle ride and I like to do a great many other things. So, really I became involved with Terwilliger who really got me going and I still see a great deal of her. We’ve been spending every Thursday together and my brother always says, “Where are you going?” and I tell him I’m going out with “Twig,” as I call her or refer to her, and I say, “Tommy, I don’t know until I get home and then I’ll tell you.” CE: Mrs. Kent and I think we ought to interview her sometime. Do you think she would agree to it? EB: Oh, I’m sure Elizabeth would love to. CE: Well, tell her about it, tell her what Mrs. Kent’s project is and maybe you could arrange it, Betty. EB: Because hers would be a little later period, but she covers so much, and she, to me, has done ever so much for Marin County. AK: She surely has. EB: She’s done a great deal for young people and for people my age and many other people, too. I just think that she’s a terrific, and she’s a dedicated person. AK: Indeed, she is. EB: I took her for two or three years. I didn’t take her, I drove her, down to Pescadero, to the Outdoor Conservation Education School of Marin County. That’s 150 miles round trip, we’d spend the day there. My car would be full of her frozen birds and they would be all right going down, but they weren’t so good coming home sometimes. But she would not take a cent of money for that. She’s truly dedicated.  AK: That’s great. Now those classes of children – That’s where I saw you not too terribly long ago. Oh, I guess it was wrong because Mr. Baker was still living. That’s the last time we ever had him. EB: Yes. AK: And John Baker, he was one of the most wonderful people in the world, I think. He came out here and he came to the convention down south and he said that he would come and stop here if he could, and he did. He came to see us and that was when we were trying so hard to save the island in Bolinas Bay, and he – We’ll never know how much he had to do with that and we’ll never know how much he had to do with a great many other things in Marin. But he came here. He wasn’t too terribly well, and I thought that he would have a little luncheon and he would have to rest. “Oh no,” he said. He didn’t have any time to rest. He wanted to go to Bolinas, Stinson, whatever it was. So, my daughter, Marty, took us and we went over and he hadn’t been here with us for years and years and we started out to go to Stinson Beach and we went through Fairfax and as we went through Fairfax we were going toward Olema and he said, “Oh I think when Tom took us last time we turned somewhere right here.” He remembered they went over the Alpine Road and, oh, he didn’t miss a trick. We went all the way over and the way back. He let us know that he had a dinner engagement in San Francisco that night with Kate Maillard and he didn’t want to miss a thing. We went to the Audubon House and he told us about the property next to the entrance which he afterward was able to save, and then he came back here and on to San Francisco and we got him in to the date on time. He was quite an elderly man. He was head of the whole National Audubon. Oh, a wonderful, wonderful person. CE: Are you involved in the Canyon Ranch project? EB: Oh, yes. I’ve been on their board now for about five years. It came about because I was appointed from Marin Audubon. In other words, Audubon Canyon Ranch is not owned by National. CE: I see. EB: It’s sponsored by the three local chapters of National: the Marin, the Golden Gate which is San Francisco, and the East Bay and Sequoia which is the Peninsula. And there are six members from each society. They’re appointed for a three-year term, then you’re sometimes re-appointed. And I’ve been fairly active on that in various ways and it’s really great because all the people with whom you come in contact are such fine people and you’re interested in the same thing and yet your paths may not cross otherwise. And I’m particularly interested in the Tomales Bay end now because every Tuesday I go to Cypress Grove, a little speck north of Marshall, which belongs to Clifford Conly who has willed it to Audubon Canyon Ranch. And there’s a small research group out there. Our main function the first year was on land use and studying the native habitat. So it’s really been about the ten of the best years of my life. AK: That’s really wonderful. CE: Well, I know when we went out to visit Boyd Stewart many times, and – EB: I’ve known Boyd and Josepha for a long time. CE: They’re just great. He was telling us on his first tape, I think, about the problem of the Point Reyes becoming a National Seashore and naturally, he had been in  ranching all his life. He didn’t want to give up his property either, but he thought it was the better thing to do than have all this growth out there. How do you feel in retrospect now, ten years later, about the Point Reyes National Seashore? EB: Well, Carla, for one thing, I worked very hard on that in ’69 with Peter Behr, and that’s when I really first came to know Peter in any way, and then I ran all his campaign scheduling for his campaign in 1970 and the last time. CE: He did much. He was our spokesman. EB: Right. And I had, of course, ridden horseback out there, been in that country. And I think I’m in favor of anything that would keep this county from being changed into a bunch of ticky-tacks. And one reason I love West Marin so is that, to me, having grown up here, is more like Marin was when I was growing up than anything else today. CE: Yes. You can go out there and still – going home. EB: You can breath fresh air and – CE: Now they’ve added all that Golden Gate National Recreational Area. EB: I know. I said to Peter Behr once, I said, “Peter,” who was out sailing with us, “I think that Marin County should be declared a National Trust County.” I said, “You know, as in England they have the National Trust that sets these things aside.” And Peter gets zany ideas, but he looked at me rather startled. He said, “Betty, I think it might be easier to do it if it were just for the birds.” You know, I don’t know what’s going to happen as there is a transportation problem, there always has been, and I do think – I would hate to see it cut up into macadam. I think it should be kept as much a wilderness as possible. Yet I think there should be something like – I’m not very ambulatory anymore. I have this degenerative arthritis in my feet and I can’t walk the way I used to. What if they had little elephant trains or something where people could be taken? I know they’re all working, a good many great people, but I just don’t think – There’s still some who, because they want it to be made into a park, think, “It belongs to me and no one else can get in there.” And I don’t – CE: No, that’s wrong. AK: That’s wrong. EB: But don’t you think there are, Anne? AK: Yes, I do think so, I do. CE: Well, now we were discussing at luncheon – We might as well discuss part of it now. There are some problems in Marin that are critical that have to be resolved, and we were discussing the water problem. Do you have any opinions as to the best way to settle that? What do you envision down the road? EB: Well, what I envision is that I pray that there won’t be another year like this one of drought, and I think something has to be done. The population is increased greatly. When we owned our house in San Rafael, as I mentioned earlier, we had our own spring water. We were always piped in for city water. I remember only one year in which city water was used. CE: In all the years you lived there? EB: Yes. And then it was used because it was a dry year. CE: This is really a historic drought.  EB: Yes. It was a dry year and we used that on the garden, but we still used the spring water for the house. I think something has to be done, but I think people can’t be ostriches and try to save this county from any more development because there’s bound to be some, and I think it’s better to face it and to go about it. CE: How do you envision this being handled? What kind of regulatory group – Or do you think – EB: I think we have a regulatory group already, Carla, in the Planning Commission. CE: In the Planning Commission. EB: And I think it is not the function of the Water District to do the planning. They should be serving the people and providing water. Now, I understand this ballot is going out for the Soulajule Dam and the – More water is needed. I also understand that voters are not going to be asked about the intertide at Atherton Avenue for Sonoma water. I’m questioning that judgment for the simple fact is that there still is water in Sonoma, and why put all your eggs in one basket? Also, why not give the people an opportunity to select both systems or which system? Now, legally it might be impossible to do that on the ballot. I don’t know, but I think it should be explored. CE: Well, of course, some of the problems are immediate: Stinson Beach where Mrs. Kent has her – EB: Well, they’re not in the Marin Municipal Water District. CE: No, but they have a serious water problem. EB: For instance, at Point Reyes they have been getting water from north Marin, which is the Novato area. CE: Point Reyes has? EB: Some of the Point Reyes people have been getting water from there. And Inverness has its own water. Bolinas, they’re running dry, too. But Marin Municipal Water District does not serve them at the present time. Audubon Canyon Ranch so far has its own water and has been very fortunate but that’s commencing to dry up a little bit. AK: Is it one big spring, or is it many for them? EB: Well, you see, I’m speaking of Audubon Canyon Ranch and I’m speaking of the Main Canyon, Anne, and Volunteer Canyon which are two separate canyons. And we’re by way of putting, digging wells and putting in tanks, that’s been approved and it’s going to go ahead right away. AK: Because there is a spring on the very, very top edge of their line, there’s a great big spring up there, I know. EB: So that is being done, and eventually they want to put in a gravity system, but it’s sort of beyond our financial means to do it at the moment, whereas we can handle the well digging and the tanks. CE: Well, you’ve lived close to three quarters of a century right in this area and just think what you’ve seen. EB: You know, I always hate to mention my chronological years for the simple reason that I become depressed. I feel that they’re becoming limited and my physical limitations are growing and I don’t want them to. CE: Well, I think you have a very objective outlook about Marin. You don’t want to close the doors and keep people out.  EB: Well, Carla, I’m not the only – I mean, there are all kinds of people and all kinds of people that make a living in this world and I think there has to be a good compromise. I believe in compromise. Except I also think that unless the people who are very dedicated, keep pushing that maybe we’d never get to a point of having a compromise unless they were around. CE: Do you have any dreams you’d like to see take place in Marin? EB: Well, I haven’t any particular dream here as things stand now, but I have a dream that I’d like to see this world a better place for people to live in. I’d like to see some respect coming back for authority and I’d like to see those in authority being people whom younger people look up to, and – CE: Can admire their actions. EB: Yes, and I think our culture had just deteriorated so terribly. It makes me almost cry some nights because it’s really a beautiful world in which we live. It truly is. CE: The schools? EB: We don’t vote for school bonds any more. My brother, Tom, was President of the Board in San Rafael for eight years and Tom said that when they used to put a bond issue on it was for a new gymnasium, a new library, a new floor, the money was pin-pointed, it’s carte blanche these days. He won’t vote for school bonds, and I go along with him on that. We see children coming out who can’t spell, who can’t write, and who are not even taught history anymore. CE: There’s a whole recent issue of the Saturday Review of Literature discussing that very subject. EB: And our life is history. We have to go back to Rome and Greece. CE: A high school student was asked to do a profile. They were studying American history on Hoover and they were discussing the Presidents, and he comes with his paper on J. Edgar Hoover, head of the F.B.I., he didn’t even know that we had a President Hoover. EB: That was one thing that I felt was good about the Centennial. I think that many young people have questions now about our history. They haven’t been taught in schools or haven’t thought about it. CE: Young people need to identify with tradition. EB: I learned something from that, too. We have about 46 states. AK: We have what? EB: 46 states. CE: What do you mean? EB: Well, there’s the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Delaware and then Rhode Island has a little bit more to its name. CE: Oh, isn’t that interesting? EB: I learned that on Cronkite’s program! CE: Did you watch the Tall Ships? EB: No, I just saw smatterings of it, but speaking of the ships – CE: Well, that’s a wonderful way to teach character to young people. EB: My brother was out for the weekend on his boat, and he had planned to go out in the ocean, but it was rather foggy so he spent the night at the Oakland Estuary and Sunday morning he started out early and he was under the bridge and the fog was so bad. He came up out, and the next thing he knew when the fog lifted enough,  he was leading the parade across the marina. He was in front of the fire boats. Of course, his two 15 year old boys were thrilled to death, that were with him. CE: Well, we have really gone back and enjoyed your reminiscing. I do want to mention, Betty, you’ve brought these lovely things of particular interest. Just perusing this scrapbook of your father, which starts in 1899 – EB: Would you like to look at it a little bit? I wouldn’t mind leaving that with you. CE: 1899, and then I think it runs up to 1907. This is probably just one of his, but it’s so interesting to me, been very interested too, Mrs. Kent, particularly on the history of the Ross Valley. EB: Well, that is interesting about Makin. CE: And here’s an action – sues for estate of Marin pioneer Robert Ross Makin in November of 1901. He brings charges against his aunt, Annie S. Moore for the estate of his grandmother, Annie Ross. And this goes on for quite a bit. EB: And Papa finally won that case for young Ross Makin. CE: What plans have you about this journal? Are you going to leave that to the Historical Society, perhaps your father’s scrapbook? EB: Well, I haven’t even thought about it. CE: Well, you might give that some thought, because this is good archival material. EB: Yes. I’m happy for the suggestion. CE: Yes, and that lovely journal, I know you’re going to do something with that. EB: Well, of course, the whole family – They’d probably like to keep it in the family. CE: Certainly, certainly. Well, Betty, we can’t thank you enough for coming and sharing your most interesting life with us. EB: Well, I thank you very much for being such good listeners, and for the nice lunch, Anne. I didn’t expect that. AK: And we’ve enjoyed it and we’ve learned so much. CE: There’s a lot of very good information on this, and I hope some historian in the future will enjoy it as much as we have. Thank you for coming. EB: Thank you.
MarinCounty;Ruth Boerike White Bowie;CE: Today is Wednesday, January 28th, 1976. Continuing the Oral History program at the California Room, Marin County Library at Civic Center, we are today at the residence of Ruth Boerike White Bowie at 501 Via Casitas in Greenbrae, California. Mrs. Bowie, a long-time resident of Marin, has been active in many charitable endeavors in this county as well as in San Francisco. And today she has agreed to share with us her reminiscences of not only her life but of the "Garden of Allah" which was her beautiful residence of many years in Mill Valley. Joining me today in this interview is Mrs. Thomas Kent of Kentfield, California. Good afternoon, Mrs. Bowie.          RB: CE: RB: CE: RB: CE: RB: CE: RB: it so CE: RB: when he was two or two and a half to three years old and so he was always brought up an Good afternoon, Carla. It's nice to have you here. Well thank you. Would you tell us, Ruth, where were you born? Born and raised in San Francisco. I was born in 1888. I’m now 87 years old. Were you born in your family residence, or in hospital? Oh no, I was born at our residence. At your residence. Were your parents born in California? No, my father was born in Austria, and my mother was born in New England. What was your father's name? William Boerike, William. My father had a middle name but he didn't care to use he was always known as Dr. William Boerike. What brought him to California? Well, his mother died in childbirth in Austria and his father brought him over American, you see. And his father married again after a few years and he had five more children, so my first husband had half sisters and brothers. CE: Where was your home standing at the time of your birth in San Francisco? RB: I don't know. CE: It wasn't the famous 1812 Washington Street? RB: No, it wasn't. CE: That was later? RB: Yes. Maybe I'll think of it later. CE: That's alright, Ruth. I understand you had a twin sister and five brothers, is that correct? RB: Five brothers, yes. CE: What were their names? RB: William Fay. William F. is my father and my mother was a Miss Fay, so it made a very good name William Fay Boerike, he was the oldest of my five brothers. And my second brother was Harold Edwin Boerike and he died in 1927, having married a New York widow and she was a typical New Yorker: lived and dreamed and everything that meant anything to her was social, she was a social butterfly. And she did nothing but entertain all the time, dinner parties, dinner parties, and entertain. She would sleep until noon everyday, but my dear brother Harold had to be down on Wall Street office before eight so he just absolutely didn't get enough sleep and so of course his health gave out and when he became sick my father came on from San Francisco to see what condition he was in. And when he arrived he turned to my brother and said, he called him Hallie but his name was Harold, he said, “Hallie you're a sick man. You should be in bed.” He said, “I don't want to go to bed, Father. I know if I go to bed I'll never get up.” CE: Well tell me who are your other brothers, briefly? RB: William Fay, Harold Edwin, Garth Wilkinson, Charles Kayland and Arthur Thatcher. CE: Are any of your brothers still alive? RB: None, they're all gone. CE: You survived them. RB: I'm the only surviving member of the family. CE: Tell me, Ruth, you lived for a while in a house that was quite an architectural jewel designed by Willis Polk at 1812 Washington Street. Would you describe the house briefly? RB: Well here is a picture of it. CE: I see, I see. RB: It’s a picture of the house. It's the Boerike home and we were all born and raised there. CE: Tell me, did the house survive the earthquake and fire of 1906? RB: Well, it was set for dynamiting, of course, but it was not done because the fire ended at Van Ness Avenue and it was on Washington between Van Ness and Franklin, so it was spared. CE: I understand, Ruth, that you went to a fashionable girl's school in San Francisco, Miss West's. RB: Miss West's, yes. CE: Where was that located?  RB: Van Ness Avenue and the corner of Pacific. It was private school, you know. CE: Was it similar to the Sarah Dix Hamlin School or perhaps it preceded it? RB: The Hamlin School was on Jackson, wasn't it? We went there for a little while but Mother had a little preference for this Miss West's School on Van Ness Avenue, so we went there but we were almost going to -- CE: And then you went east to Boston and what school did you attend there? RB: It was the Waltham New Church School. You see, we were all Swedenborgian. You see, Lyon's Street Church in San Francisco, the Church of the New Jerusalem. And we were all baptized, married, funerals, everything at that church, and still are. I'm the only one left in the family, and -- CE: And that church has been in San Francisco that long? RB: Well, not quite that long. No, it was built -- CE: But this Waltham School was run by the church? RB: It was a New Church School. CE: Was it a theological school or a finishing school? RB: Well, kind of both. I guess it really was. It was a theological school but also a finishing school. CE: Well, how did you happen to get to Briarcliffe Manor on the Hudson? RB: Well, my mother wanted us to go to society school. You can't call it a society school but where debutantes and all that where and I think my mother thought Waltham's was too much church connected with it. She kind of wanted us as prospective debutantes. CE: To be polished for matrimony. RB: Yes, at a New York finishing school, so that's how we happened to go there. CE: Tell me Ruth did you take a trip abroad after you graduated from school? RB: Well, we really never had a graduation, you see, because when we were at Waltham, it was just Waltham School and Briarcliffe was a finishing school. They didn't have a graduation in those days. I never will forget that Maud Wilson Sutton in San Francisco, the Sutton Family, her father wanted her to go to college but she was content with us and she was going to be a debutante, you know. So when her father said to her, “Maude I'd like to have you go to the University of California College.” And she said, “I don't want to go there.” And he said, “I will give you four hundred dollars if you'll go.” That was a lot of money in those days. And she said, “Mercy, Dad, do you think I'd accept four hundred dollars and not be a debutante?” That's how much it meant in those days you see. CE Well what year did you go abroad, Ruth? 1906 wasn't it? RB: Well we were in Dresden in 1906 for the fire and earthquake in San Francisco, we happen to be in Naples. In Naples, my father came over to bring my twin sister and me home and we were in Naples, and of course Mount Vesuvius was affected just like San Francisco being right under, you see. CE: So even though you were removed from your home you had an explosion there, the eruption of Vesuvius. RB: Well, it wasn't as bad as San Francisco but there was something that took place on Vesuvius. But the headlines of the Neapolitan paper, the paper that morning, the way we got the news was “San Francisco Wiped Off the Map.” CE: You must have been terrified.  RB: We certainly were. Mother and five brothers were in San Francisco. It took three days before we -- CE: You got the cable across and returned. RB: And it just so happened they had just moved to Mill Valley. CE: They weren't in the city that day? RB: No, but the house was set for dynamiting and everything. CE: Oh, dear. Well now let's get along with your life, Ruth. Where did you meet your future husband, Ralston Lowell White? RB: Well that was in Mill Valley. We -- CE: Did your family always have a home in Mill, Valley RB: Well yes, from 1904 on, a summer home in Mill Valley. CE: As well as your townhouse? RB: Yes, we spent summers there. CE: Where was your summer home located in Mill Valley? RB: At the junction of Tamalpais and Summit Avenue and Mr. Worcester, the minister of the Swedenborgian Church, was the one who chose the site. Father was his doctor and everything and Father told that he wasn't going to let his family go up to the Sierras anymore. We went up there for a while but then I think Father was nervous about having mother and five children up in the Sierras. CE: So far away. RB: Yes. So he decided and Mr. Worcester said, “I have just the place to tell you to go and I'll show you where to buy the place.” And that's how it was. Mr. Worcester who picked the site of our home in Mill Valley and so that's where we were. CE: So as a young girl you went over there, and then how did you come about you met Mr. White? RB: Oh, well, at the Blithdale Hop. CE: Oh, the Blithdale Hop. RB: My goodness they had it every Saturday night. CE: Dolly Jenkins told us about the Blithdale Hop. RB: Oh really? Have you interviewed her? CE: Yes we have, Ruth. So was he at one of the famous dances? RB: He certainly was. That was the great social event for all the Mill Valley young people. One night at the Blithdale Hop. And so I met Mr. White and he said to me, he said to me, let me see, how does that go? I didn't dance with him much because it was so busy, but anyway, he said to me, “Miss Boerike,” he said, “I'd like to take you to the Garden of Allah.” And I thought to myself, “This is so sudden. The only Garden of Allah I knew was in Africa.” But he said, “I will call you and take you to the Garden of Allah.” There was nothing for me to do but see what developed. In a few days he called up and said he wanted to see me and so he came and we walked from the Boerike home which was on Tamalpais and Summit, just a mile walk, and that avenue we walked along now is named after my husband, Ralston Avenue. CE: And you walked over to the Garden of Allah? RB: To the site of the Garden of Allah, there wasn't anything there, and Ralston took me up there and he looked up at Tamalpais and said, "This is my Garden of Allah" and he was reading Robert Hichen's book The Garden of Allah and loved the book. CE: I see.  RB: See? And when he looked up at Tamalpais and he thought about Robert Hichen's book he said he took a deep breath and said to himself, “This is my Garden of Allah.” That's how it got its name. That's how he took me there. And so when he died in 1943 and when I gave it to, as his memorial to the church, I wrote on the deed of trust, I said, the name must never be changed. CE: Well, after he showed you the property, then the normal events transpired and you were married? RB: Yes, that's right. CE: I understand you had an extraordinary honeymoon. RB: Well we had a very unusual one. The point was that we were married on April 6, 1910 and so we traveled the usual honeymoon way for months. We went to, you know, what's the name where the Coronado Hotel -- CE: San Diego. RB: San Diego and we went to Santa Barbara. We went to -- CE: All the conventional places. RB: Typical honeymoon. And then we got to Paso Robles after we had been married a month, why, we were both outdoor people and Ralston liked to ride, so we bought horses down there, and decided we would ride the rest of the way home, from Paso Robles along the Monterey Trail. Of course now it's a big highway, of course, but it was nothing but a trail and we rode along on horseback. And we invited, when we were going to ride home, we invited my twin sister and my brother Garth, my third brother, to come along and join us. They were really anxious to do so. There were really four of us that rode on horseback from Paso Roble to San Francisco. CE: Well that's a four hundred mile trip. RB: It took us about four weeks. CE: Four weeks. Where would you stay at night? RB: Camped. CE: You camped. Isn't that wonderful? RB: We took camping equipment and we all slept on the ground and cooked our meals. You know, we were all very young. CE: What a wonderful, wonderful experience. CE: The honeymoon, we were married in April, and before it was over it was the middle of June. CE: Would you describe Mr. White and give us a brief history of his background for us, Ruth? RB: Yes I can. Ralston White was born on August 27, 1877. He was ten years older than I. I was Ruth Boerike, Ruth Ellena Boerike and my twin sister and I were born on May 13, 1888. CE: Well where was your husband born? RB: He was born in San Francisco. CE: Where did he get -- Ruth, tell us about his parents. RB: Well his parents -- I think I read this - Ralston Lovell White was born August 27, 1887, San Francisco. CE: Don’t read it so quickly. RB: The only son of Lovell and Laura Lyon White, pioneer Californians. Coming to California in the fifties from Iowa. They settled in French Corral in the Sierras where Mr.  White ran a general merchandise store. After burying their three children, a boy and two girls, all under three years of age who died within three months of each other, from diphtheria, the Whites moved to San Francisco. Mr. White became immediately connected with banking and he remained in this field the rest of his life. He died January 30, 1910. He was Cashier and President of the San Francisco Saving Union for forty years until the time of his death. The San Francisco Saving Union later became the American Trust Company as it did unite with Wells Fargo Bank. After fourteen years since the death of their three children Mrs. White gave birth to their son Ralston Lovell White, this made him seem like an only son. The birth of this son gave untold happiness to Mr. and Mrs. White, who worshipped him. Ralston was born on the first anniversary of the day Mr. William C. Ralston, one of the founders of San Francisco, one might say, was drowned in San Francisco Bay. Mr. William C. Ralston was a close friend of Mr. Lovell White so he named his son after his great friend. The coincidence of his birth and the death of his great friend probably inspired this namesake thought. CE: How did Mr. White acquire that lovely acreage in Marin County at Mill Valley? RB: After he worked at the Bank in San Francisco for two years and earned the money, he couldn't continue that kind of career. CE: He didn't want to follow his father's career? RB: No, he did not. He wanted to be an out-of-doors person. So his father was really quite broken-hearted about it so Ralston took the eighteen-hundred dollars that he’d earned in the two years at the bank, and he went around the world and he was gone for two years. And he lived in Italy, that's where he learned Italian. And his first language was French, and his mother took him over as a baby. Then he arrived home. And then, having been separated from his mother and father for two years, they were so delighted that he came back that Mr. Lovell White was then reconciled to the fact that his son wouldn't be a banker and so then he became interested in becoming the owner of the Tamalpais Land and Water Company. Because, somewhere written down -- He worked over in Mill Valley and became the President of the Tamalpais Land and Water Company. The Tamalpais Land and Water Company was acquired through these gentlemen, early Marin Countyites, they bought the land from Throckmorton. CE: Oh yes, the Englishman. RB: Yes, the Englishman. They bought it from Throckmorton. And he had borrowed a thousand dollars from the bank and so they -- CE: Well that was Mr. White’s father's bank wasn't it? San Francisco Saving Union? RB: Yes, it was his bank. I don't know if he owned it all but it was his bank. CE: Well, they were interested in making a sub-division, then? RB: Yes. The minute they got the property from Throckmorton, then they immediately wanted to sub-divide and that was the beginning of the development of Mill Valley that ended up making Mill Valley. And they thought it was just going to be just a little village on the ground floor. But then after the big fire and the earthquake of San Francisco, why, Alice Eastwood, they became very interested in building on the sides of Marin County, you know, and they developed homes up on Magee and Summit Ave. and Tamalpais Avenue and then Mill Valley really began to grow. And that was in 1905, I think. But let me see, how it came -- CE: That’s ok, Ruth. After you had gone to this famous hop in Mill Valley and had met your future husband and he had shown you the land which he called the Garden of  Allah and you were married, and -- How did it come about that you acquired Willis Polk as the architect? And would you describe your home to us? RB: Oh well yes. CE: I want you to just describe it a little bit. What was the acreage it was sitting on? RB: It was sitting on -- Well, you see, the Tamalpais Land and Water Company owned all that area, right up to the Mountain Railroad track and right on down to almost to Homestead Valley, which used to be Mill Woods, you know, and they owned all that territory and so that was owned by the Tamalpais Land and Water Company. And so when Ralston took me up and showed me this Garden of Allah, you know, and said, “This is my Garden of Allah,” and everything, that's where we decided to build. CE: Well tell me what was the house like? Would you describe it? RB: Well it was steel and concrete. CE: Was that innovative for its time? RB: Very. It was the first, only steel and concrete house, I think, in Marin County. CE: How did you get all that material up the hill? RB: Well that came on the Mountain Railroad. The roads were too narrow in Mill Valley. They were just dirt roads for horse and buggy, you know, and everything. They couldn't possibly have done -- So Ralston, being the Vice President of the Mountain Railroad, the Crookedest Railroad in the World, why, it brought up all the material. And right above us, why, the train stopped and we had a slide that came down from the railroad track to our area and -- CE: All the material came down that way. RB: Yes, came down. It was very easy then to haul it down. CE: Was it an exciting project for you, Ruth? RB: Well,no. CE: The creation of this home? RB: Oh yes, that part was, but getting the train worker -- I have some wonderful pictures. CE: In your photograph album you have some wonderful shots of the house under construction and there's the leveled area which has been bulldozed off at the mountain and you have this slide coming down from the railroad. And here you have, which is certainly innovative for its day, steel construction three-stories high. Beautiful photographs. How long was the house under construction? RB: Oh, it took nearly two years. CE: Couple of years? RB: Yes about two years to build, because, you see, everything had to be brought up and it was quite a house to build, really. It was only intended to be a two story hose, that's all Mr. White and I -- We didn't have a family and we wanted to have a two story home but my dear husband, with all due respect to him, couldn't stand the heat, so when the house was being built he said to me, he said, “Ruthie, I could never be happy sleeping on this second floor unless we had an attic above us so that the second floor would be at a good temperature.” So that's how we happened to put on the attic. Well, as it turned out, it was a very good decision for the church because the church has now turned the attic of the Garden of Allah house into the men's dormitory and they keep sixty and eighty people overnight there, you see, now. The attic is for the men and the second floor is for the women, you know.  CE: Well perhaps now is as good a time to mention or to discuss what happened. Now I understand, Ruth, when Mr. White died in 1943 -- Tell us what you did to preserve the Garden of Allah in his memory. RB: Well the point was I had ten members living with me for ten years. You see, I was broken-hearted and my niece, Jean Barnard, was just married and she and Jack Barnard came and lived at the Garden of Allah. And Larry, he went to the war in the forties, but he lived with us until he went to the war and then I kept two children, members of the Swedenborgian Church, I kept them just to help out the family and all together it added up to there were nine of us living there, and the children helped with -- Of course those were still the depression days and so we didn't have any servants or help so I did the cooking for them all and the children helped with the dishes and we all did work together. And so we were together there until 1952 when I gave the Garden of Allah -- Then the children, Jean and Jeff, wanted to have their own home and Larry was going to get into -- He had been in the war and he had met this English bride over in England and so they wanted their home and so it was very apparent I wasn't going to have all the members living there anymore and I couldn't live there alone. So then I gave it to the California Academy of Sciences and they had it for about three years, two or three years and they loved it. The reason I selected that to give it to is because the California Academy of Sciences has a memorial for Ralston's father, Mr. Lovell White. His mother gave it to the California a memorial there, so I thought it would be very appropriate for the -- CE: The Academy of Sciences. Were they delighted with the bequest? RB: They certainly were delighted but regrettably their income was restricted to be spent in the City and County of San Francisco so they had to give it up painfully. They hated to give it up. Yes, so then I gave it to the United Church of Christ or the Northern Group of Congregation Church, whichever. But it's now own and operated by the United Church of Christ and the entrance to the Garden of Allah in Mill Valley -- The entrance as you turn in to the private property says, "Garden of Allah, The Ralston L. White Memorial Retreat, United Church of Christ." That's the entrance gate. CE: What a wonderful thing to do. RB: So and then the University of California, after I had given it and everything, called me up. They wanted to buy it. And they said, “Mrs. White, would you be interested in selling your Garden of Allah?” The California Academy of Sciences said they need a place near Berkeley but at the same time big enough and able to be a place where they can do a lot of outdoor something. And I said, “No, I made it my husband’s memorial.” And they said, “Oh, would you refuse four-hundred-thousand dollars?” which of course was a lot of money then. And I said, “I certainly would refuse, it's a memorial to my dear husband and it will ever remain there.” So of course that was the end of that, I never was offered again anything. CE: Would you tell us again Ruth, this is the Swedenborgian Church? RB: No, no, they didn't offer, this was the California Academy of Sciences. CE: No, no, no, dear, the church you gave -- RB: Oh, the United Church of Christ? Oh no. CE: Had nothing to do with that? RB: Oh no, no, because, you see, that's the reason the Church couldn't maintain it in any way. I would have loved to have given it but they couldn't do anything. They didn't have enough money to do it.  CE: Do they use it as a teaching place or a retreat? RB: They use it for everything. CE: Use it for everything. RB: Weddings, they have so many weddings there now. CE: How many people can it accommodate? RB: Well they keep sixty people. CE: Sixty people? RB: But of course the way they do it is, they have bed after bed, you know. CE: Dormitories. RB: Yes, dormitories, yes, exactly. And the men have all kinds of bed up in the attic. CE: Do you remember some particular gala events that were at the Garden of Allah? RB: Well, the wedding. CE: When you were there? RB: Well, my niece, my twin sister's daughter, Jean Barnard, was married there. CE: That was a gala event. RB: There were four-hundred guests, four-hundred guests. CE: How did you get them there? How did they come? RB: Well they came up the roads, they were wide enough, and the automobile in those days went up and down, so they came up, there were four hundred guests. CE: And I imagine you had an orchestra? RB: Oh I'm sure we did. CE: Regular reception? RB: Yes. CE: Was Christmas a gala time at the home? RB: Well family time. CE: Yes. RB: That was always confined. My father and mother were great on family, Christmas gatherings. CE: Did your husband have to entertain a great deal in regards with his work? Were you in a position to be a hostess often? RB: Well, he was such an outdoor person that he had a baseball field up above the Garden of Allah, a full-size baseball diamond, and he had constantly over the Rotarians and the two or three different groups, all for baseball. And then I used to entertain them afterwards, not a full meal, but, you know, refreshments and things like that. CE: Did you have a staff helping you? RB: Well we always had just two servants: a cook and a second maid. But if we entertained big groups we'd always get an extra one to come up from Mill Valley for the occasion, you know, an extra maid or something. CE: Did you ever have any outdoor affairs, like at the Fourth of July, or barbecues? RB: Oh, yes, yes we had barbecues. We had a swimming pool that held three-hundred and fifty-thousand gallons of water and I swam in it for fifty years and it was never heated. It was sixteen feet deep and ice cold water, it never was warmer than -- End, Side A CE: Tell me Ruth, did you have a swimming pool at your property?  RB: We certainly did. The creek came down from Tamalpais and Mr. White and I were very fond of swimming and so we dammed the canyon up and they had a big dam and the pool held three-hundred and fifty-thousand gallons of water and had two diving boards and a bridge across which my husband decided to have taken down because he felt that when they went off these diving platforms up high and the bridge connecting, he thought they might hit their head on the dam, you know, and he didn't want to take that chance. So he took the bridge down. I have a picture of it in the album. But the two diving platforms were left and the people dove off of them and everything. CE: RB: CE: RB: feet CE: RB: swam for nine months, from April to the first of December, then we emptied the pool because the rains were very heavy, not like this year. The rains were very heavy so we got the water out and it was just a creek going through the - - Was the pool heated? Oh certainly not, never. How deep was it? It was sixteen-feet deep at the deepest part and then it went on up to about five- at the further end.. Did you use it often? I swam for fifty years in it and Mr. White and I went in I think everyday. We CE: Well it certainly kept you in marvelous physical condition - RB: It certainly did. CE: Looking around your home today I see on the terrace you have a stationary bicycle. RB: Oh yes, yes. I've gone eleven thousand miles on it, but Dr. Bowie did a thousand before he died. That's where I do all my reading, when I'm bicycling I'm reading and when I'm climbing the Bret Harte Boulevard I take my transistor and listen to the news. I have to do two things at once, absolutely. CE: You've got too much going on, Ruth. Well now, tell me, I understand there was a period where you lived abroad, about 1929 to 1939 during the depression. RB: It was 1933 until 1940, I think it was, it was seven and a half years. CE: Well where did you go? RB: We lived in Munich. And you see, Mr. White, when the crash or 1929 came, you see, Ralston had to put all he owned -- He was president to the Tamalpais Land and Water Company and had large tracts of land all over and he had to pay taxes on it but he couldn't sell anything because there was a big depression. So he had everything going out and nothing coming in and so there was nothing for us to do but to rent the Garden of Allah, leave our Finnish gardener there, Alfonse Hopper, who took care of it for forty - five years, to leave him there and rent the Garden of Allah and for us to live in Europe on a dollar a day each where we lived for seven and a half years in Munich. And we bicycled five thousand miles all through Europe, you see, that's the only means of transportation we had besides walking. And we went all over. We went to the coronation of Edward VI in England and we went to Scotland and Wales. We went through Austria, Italy. We couldn't get into Spain because something was tied up in some way but we went all through France and Italy and of course we spoke three languages because Ralston spoke perfectly French and Italian, and I spoke German because my father and I used to read German, my father having been born in Austria. But of course Ralston learned German too, he was a natural linguist. But I never learned -- Well I knew a little  French but I didn't know any Italian, but with our three languages we could bicycle a thousand miles and whenever we wanted to stop at night we'd ring a doorbell and say, you know, “May we spend the night? We will pay you for it and everything.” We never had any trouble because we spoke the languages, you see. CE: Do you recall, Ruth, who rented your home in Mill Valley? RB: The first people -- CE: Who had the money to rent such a lovely place? RB: I know, well, the rent, it was very, very minor. The first people who rented were the Priests, Mr. and Mrs. Priest in Mill Valley. But they didn't stay long, they found it difficult transportation, so they gave it up. Then it was rented to -- But the renting never lasted. Most of the time the house was just used for certain occasions but it wasn't – CE: Wasn't really lived in. RB: No it really was not, so it was really a great loss, you see, and that's the reason - poor Ralston, he paid off every dollar and he died. He paid off his last -- He had a heart attack March 1943 and I though he was doing very well and all of a sudden he had a thrombosis. Is that what they call it, thrombosis? And that was September and it occurred on a Wednesday, I think it was, and I took him over to the Marin hospital. He lived only two days and then he died the 26 of September, 1943, but he was only over at the Marin Hospital a couple of days cause he was getting along pretty well after his first heat attack in March. CE: Well, when did you came back from Europe about 1939, did you say? RB: Or 1940. Yes. CE: Just before our involvement in the war. RB: Yes. CE: I understand you became involved in some World War II war efforts, the Interceptor Command? RB: Oh the Interceptor Command, yes. But I sent a hundred -- Oh that was in the First World War, a hundred thousand dollars to the fatherless children of France. CE: Well we should go back to World War I. We've been so busy talking about your husband but I understand that you've been always involved in charitable things, Ruth, and in World War I is it rue that you raised a hundred thousand dollars for French widows and orphanage? RB: Fatherless Children of France Organization. CE: How did that come about? Where did you do the work, here or did you go abroad? RB: No I did the work around here. I wasn't always actually raising money. I did a lot of work for the organization in different ways and Mr. Brunswick, who is a native San Franciscan, he was so impressed that I was responsible for a hundred-thousand dollars being sent over, why, when he went to France he negotiated with somebody over there so that they sent me a medal and as very wonderful letter from the French Government thanking me for my work. CE: That's wonderful. And then, always you've been involved. I understand you have been active in the Junior League of San Francisco. RB: That's right, the Junior League and also the -- CE: You've been involved teaching at Sunny Hills when it was an orphanage? RB: Yes, that's right.  CE: How did you get interested in that? RB: Well I don't know. CE: Because you were living in Marin at that time. RB: In Mill Valley, yes. Oh I went up there regularly and taught up there. CE: What would you teach? RB: Well I think it was just children, I think it was grammar school. Of course, I never was paid. CE: A credited teacher? RB: No, I never was, no. CE: Are there other organizations that you became interested in when you were living in Marin? How about the Marin Music Chest? RB: Well, I think I did work for that too. It's hard for me to remember, I was always busy at some sort of charity work. CE: And of course your church work. RB: Yes, oh yes, my church work. Well I did a lot of work for the United Church of Christ. CE: Yes. RB: Oh, I did some other work on Marin County. I don't know what it is now, but anyway, it was -- CE: You made the contribution in World War I by raising money for the French widows, then World War II comes along and you want to do something again. RB: Yes. CE: How did you get in that Interceptor Command? Was that a command located in the Stock Exchange Building in San Francisco on Sansome and Montgomery? RB: Montgomery and California, I think it was. Well I don't know how I got -- CE: As I recall, I did some time there, too, you went on this mezzanine and they had this huge plotting board and you sat around and all of the planes and ships coming in prior to December the 1st, 1941, all were plotted on this board. What hours did you work there? RB: Oh well, I don't remember. CE: Don't remember. Well that was a valuable contribution you did. RB: Well whatever the normal amount of hours were expected I did, but I can't remember exactly. CE: Well now tell me, after, you said your husband died in 1943, and you were a widow for ten or eleven years. RB: Eleven years. CE: What did you do then? Did you stay on -- RB: Oh that's when I lived at the Garden of Allah and I had all the family and these two church members and I was the cook for them all and the children helped with the dishwashing. We all lived there and did gardening and everything and I did a lot of charitable work then too but I can't remember exactly what it was but I was awfully busy, of course, mostly house work because it was such a big family. CE: Pretty soon you met and married another gentleman, Doctor Robert C. Bowie. How did that come about? RB: Well that came about because my homeopathic doctor -- Oh I was walking in the Alps. I went over and walked in the Alps and invited my fourteen-year-old little nephew  to come over and join me and walk and he was delighted to do it and he came over and we were walking in the Alps. And by the way my nephew Steven Buck, he fell in love with Europe and so he became a -- He is a, now what is he? CE: Is he a citizen of another country? RB: Oh no, no, he isn't a citizen but he did his work in Beirut and in Africa. He was there a long time because he fell in love. He was doing his life work over there. CE: What was his life work? RB: It was connected with -- He was in Beirut. CE: Was it music? RB: No it wasn't music, it was land, I think connected with land development. CE: Anyway, you were over there in Switzerland, in the Alps. RB: Yes, and my brother wrote me and said, “Ruthie, why don't you come back from Switzerland and join us and fly to Rio de Janeiro where the World Congress of Homeopathy is going to take place?” And my brother Charlie and his wife were going, my twin sister and her husband were going but they weren't doctors. And Doctor Schmid -- Oh no that was the next time I went with Doctor Schmid. But anyway I came home, Stephen Buck, my fourteen-year-old nephew, he had to go to high school, so I brought him to New York and to his home in Scarsdale. He lived in Scarsdale, New York. And then I joined Charlie, my brother, and his wife, and my sister and we flew to Rio de Janeiro. CE: Well had any of your brothers followed your father's profession? RB: Two doctors. CE: Two. RB: Two homeopathic doctors: Doctor Garth Boerike, he settled in Philadelphia and Doctor Charles Boerike in the East Bay. CE: So you went down to this convention in Rio. RB: In Rio de Janeiro and it was a doctors' convention. My twin sister and her husband were there and he wasn’t a doctor, so my twin sister and her husband and I, we stayed at -- We all stayed at the Gloria Hotel. And we just were having a good time down there while the doctors' convention took place because we weren't doctors, you see. And then -- But one time I was talking to a doctor at the Gloria Hotel and he looked up and said, “Oh Mrs. White!” Of course, I was Mrs. White then. And he said, “Oh, Mrs. White,” he said, “here comes a Doctor Bowie from Colorado. You must meet him. And he's a very delightful person.” So he walked towards us, you see, and then I thought to myself, “Why, he is quite jaunty,” but I didn't say it, you know, but he was walking quite briskly. Both my husbands were ten years older than I. So Doctor Bowie came along and I was introduced to him and so we had a little talk and then I didn't anything more of him, he was a busy doctor down there and I didn't know that I had made an impression on him whatever. But he left a day earlier than I did, from Rio de Janeiro, and when he came up and said goodbye to me he said “Goodbye, Mrs. White.” He said, “It's been very nice meeting you. Will you write to me?" and I was bowled over when he said that because I had hardly seen him or known him or anything. And I said "Well I'll be glad to send you a California Christmas card." I said, “I live in California, San Francisco. I'll send you a Christmas card." But that didn't do. When he got back to Colorado he started writing to me, you see, to Mill Valley. He wrote and wrote. And finally at Christmastime I sent him a Christmas card, he came out in person. That's when we became engaged and we were  married in April '55. He came out and became engaged to me and then he went back to Colorado, of course because he was a busy doctor. And then came out and we were married in San Francisco at the Swedenborgian Church in April 3, '55. And Ralston White and I were married at the Swedenborgian Church April 6, 1910, so both my marriages were at the Swedenborgian Church. CE: Tell us a little bit about that church. RB: Oh it's the second in the United States for weddings. CE: What's the first one? RB: Oh, the Little Church Around the Corner in New York City. It has more weddings than the Swedenborgian Church. The Church of the New Jerusalem on Lyons Street between Washington and Jefferson, it's the second in the United States for -- CE: Why do you think it's so popular, in your opinion? RB: Well because it's so beautiful. Have you never been to it? CE: Yes, I have been there. RB: It has that lovely open fireplace and four Keith pictures, you know, spring, summer, autumn, winter. And then the lovely pulpit there and the stained glass windows and then -- CE: It's a beautiful place. RB: It has a little narrow window up where the caller takes place and that little narrow window came from England, from the -- Oh I can't think of it, that famous church, the one in England. CE: Canterbury? Westminster? RB: Oh I can't remember, but anyway it came from a famous church in England. It's just a little narrow strip and was sent to Worcester when he was minister there, you know. So they're very proud of that little narrow church there, a window there with colored glass. CE: Well tell me Ruth, when Doctor Bowie came out and you were married, did you go back with him and live in Colorado or did you -- RB: We lived the summers in Colorado and the winters in the Garden of Allah. You see I had given the Garden of Allah then to as my first husband’s memorial but I always kept a tiny little corner and I still have that, because -- CE: Sort of your own apartment or suite? RB: Well it's got a bedroom and then we added a little addition so Larry, my nephew, has his desk there and it's fixed up so that I can entertain there, offering tea or wine or something. Don't forget the wine there. CE: Yes, we shall have it shortly. RB: Yes, so I entertain there every now and then. And Doctor Schimdt, my homeopathic doctor in San Francisco, he loves to come over to the Garden of Allah and walk all over the hills and then he comes to my little corner there. I give him something to eat and drink and he brings his wife and three children so I do quite a little bit of entertaining there. CE: Would you be good enough to tell us -- RB: Pardon me, I just want to say that this little corner place that I have is only mine while I’m alive. Then when I die it belongs to the United Church of Christ. CE: Would you tell us -- Sometimes perhaps you would be good enough to take Mrs. Kent and me over to see it.  RB: Oh I'd be delighted anytime. Just give me a little notice. Anytime to the church service if you'd like to go. CE: Yes. RB: Or I could go during the week too, but it's nice to go to the church service, then they always serve coffee and cookies and things in the parish room. CE: Do you happen to know the road it's located on now? RB: Oh it's on Lyons Street. It's on Lyons Street in San Francisco. CE: No, no, dear, the Garden of Allah. Is it on the street? Does it have a street name? RB: It's called Bayview Avenue. I can look it up in the telephone book. CE: That's alright. RB: See, there are three streets in Mill Valley named after the White family. Ralston Avenue is named after my first husband, Lovell Avenue is named after his father, Lovell White, and Lyon Place is named after his mother, she was Laura Lyon. So there are three streets named after the White family. CE: Could you explain simply what a homeopathic doctor is? RB: Oh my goodness just don't get me started on that. I don't dare open my mouth here because there's nothing but allopathic doctors here. CE: Well you could tell us simply? A lot of people don't know what that is. RB: Well in the first place a homeopathic doctor does not become a doctor until he has studied three years longer than allopathic doctors. It's that much more difficult. A homeopathic doctor treats the patient, not the disease. And a homeopathic doctor always knows that nature does eighty-percent of the work and after the homeopathic doctor has treated the individual, the patient, not the disease and let nature do eighty percent of the work, then the homeopathic doctor asks you every possible symptom that you have, and then he knows how to treat you. And the same disease treated by a homeopathic doctor might be different medicine given to different people because he asks the individual everything, and then he knows what medicine belongs to that group of symptoms. It's very marvelous. Oh goodness sake, look at me at 87 years old. CE: RB: I've -- CE: RB: We all did that, the Boerike Family. We all climbed up on top of Tamalpais. And I played tennis at the Garden of Allah. We had a wonderful tennis court, and Helen Willis played there and Tilden played there. It was the only two tennis courts in Mill Valley. They were full size. One was at the Garden of Allah and the other was the Billings Court down in Blithdale Canyon. The Billings had a full size. But only two tennis courts in Mill Valley that were full size. So Helen Wills and they all wanted to, they all wanted to play. CE: Well I think today -- You say you're 88? RB: I'm 87. I'll be 88 on the 13th of May. CE: But didn't you tell us earlier that you walked from your residence here at the Tamalpais across up that steep hill in Greenbrae and back? RB: Oh yes, of course. I go to the top of the Bret Harte Boulevard. CE: Well what's that distance? RB: It's about two miles. Well I marvel at your physique. Well sure. I've never taken a sleeping pill in my life. I've never taken anything and You've walked all your life. All my life, ridden horseback, went swimming, climbed Tamalpais twenty times.  CE: Each way? RB: To go up to the top of the Bret Harte Boulevard, but then I turn right or left. If I turn right I come down 101 Highway, or if I turn left I come down Julian Hill. What's the name of it? AK: Wolfe Grade. RB: Wolfe Grade, yes that's where I come down. CE: Do you do that often? RB: Well three or four times a week. Of course over the holidays I'm too busy, so may extras and parties and programs, but now I'm getting back to normal. CE: Do you have a particular diet? RB: Oh, nothing. I pay no attention to food. I'm so sick of people talking about food, I go nuts. They absolutely -- They follow their diets: “Oh, I can’t eat this. I don't eat that.” Because they go to these allopathic doctors and the doctors give them these diets and everything. And I always say, sure, allopathic cures you quickly, they give you those strong pills and medicines and it cures you quickly but it builds up future trouble and that's the reason so many of you now, at the Tamalpais, they can hardly walk. CE: Well do you enjoy food? Do you enjoy eating? RB: Oh I enjoy it very much but I skip meals. CE: You skip meals? RB: Oh, all the time because I don't want to put on weight. See this morning I weighed 118 and I don't want to gain weight. So if I go to my scale -- I'll show you my scale. And I get on every morning and if I go up a half a pound or anything, then I skip a meal. But it makes me a little light-headed because now I'm too old to skip meals and my homeopathic doctor, Doctor Schmidt, in San Francisco, he really forbid me to do it but I disobey him because I'm the daughter of a doctor, the sister of two doctors, and the widow of a doctor, so I feel I can be my own boss. See, I want to give you something to drink here. CE: Well thank you so much, Ruth. This has been a delightful afternoon. This concludes our interview with Ruth Boerike White Bowie. And this is Carla Ehat of the Moya Library Guild.
MarinCounty;Virginia Borland;CE: Today is Tuesday, January 30, 1979. Continuing the Oral History Project of the Marin County Library at Civic Center, this is Carla Ehat. Today, we have the extreme pleasure of interviewing Virginia Borland. She resides at number 54 Fremont Road in San Rafael, California. Miss Borland is the daughter of Robert Henry Hewitt Borland, a distinguished San Francisco attorney, and Anna Mason Borland. She and her family have owned property in Marin County since 1924 and she has been a permanent resident since 1932. She was educated at Stanford University where she received her AB in 1937. Miss Borland received her Masters in Library Science at the University of California, Berkeley in 1968. She has been associated with the Marin County Library since 1961 and, until her retirement in June of 1978, was the Branch Librarian at the Civic Center. In this capacity, she fought long and hard to preserve and enlarge the California Room and only last year, in January 1978, wrote and successfully pushed through a resolution before the Board of Supervisors making the California Room in perpetuity. She made the library come alive with programs and outstanding exhibits and created the Oral History Project for the County. To learn more of this extraordinary woman and her achievements, let us turn to her today. Good afternoon, Virginia. VB: Good afternoon, Carla.           CE: Well, Virginia, you have a very interesting lineage, and let’s start with your maternal side of the family. Now, as I understand, your maternal great grandfather was Dr. Edgar Mason. Is that correct? VB: Yes, that is correct. CE: Tell us what brought him to California. Tell us the story. VB: Well, first, just a minute, because Mrs. Kent asked me to go back as far as I could. My family tree begins in the year 699 with first fourteen Kings of Denmark, from Gorman the First through Harold the Fifth. And then my ancestors went to Normandie where they were Dukes of Guignes, G-U-I-G-N-E-S, and then they went with William the Conqueror and fought the Battle of Hastings. And then William LaBlount, B-L-O-U-N-T, was Master of Horse to the King and they stayed in England and had estates, but when King Charles was beheaded, so many royalists went to France, but they came to this country. My great, great, great grandfather was the first Governor of Tennessee, and – CE: What was his name, Virginia? VB: William Blount. And his son, Richard Blount, married Catherine Minor, and their daughter, Eliza Blount, married Edgar Mason, Dr. Edgar Mason, yes, and he was born in Tarrytown-on-Hudson. CE: Do you know the year? VB: No, I would have to look that up. Then he came west as physician to a wagon train, bringing his wife and four small children and her lady’s maid to dress her hair on the way across the plains. So they settled in Marysville, but there was a terrible flood and they had to go out the hotel window, upstairs window, in a boat. CE: Tell me, Virginia, did you learn which route they took in coming to California? VB: I’m sure they came from St. Joe, Missouri and then across the plains to Northern California. CE: Did they come in through Carson Pass, or did they come in through Truckee? Do you know? VB: I don’t know. So then they moved from Marysville to Crescent City where Dr. Edgar Mason was the first physician and also the first County Judge. His son, Alonzo Mason, then married my grandmother. Oh, my grandfather was born on December 30, 1855 in Crescent City. CE: Well, tell me, Virginia, I understood it was your great grandfather, Dr. Edgar Mason, who gave to Crescent City two blocks of land, which they use for its plaza, and also gave for a schoolhouse the land on which its civic center now stands? Is that the same gentleman? VB: Yes, that’s correct and he also gave them the land for the Masonic Temple. My grandmother, who was born in 1859, she came across the Isthmus of Panama on a donkey. CE: Is this Mary Elizabeth Keegan? VB: Yes that’s right. And came up the coast then to Crescent City where her mother had a sister. CE: Tell me, did either of your grandparents keep a journal or are there any letters or ephemera relative to this? VB: No, I think not, but they both talked all the time so I have a lot of oral history recollections.  CE: But not on tape? VB: No, recollections. Her mother, my grandmother’s mother, was ill and so she died and my grandmother was brought up by her mother’s sister. Then she went to the Normal School, I guess when she was about nineteen. My grandfather went to Heald’s Business College and they settled in San Francisco, and they always had – I think they were on Telegraph Hill in the beginning because they always wanted a view of the bay, and – CE: Do you have any idea when your grandfather came to San Francisco? VB: Yes, in 1876. CE: 1876, 100 years ago. VB: And then he married my grandmother, who was then teaching school in Crescent City, and – Incidentally, my great-grandfather had property in San Francisco which he let go for taxes because it was just all sand. So anyway, we came over here – CE: Well, wait a minute, before you get here, we’ve got to get you and your father and mother together. First of all, Alonzo Mason and Mary Elizabeth Keegan Mason’s daughter was your mother, is that correct? VB: Mary Elizabeth Keegan was my grandmother. Anna Mason Borland was my mother. CE: Yes, I mean your mother was their daughter. VB: Yes. CE: Alright. Was she born in San Francisco? VB: She was born in San Francisco. CE: Tell us a little bit about your mother. VB: Well, she studied painting and she studied music for six years – CE: In San Francisco? VB: In San Francisco. And she studied elocution, public speaking, drama, all from the woman who was the mother of one of the two outstanding trial lawyers in San Francisco now. She coached plays and taught drama before she was married. CE: I gather she might have been interested in genealogy. Is that correct? VB: Yes, she was. CE: And you seem to carry on that same interest. VB: Yes, I do. CE: Tell us, how did she meet your father? VB: Well, she met my father at a house party at Half Moon Bay. It was a benefit for some Portuguese and she went with Willa Gilbert and my father went with a friend of his, and so they met there. She said his voice just went right through her. CE: I think you should start now and tell us a little bit about your father and the Canadian side of your family. VB: Yes, my father was born in Centerton, Ontario, Canada in a big farm house and he went to school and he saved a little boy’s life by – A little boy fell in the river and my father went, ran down to the bridge and caught him and pulled him out. The mother kept the village store and she told Bobby he could have anything he wanted, so he took a pencil box. And the little boy whose life he had saved stole it back from him.  CE: There’s a moral in here somewhere. I want to backtrack just a moment to your mother. I don’t think you said where she was from. Was she from the south, Virginia, your mother? VB: Well she was born in San Francisco but yes, my family is from the south. I’m named for the state of Virginia. CE: Oh her family were from the south? VB: Yes, my grandfather’s. CE: Whereabouts? Do you know? VB: Well, they came – William Blount, another William Blount, came in 1642 and there weren’t very many people there, so probably – CE: Do you have any relatives that you know of still in the south? VB: No. CE: Alright, let’s get back to your father. VB: Alright. So his father taught school and preached and he got – Well I guess he got tuberculosis. He was out playing with the boys in the very cold weather and so the doctor said he should come to California for his health. CE: So that’s what brought the Borlands here? VB: Yes. CE: I VB: CE: VB: CE: VB: CE: VB: CE: VB: CE: VB: CE: VB: CE: VB: CE: see. So then his father went to San Bernardino where the climate was very hot. Did he improve down there? Yes, he lived to be eighty-two. So then later, he brought his family up to San Bernardino. He became a citizen? Yes, he did. And in the 1890s, I presume, the wife and children then automatically became citizens? Yes, they came. My mother was born in 1886. My father was born in 1884, October the eleventh. She was born March 26, 1886. Did your father go to the local schools in San Francisco, or had he – No, he was in San Bernardino, and then he went to Stanford. What made that decision of your father to go to Stanford? Well he always wanted to be a lawyer, even before he knew what a lawyer was, so he came north. Tell me, Virginia, before we continue with your father at Stanford, getting back to your mother for just a moment more, she was a member of the DAR, wasn’t she? Yes, she was a member of the Daughters of the American Revolution and she was a regent. Did some of her family fight in the Civil War? She belonged to the Daughters of the Confederacy, the Jefferson Davis Chapter, and was an officer, but wouldn’t take the presidency because she thought two other people should have it before she did and the nominating committee said they’d never get it. Well then, she wouldn’t take it. Yes, my mother was very active in the Daughters of the Confederacy, Jefferson Davis Chapter. I was the President of the Children of the Confederacy when I was six-years-old. Would you tell us briefly what that means?  VB: Well, I knew parliamentary law better than most adults know it now, and I presided at the meetings, and that’s where I knew, well, a great many women – CE: You mean your mother’s age? VB: Mrs. Joseph LeConte came to my meetings and she was always very nice. CE: What would you discuss at these meetings? History? VB: Well, we discussed whatever was going on. The Mother Chapter, the adult chapter, did work at Caney Creek, sent clothes and books and that to Caney Creek. CE: It was a service organization? VB: It was a service organization, yes. And I have a picture that shows me placing a wreath on George Washington’s statue. And there was another veteran that’s when I was six-years-old – there was a veteran of the Grand Army of the Republic standing there, too, and also a man from the Spanish War. CE: Where did this take place? Do you know? VB: Well it’s in the – Now it’s in the Grand Opera House or the one next door. CE: The Veterans’ Memorial Building? VB: The Veterans’ Memorial Building, yes. CE: Well that’s very interesting. Alright, let’s get back to your father. He wanted to become a lawyer. VB: Yes. CE: Why did he select Stanford? VB: Well, because it was the best college, university, on the west coast. CE: And the law department excelled Berkeley? VB: Excelled, yes. CE: And any other universities in the area? VB: Yes. CE: VB: CE: VB: In CE: VB: Alright then, what happened? Well, I should say that my mother and father were married at the Century Club in San Francisco. Shortly after he graduated, or when? 1914. 1914. Now is that the same Century Club located on Franklin and Sutter today in San Francisco? Yes, same one, yes. And he had worked during the fire and earthquake out at the Alta Plaza Park, doing relief work, you know, and my mother was not too far away, on Vallejo Street, but they didn’t meet until later when they met at this house party. Then what did he do, go to work for a group of lawyers initially? Yes, he went to work for Harding and Monroe, who were very good lawyers. CE: VB: CE: General law? VB: Yes, general law. And he was paid thirty-five dollars a month. CE: Good wages for those times. VB: For the time. CE: What form of law did your father enjoy the most? What did he finally – VB: Well, what he enjoyed the most was his work for Donaldina Cameron.  CE: We must get that story in. First of all, tell – For the record, tell us a little bit about Donaldina Cameron, who she was and , what she did in Chinatown. VB: Well she lived on a ranch with her father and her sisters and her brother and she was a great horseback rider, and – Said Santiago, which evidently was a kind of a war crime because they went right off – And then she came for one year to 920 Sacramento Street because Miss Culbertson, who was the leader or superintendent there – CE: Well, what motivated Donaldina Cameron to leave this cloistered home down in the valley and seek this sort of social work? Have you any knowledge of that? VB: Mrs. Philip Brown begged her to come just for one year. CE: Had she known this girl? VB: Well, Mrs. Brown did, but Miss Culbertson didn’t. And so she went and – Look at the deer! CE: Oh yes. We’re sitting at a window in Mrs. Kent’s living room, looking up towards Mount Tam, and it’s raining gently and some deer have just walked across the lawn. It’s a beautiful sight. VB: Surely is a lovely sight. So then she went for one year and then – CE: Well, tell us for the record what that 920 Sacramento Street place was. What did it do? VB: Well they saved, rescued, slave girls who had been brought into the country presumably to marry Chinese husbands, but they were instead brought in to houses of ill fame and sold. And some of them would get prices of $3,000. CE: It was a terrible struggle for them, but she finally won the respect of the San Francisco Police force, did she not? VB: She certainly did. CE: And gained a great deal of co-operation, and what part did your father play in assisting her? VB: Well, he went into court and defended her. And he also – When the girls were stolen – Now Miss Cameron was running 920 – CE: Miss Culbertson was discharged. VB: Yes, and now it was Cameron House. So if they were stolen away, my father phoned district attorneys and various places and had them brought up and they were made wards, not of the court, but of Miss Cameron’s. CB: Did she assume the total responsibility and care? VB: Total responsibility and care, yes. And she dressed their wounds, which were sometimes syphilitic, and she never caught anything. She was just a truly great woman. CE: Well, I know that recently a biography was published, and you very graciously gave Mrs. Kent and me a copy: Chinatown’s Angry Angel: The Story of Donaldina MacKenzie Cameron by Mildred Crowl Martin. VB: Yes. CE: Is this in your judgment a fairly definitive – VB: Yes, I think this is a very good book. I recommend it to anybody. CE: I wonder what got your father interested in this. Had he ever heard of the woman?  VB: Well, yes. Henry Monroe had been her lawyer and then when my father came into the office he took over – CE: Her account. “Here’s the folder of a woman I think you can handle.” VB: Yes. “And there’s no money attached to it, so –” CE: I understand your father did this for so many years with no remuneration. VB: That’s right, yes. CE: Had you had the pleasure of meeting this woman? VB: Oh yes, I knew her all my life and she gave me this ring when I was born. CE: When you were born. Would you describe her to us? VB: Well, she was a beautiful, beautiful woman and when I knew her, her hair was white but very becomingly dressed. She usually wore, at least when she was at 920 Sacramento Street, she wore Chinese brocaded dresses. She was gentle but oh so determined, she went across the rooftops and dropped down with Sergeant Langen who was head of the Chinatown squad. And I guess sometimes my father would be there, and these highbinders would be sitting deciding the girl’s fate and she would just take her by the arm and walk away with her and take her back to the home. CE: She lived a long life, too, didn’t she? VB: Yes, she lived to be ninety-eight. Until 1968. I talked to her every week and I went down about twice a year to see her. CE: You talked to her every week on the phone? VB: Yes. CE: You mean when you were going to school, even at Stanford? VB: Well, all the time. She came to my graduation and gave me a jade pendant from Shreve’s. CE: What did she give you intangibly that has stayed with you all your life? VB: Oh, loyalty and courage and I’m sure many other things. CE: She was an inspirational person. VB: Yes, she was, and I still miss her. CE: Has she been gone for some time, Virginia? VB: Just around Christmas, 1968. CE: I notice in your own home, you have a lot of Chinese furniture and artifacts. Is this influence the result of your many years’ association with Miss Cameron? VB: Yes. Well there’s a vase that, I think, is Ming, which she gave us one Christmas, and then there’s the Chinese rug that my father bought from B.S. Fong who was the president of the Six Companies and he bought the two Chinese lions in Chinatown. CE: Well, there must have been some Chinese who were established in Chinatown who were supportive of her action. VB: Oh absolutely, and there were many of her girls who were married from 920. So she not only saved them and protected them but she got them husbands. CE: Very good. Well, Virginia, we’ve got to start with you, now. When were you born? VB: I was born October 6, 1916. CE: In San Francisco? VB: In San Francisco.  CE: Where was your family home then? VB: It was on Vallejo Street. CE: What was the address on Vallejo? VB: 1962. CE: That would be near – VB: Between Fillmore and Steiner. CE: Did you attend the local public school? VB: Yes, I went to Pacific Heights School where my mother had gone before me, although it was a different place. Same school. CE: And then where did you go? VB: And then I went to Galileo High School because they had the only telescope. They had a refractor and a reflector. CE: And you were interested in astronomy? VB: In astronomy, yes. CE: Well, in those days, as your contemporaries, it seems to me you could go to the high school of your choice if they had academic subjects you could – VB: It was a good high school and it was my area as much as anything. And Dr. Norris, Joseph P. Norris, was the principal. One of his brothers was a judge and one was a newspaperman. CE: Well, I know I’m jumping ahead a bit, but I know one of your main interests in life has been horseback riding. Did it start at that early age with you? VB: Five years old. At six o’clock in the morning, my father and I rode along the beach. Sunday morning at six o’clock in the morning. CE: Where did you keep the horse, out at the park? VB: Yes, we rented the horses. CE: At the park? VB: No at the beach. CE: At the beach VB: And then later in high school, I rode on horses from the park, but then I rode over here. In Larkspur, there was a lumber yard and there were also stables and I rode on horses down there when we came over. CE: First, let’s finish your education. You also had this desire to go to Stanford. Was that prompted by your father? VB: Yes, I’m sure it was. CE: And you wanted to emulate that? VB: That’s right. CE: What were you interested in pursuing during those Stanford years? What was your major? VB: My major was history. CE: And I know you cultivated a great interest in Greece and its culture. VB: Yes and then I did graduate work in archeology and Greek and in the Classics. That’s one department. But I had always been interested in Greece and I had slept with a thick book whose cover had a picture of Pegasus on it under my pillow. CE: Was it always your dream to go to Greece? VB: Well I think from the time I was in Galileo. I had a very good teacher who had good bibliographies that were really college bibliographies, because I read the  Sea Kings of Crete then and that was also on college book lists. So then my first quarter at Stanford, and it was very hard to get in then for women, only four students out of Galileo were admitted. And there was an introduction to Greek archeology given and I took that. I was fascinated by it. And I was very impressed by the professor. CE: Was that the woman? VB: Yes. CE: What was her name? VB: Dr. Hazel Dorothy Hansen and she went to Greece every – CE: She was almost an equal to Edith Hamilton, wasn’t she? VB: Yes. They made her a citizen of Skyros, which is an island, and they were talking in their Parliament about having resort hotels on the island and she stood up and she said, “Not in my lifetime.” But then I took everything that was given in that department. Greek Monuments, Greek Sculpture, Greek History and then there was a Journal Club of Archeology that I just took every quarter. And she was an inspiration to me. CE: Well it did result – Forty years later, you did visit Greece. VB: Yes. I don’t know. CE: You graduated in ’37 and in ’77 you went to Greece. VB: Well that’s true, yes. I’m very delighted that it happened then. CE: All right, now when you graduated from Stanford – By the way, did you live down there? VB: Oh yes. CE: You didn’t commute? VB: No that’s much too far. CE Did you enjoy campus life? VB: Yes, I enjoyed it, excepting that my father had died the year that I entered and so I was sad so I didn’t have that kind of rah-rah life. CE: You couldn’t share the joy with him? VB: No. But he did know that I was going so he was happy about that. CE: One of your classmates is Marshall Dill Jr. VB: Yes. CE: Who we’ve met through you. Any of your other classmates you ever see? VB: Well, Joan Hendlen who was my roommate. CE: Oh, up in the Seattle area, Tacoma or – VB: No, it’s Chehalis. Yes, and there’s another one who lives in Roseville. CE: Alright you are graduated now. What did you do with your life after graduation? Did you go to work? VB: I didn’t go to work right away. I stayed home for a year and I worked around the place, you know, painted things and clipped the hedges and things like that. CE: What road did you take? How did you want to utilize this education? VB: Well I had taken all the courses in education I needed to take excepting I needed more apprenticeship in the schools, but – CE: Were you thinking of becoming a teacher? VB: Yes, I was, but I never wanted to be – CE: As an avenue –  VB: Yes, but so I didn’t. So then I went to work in Hale’s Department store, in the office, because someone had introduced me there because Marshall Hale and Reuben Hale had been my father’s clients. CE: You mean there was a tie there? VB: There was a tie there, yes. And so I stayed there for about two years and I didn’t get a vacation that whole time. CE: I must interrupt you for a moment. I’m loosing track of the fact that before your father died in the ‘20s, you did get the house in Marin and the property. VB: Yes. CE: And that was your retreat for any holidays and summers and weekends? VB: Yes, my father died in 1933, October 23. CE: So he did have a few years there. VB: Yes, yes. I nearly had a double mastoid. That specialist in San Francisco gave me when my own doctor, Dr. Mary E. Glover, was away, so Dr. Langley Porter blew my cold into my ears and I was threatened with a double mastoid. So Dr. Glover said, “Don’t take her down the Peninsula because there’s too much malaria, but take her to Marin.” Well, my father came over and looked and looked very hard to find anything and finally he found this cottage, the Freitag Cottage, it was called. And so we were there for six months. Then we went back the next year for a vacation. Not the same house, but a different place. Then we went again for a vacation and my mother and father took a walk up Marquard Avenue, which was not paved then, and my mother fell in love with the redwoods because there had been redwoods in Crescent City where she went for her vacations when she was a little girl. CE: And didn’t you tell me she had gone by boat there sometimes? VB: Yes, these little lumber schooners. CE: Yes, tell us about that. Digress a moment in that area. VB: Yes, they went by lumber schooner and she was the only person in the family who wasn’t seasick. And – CE: What happened? VB: Well that was the only way of access, and she loved it. And when she was twelve years old they thought she was going to die, the doctor thought she was going to die, and should go to some hot place, meaning Arizona or something, and she wanted to go to Crescent City, on the beaches. And he said, “Well it won’t make any difference. You might just as well let her do it.” And so she did, and she was happy and she recovered and they went up there every – CE: Would that be – The kind of vessel she went on would be sort of like the Wampama or the Thayer that are berthed at the San Francisco Historical – VB: We have it. I bought it for her to give to one of her friends. It’s called Ships of the Redwood Coast. We have it in the library. Perhaps you have it, I don’t know. CE: Yes. VB: So Tuesday – That was Sunday, and Tuesday he came home with the deed to the lot. CE: Well first you bought just the virgin land, and then you built the home on it. VB: Yes, right. And then that was – It was built in 1925, built in 1924 and then it slid. There was a landslide and it slid down the hill fifteen feet.  CE: How large a piece of property are we talking about? Two acres? VB: Two acres. CE: And there was a grotto. VB: Yes, there was a grotto. CE: And lots of blue stone has been taken from there. VB: Mined And there’s a spring. CE: There’s a spring and there’s a swimming pool. VB: Yes. CE: Well, tell me, when your father died, did you relocate over there permanently shortly thereafter? VB: We did it before. CE: Before he – VB: Before, because my grandfather wasn’t well and we thought it would be good for him to be over here. CE: Would you take the train and the ferry and go to Hale Brothers and etc.? VB: Yes. CE: How did you enjoy that commute? VB: I loved the commute but I didn’t like the business work. CE: Didn’t like the business world? VB: No. CE: You really wanted to get back in the academic milieu. How did you do it, Virginia? VB: Well, when I lost my mother, which was March 1, 1957, and I wanted to do something for humanity, and there was an opening at juvenile hall, so I applied. CE: In Marin County? VB: In Marin County. I applied and I took an oral and I got it. I got the job and it’s very, very hard work, you know, because they’re so emotionally wrought up and if you have any feeling at all – and I have lots of feeling for people – why, it’s very difficult. CE: I would think that would be a devastating area to be in if you’re sensitive at all. VB: Yes, it is. So I stayed about two years, I guess, a little more than two years, and I left there in 1958 or ’59, I’m not sure. Then there was an opening at the County Library and so I went in, and Mrs. Keating interviewed me. CE: Are we in the new building at Civic Center? VB: No, we’re in the old building. CE: Down at San Rafael? VB: The old Coleman School. CE: Okay. VB: And she said, “This is only for $50 a week or something.” Anyway, I think once a week at Marin City, and would I be interested? She said, “We would want a college graduate.” And I said, “Well I am a college graduate.” And so she accepted me and I started. She hired me to work on Saturdays and I worked Saturdays, every Saturday for seven years and in the meantime we moved into the new building in 1962. CE: Well that was the right decision.  VB: Yes, it was. And at first I was on the desk, then I was Young Adult Librarian after I got my library degree. CE: Now, tell us a little bit about that. How could you possibly work and go over to the University of California in Berkeley nights, or whenever you did it, and get your Master of Library Science? How could you do that physically? VB: Well, I just did it. CE: When did you go to school, at night? VB: No, in the daytime for the most part. I worked every night and I worked every Saturday. I went to school in the daytime and I ate my dinner, or lunch as the case may be, driving back and forth. My first quarter, I was so sleepy that I couldn’t sit down and study for my exams. I had to stand up because if I sat down I fell asleep. CE: Alright, so you finally got your degree. Did that take you a couple of years or what, Virginia? VB: It took me seven quarters. CE: Seven quarters. Now, by virtue of receiving that degree, what did that do to your career? VB: Well that meant that I was a librarian. CE: Had Virginia Keating by that time thought of retiring? VB: No, not yet. So then I was Young Adult Librarian for all the libraries in the system. CE: What did that mean? The acquisition of books? The advertising of them? The distribution of them to the – VB: Yes, displays and programs. CE: I imagine you liked that? VB: Yes, I did like it. CE: Alright, what else? Continue. VB: Well, then after doing that for, I don’t know, maybe a couple of years, I had to compete for the position of Branch Librarian and I won it. Then Bruce didn’t like to be in his office, because the public wandered in and asked him questions. CE: Well, wait a minute, back up a minute. Virginia Keating had gone by then? Had she retired? Who was Virginia’s replacement? VB: Bruce Bajema. CE: She hired Bruce? VB: Yes. She hired him from Mendocino County. CE: Why did she do that, I wonder? VB: Well she wanted a man because she didn’t think that any woman could replace her. CE: And certainly a lady from Stanford would have been most extraordinary. VB: Well, some people thought that I would be the right person, but anyway she went to these meetings with him, with the other directors of the other libraries in the North Bay Cooperative Library System. And so then, she did retire and had a retirement dinner at Deer Park Villa, and she seems to be enjoying her retirement. CE: Well, I wonder if you would interject now and clarify to whomever is listening to this tape in the future. Your office was in the headquarters on the fourth floor where the Marin County Librarian has his headquarters, the Civic Center Branch?  VB: Yes. CE: But it could just as well be in another building, could it not? VB: Yes. CE: You were the Branch Librarian in the same area that the administration offices were? VB: Yes, that’s right. And it later became my office. He didn’t like it because too many people came in, and – CE: Right off the elevator and there he was. VB: Yes, and he didn’t want to be bothered with the public. CE: Well, I think it’s time we ought to say what his interest was. VB: His interest was the computer. CE: He was terribly interested in the computer and what it could do. It could do everything. And service was an intangible that wasn’t too important. And your whole life had been motivated by service. VB: Service to the community, yes. CE: Now let’s talk a little bit now about the California Room. Tell us the beginnings of that. VB: Well the beginnings of that was just a little cupboard in – CE: The Coleman School? VB: The Coleman School, and then she prevailed upon the – CE: She who? VB: Mrs. Keating prevailed upon the Department of Public Works to put a wall, two walls, in the hall. So then there was this room with one locked cupboard and all the others open shelves, and that was the California Room. CE: Well, what was her idea in creating the California Room, as you best understood? VB: Well, she was just crazy about California and she did buy everything she could, unless it was too expensive, for the California Room. Then when we moved in 1962 to the new building, there was this California Room where it is now. CE: And she insisted that space be left? VB: Yes. And she continued to buy very heavily on Californiana. CE: Well you know she used to be given credit for doing, initially, collecting initially for the California room without the advantages of your education and your MLS. She is to be, I think, to be given a great deal of credit. VB: I think so, too, yes. CE: But the California Room, as I understand it, blossomed and grew and became known and was used when you became the Branch Librarian and I think you can say that with all modesty. VB: I think I can say that. For one thing, Ida, her secretary, never wanted to let anybody use anything and I was always anxious to have it used. CE: Well, the California Room was a great deal to you further. Do you remember the battle you fought a year ago to keep the California Room? VB: Yes, I remember and even before that, Bruce wanted to take that space and put the Children’s Room in there and move that to the Children’s Room where it wouldn’t be the same at all. CE: Well tell me, do you think that Bruce Bajema has come to regard the collection with a little more favorable light over the months and years?  VB: Yes I think he has, so Margaret Parkerson tells me. CE: Do you think part of that was through the effort that you made writing the resolution and having the Board of Supervisors pass it unanimously? VB: Yes. Well Barbara Boxer, of course, is the one who kept it through – CE: To keep it in perpetuity. VB: Yes. CE: That opened his eyes. VB: Yes. And I think he gave up. CE: Well the library, financially, now has these personnel problems. Margaret Parkerson is in there as much as she can, I understand, and also had to double up as reference. VB: And she also doubles up on the desk, circulation desk. CE: But there still is the California Room. VB: Yes, and it will be there as long as the library is there. CE: That is something that you achieved. VB: Yes. CE: Now I’d like to talk a little bit about this Oral History Project that you created and got Mrs. Kent and me involved in. Tell us how that all began, Virginia. VB: Mrs. Kent came in one day and said she was going to make a speech at the Moya Library on the Ross Valley and so I helped her get material on Ross Valley. Then I believe Doris Schmiedell told me that it had been very well-received and she thought we should have a copy of it. And I asked Mrs. Kent, could we have a copy of it and she said there was a copy. CE: Well, had it been taped? VB: It had been taped and she would ask the person who taped it if we could have it. And I believe we did get it, I’m not positive. CE: Yes, you did. VB: So then Mrs. Bissinger was coming to lunch about, oh, films, I think, that we might want to show, and so I asked Mrs. Kent and you to come also and we went to lunch at the Taverna Yassou. CE: Yes. Now as I remember. Mrs. Kent has now joined us. Mrs. Kent, we had meanwhile had the Old Timers Weekend or something at the Marin Art and Garden Center, had we not? The “Good Old Days,” and you thought it would be fun to corral some old pioneers and bring them up to the Octagon House and we would show some old photographs and collect some reminiscences. Is that – AK: Yes. Well, on that day, we had a great exhibit of all the pictures we could find, and we had them all around on the tables and on the walls and I thought that if these patrons, these old timers especially, who would be looking at the pictures maybe argue or maybe agree or whatever sounded very interesting. So I would walk up to one or two of them and say, “Would you mind going over to the desk and repeating what you just told me? That’s interesting.” And so it happened. They’d go over to the desk and Carla had the machine there and instead of having enough on one reel, as we have on a tape now, we have six or seven people, just little short things on each. That’s what started it. CE: Well you know how Mrs. Kent is. She’s a very persuasive woman. When I retired from the Navy after thirty years, she told me one day, “I have a project I’d  like you to help me with.” And I said, “What is it, Mrs. Kent?” And she said, “I think we’re going to do oral history.” And I said, “What’s that?” And she explained, and she said, “Well my father-in-law used to have Old Settlers’ Day and they’d collect people from all over the county and ask them to reminisce about what brought them to Marin County.” She said, “Now that they have this invention, I think we can do it,” and I said I’d never done anything like that. But she had a way of convincing you you can do anything so we went up that afternoon. Then somehow you heard about this, too, and you invited us up. Now continue the story. We brought some tapes, didn’t we? VB: I don’t know whether you brought some tapes then or not but – CE: We did. VB: Yes, you played your tapes of the Old Timers Day and I thought your voice was wonderful and just right for this kind of work. CE: Well you had been looking for a long time – VB: I’d been looking about two years. CE: Surely there must have been someone who could have done this, Virginia? VB: No, there wasn’t anyone else. CE: Were you concerned about the confidentiality of the material? VB: I was concerned about the voice, the voice that came through asking the questions. CE: Well, that’s partly important, but don’t you think in view of – For example, in Bancroft Library where they make a transcript of every tape, this is something hopefully we want to achieve and we’ve been able to get maybe fifteen done. That’s the ultimate tool, isn’t it, that most scholars want to use? They’d rather research it visually than listen to an hour’s tape. But I think, as you said, there was a great deal of personal and private material that we had collected. And you wanted to be sure it would be kept in an archival depository, and not be talked around. And you felt you could trust Mrs. Kent certainly with her background and you had somewhat of a similar feeling considering I had worked thirty years in the security group in classified intelligence. That was part of it, as you told me. VB: Yes that’s true, an honorable person. CE: Now, why is oral history important for Marin County? VB: Oral history is important for Marin County because there is so little written about Marin County, compared to what is written about San Francisco, for instance, or California in general. But a lot of this would simply be lost if it weren’t taken this way. CE: Well, you know, to date, we’ve interviewed about 180 people. VB: That’s quite a record. CE: And part of the criteria is that we must get somebody older you know, before they go, and she’s so right in this. We have gotten people who are no longer with us. Well, continue how we got in touch with the University of California and the Bancroft Library. You arranged a meeting there, remember? VB: Yes, I called Willa Baum up and said that we would like to come over because we would like to do something similar and we would like to – I think we were already doing it but we would like to know how to keep them, preserve them.  CE: Remember she had written a rather definitive book on how to collect local history for the oral historian and we had a copy of that in the library. VB: Yes, that’s right. CE: Well, lets see, then we went over, and they took us in the basement where they stowed this material. VB: Right, on shelves. CE: And they warned us to keep it free of magnetic fields, remember? VB: Yes. CE: Never use a vacuum or a buffer around – You could erase the material. Keep it at “people temperature” and they had so many things you couldn’t do. It scared us to death. Remember, Anne? AK: Yes. CE: Well okay, then what did we agree, that we’d do it? We must have. VB: Yes, well what we have is a file case, a steel file case, in a closet which is locked and it isn’t vulnerable to buffers and vacuums and that sort of thing. It’s just about as safe as it could be. CE: You then gave us our first assignment. Do you remember? Dr. Leo Stanley. VB: That’s right. We went up to his – CE: We went up with my tape recorder. Regina Jimenez went with hers. We brought Doris Schmiedell, Mrs. Kent, and you and I. VB: Yes, that’s right. CE: And had a delightful afternoon. VB: Yes. And he filled several tapes that day. CE: Yes, well Doctor Stanley was just great. You have in the archives of the California Room some of his papers, do you not? VB: Yes, we have the Leo L. Stanley Collection. We have everything that he – We have more on San Quentin than San Quentin has. CE: That reminds me of a point too. Last year, one of our talking points to keep the California Room in perpetuity. If you remember, Margaret Sanborn wrote letters, Mrs. Kent and I did, because we found out while going around interviewing people that they had wonderful photo albums. They had journals, and they had many things that fell in the category of ephemera. And they were asking us all the time, “Is there any place we can leave this material in Marin County? Does it all have to go to the Bancroft Library or the California Historical Society?” Or, reluctantly, they mentioned the Marin County Historical Society and they were afraid about that because they thought it – It’s a charming wooden Victorian building, but might pose a fire hazard. So, until you made the California Room in perpetuity, we couldn’t guarantee there was a place. Now, since then, we have received quite a few things. You made it possible, Mrs. Kent, I think, in talking to Marian Hayes Cain, to get the papers of the Mountain Theater. VB: Yes that’s right. We have the press books since 1913 with, I think, a couple of years missing, somebody borrowed and didn’t return. CE: What other papers do you have? AK: Well I know that we have Dr. Stanley’s – CE: You have prepared a bibliography. VB: Yes.  CE: VB: CE: VB: CE: VB: CE: VB: CE: VB: CE: VB: CE: VB: CE: VB: CE: VB: CE: VB: CE: VB: CE: VB: CE: VB: CE: VB: Your staff – You arranged for your staff to do this in time for the, honor of the California admission to the union in September 9, 1977 and this bibliography contains everything. Yes, everything on Marin in the California Room. Do you envision your – What would you like to see evolve with that room as time goes by? A greater – Greater collection and perhaps annual meetings there on Admission Day would be a nice idea. In your judgment, do you feel it’s a safe archival depository? Yes, just as safe as anything is. And it has many advantages in that, until Proposition 13, it was staffed professionally all the time. Yes. But that can return. I mean, full staffing, hopefully, may return someday. We hope. It’s open more than a voluntary museum staff could afford, like the Historical Society, that’s staffed just a few hours, a few days a week. What other advantages does it have? Well the material is catalogued. Yes. Well it isn’t all. Dr. Stanley’s isn’t cataloged yet, and I’d be glad to have that in the catalog, or in the computer now, as it would be. Oh that material is not in the computer – No. But the books are, but not the papers. Is that the way I understand you correctly? I don’t think any of his collection is in the computer, but it is all available. Well another thing I noticed with the California Room and, correct me if I’m wrong, but you have given a lot of programs in that room. That’s right. You’ve given receptions, like when Margaret Sanborn’s book on the American River was published, it seems to me you had a reception there – That’s right. Honoring that achievement. And you have had speaking programs there, relative to California. You had the Chinese programs. The Greek – Greek dancing, not in the California Room, out in the library. You served food or something. Yes. That’s right, the Greeks served Greek food. The ambiance has been very warm and intellectual. Yes. Well, we had 400 people at that Greek dancing, and that’s the most people ever were at a program in one day. But you’ve also had shows. You’ve had photography shows. You’ve had art shows, and this material, it seems to me, is always spilling over into the California Room. Yes, well, we had, I think this is from Margaret Sanborn’s book too, we had paintings, one of which was worth $18,000, in the California Room for that display. That display had a great many things. That was the best display we ever had. We had Indian baskets, and Indian arrowheads, and one of those was ivory.  CE: VB: CE: VB: CE: W VB: CE: VB: CE: VB: CE: VB: CE: VB: CE: Or perhaps it was a bone arrowhead and my great-grandfather had cut that out of an Indian’s throat. I want you to tell us about that. Your great-grandfather had a close association with Indians there. Tell us about that. Well those were Yuroks and they – Anyway, the Indian didn’t flinch when he cut out the arrowhead. Tell us a little bit more about his Indian reminiscences or experiences. Well, I can say in Brewer’s book, Up and Down California, said that Dr. Edgar Mason and his gentlemen, whose word could be relied upon, rode out into the redwoods and he and four companions sheltered themselves and their horses in this one redwood tree, which is remarkable. I don’t really know any other – I know my grandfather gave an Indian an army overcoat with all these brass buttons which he dearly loved and he gave him hats and he wore one hat right on top of the other until he was wearing eight hats! ell – Yes, and when news of Lincoln’s election came, my grandfather rode horseback down to get the mail and Lincoln was elected and my mother said to him, “And how did you feel?” He said, “We felt terrible.” So, going back to that, my great- grandfather, Dr. Mason, gave money to the Confederacy, but they were out here then and they couldn’t fight, but his wife’s brothers fought in the Confederacy on the Confederate side. Well now, getting back to the library, I want you to mention – We forgot to mention, we had a big party once. Remember? Oh, we had a lovely party. It cost a lot of money. Champagne and – Do you remember that reception, May 16, 1976, when we had 200 people in the library? Yes, in the whole library. And what was that for? That was for Oral History and for people who had been interviewed. I think we had done 100 people at that time and by the time they brought their wives or their husbands or their sweethearts or their chauffeurs. We had 200 people and you very graciously picked up the bill to rent the building. VB: Yes. CE: We had to get permission from the Board of Supervisors to open the building on a Sunday, and pay them $200. VB: Yes, yes. CE: And then I think, if I remember, the Moya Library and the Friends of the Marin County Library, as well as yourself, chipped in and paid for the champagne and whatnot. VB: Yes. CE: But that was a nice event. VB: It really was, yes. People enjoyed it.  CE: We had put up in the California Room all of the photographs we had collected to date. Everybody seemed to enjoy meeting people they hadn’t seen in years. Mrs. Gilbert, her photographs – Tell us about that. VB: Yes. Her father had a furniture store in San Rafael on Fourth Street and she saw his store and later I had that copied, at my own expense, and sent it to her. She was so pleased. CE: Well, let’s leave the library for a moment, Virginia, and get you back on those horses that you love. You stated earlier when you were a child you used to take a horse out of Larkspur. But tell us, as you grew up, and your involvement and ultimately membership in the Tamalpais Trail Riders. Tell us about that organization. VB: Well, that was the first horse organization in Marin County. There are a good many now, but this was the earliest. And Dr. Stanley was my sponsor in it. CE: What year did you join? VB: I joined in 1949 or ’50, I’m not quite sure. And that was the year that Doris came back from Carmel. CE: Doris who? VB: Doris Schmiedell of Ross. CE: A friend of yours? VB: A very dear friend of mine since then. CE: Did you meet in this organization? VB: That’s right. And she had a horse called Feather and I had a horse called Flash, and Feather and Flash were friends also. And Doris didn’t want Feather to eat on the trail so she tied her head up and so Flash picked bunches of grass up and Feather took them in her mouth. CE: You can’t win. VB: No. CE: VB: CE: VB: At CE: VB: CE: VB: CE: VB: CE: Well, where would you ride? Well we rode on the water district. Where did you keep your horse? Walter Elliott’s. Where is that? That’s the Marin Stables in Fairfax and he took very good care of the horses. And when he saw a picture of a group of people, well the Board of Directors, on their horses, he said, “That’s a good picture. All the horses have their ears front.” He didn’t care what the people looked like, but the ears were front so the horses were happy. Well, when would you ride? Well, weekends, Saturdays and Sundays and on my vacations. And I rode a good deal with Doris, particularly on weekends. I notice you have, outside of your office, between your office and the California Room, a little cut-out of wood with little brass name tags on it and it’s got Doris’ name on it. What is that for? That’s for contributions, generous contributions, to the California Room. Mrs. Kent’s name is on it. Your name is on it. Time, energy, money, whatever?  VB: Yes. The Friends of the Library. Dr. Stanley has a little plaque on it. CE: Is that your idea, Virginia? VB: Yes, that was my idea. CE: With this personnel problem, coming back to that, could you envision any sort of a volunteer staff assisting over this period? VB: Well it’s possible, if the people have the time to do it. CE: And were properly indoctrinated and took it seriously. VB: That’s right, yes. CE: Well look at how they use volunteers in hospitals: the Pink Ladies. Those are dedicated women. Just because you’re a volunteer and don’t get money doesn’t mean you have to erode your standards. VB: No, there aren’t nearly as many Pink Ladies now as there used to be. CE: Well there’s not a lot of as many things as there used to be. But rather than see it not used, wouldn’t you welcome such an idea? VB: Yes surely, I would, I would. But then I have no authority. CE: No. Well I’m looking for suggestions. VB: Yes. You know, if you have a few hours to go there, but I don’t know how you would have, with everything else you do. CE: Well we spend hundreds of hours, as you know. VB: Thousands of hours. CE: Thousands of hours, and we’ve traveled thousands of miles. Well, let’s get back on the trail. I had the pleasure once of going to one of your breakfasts at Dr. Stanley’s. VB: Yes, those were wonderful breakfasts. CE: On Crest Farm. And how would that come about? You would ride early in the morning and then come back and have – followed by a breakfast? VB: That’s right. CE: Now you were an officer in the Tamalpais Trail Riders, weren’t you? VB: Yes I was the secretary for years. CE: And – VB: Oh yes, on the Board of Directors. The trophy was for the liaison work I did with the water district. CE: What was that, might I ask? VB: Well the Most Valuable Member of the Year. But I worked on getting a trail named for Doris, and that was when I went to the meeting. First I went down and talked to the trail manager and he didn’t see any objection, and then I went to the meeting where it was to come up, and both the other people who were active then had to leave to call home, so I was left when it came up and I made a pitch for it and I can be very convincing. CE: Yes, I would agree with that. We’ve been to many Board of Supervisors meetings, have we not, Mrs. Kent, where Virginia has stood up and been most articulate. When Bruce was unable to come up with the figures, you were always ready. VB: So then I said all that she had done for the Trail Riders, and all that she had done for the outdoors in the county, and that I thought that the Tamalpais Trail Riders,  CE: VB: CE: VB: CE: VB: CE: VB: CE: VB: CE: VB: CE: AK: VB: CE: VB: CE: VB: CE: VB: CE: VB: CE: AK: CE: VB: CE: VB: hoped that they would agree to have the Pilot Knob Trail named the Doris Schmiedell Pilot Knob trail. Now, wasn’t that achieved just within the last couple of years? Wasn’t that rather recent? Yes, about three years ago, I guess. How was Doris Schmiedell informed of it? By letter, or what? Yes, by letter, which I took to here. And she was very pleased. How long did you two friends ride? Until you had to give up your horses individually? Yes. I A Twenty year association? Fifteen? think twenty. I notice that the – Well we know that Doris has been a patron of the Oral History Project and she’s done other things for your California Room and your library. Yes, she’s given us – Oh she gave us an olla for the California Room what? An olla. It’s like a mortar and pestle. That’s a Spanish name for it. And she gave us that little picture of where John Muir lived, the Hutchins cabin, and her father took that picture, Edward G. Schmiedell, took that picture and it’s hanging on the wall in the library now. Well she has been a good friend to our program, hasn’t she, Mrs. Kent? Very a very good friend. Yes. Helped us financially when we needed help. I think we must get in this, too. I want you to tell us what the library did in support of this Oral History Project. You would provide all the tapes. Yes, that’s right, we would provide the tape. And any photographs that we took. You know, we would go to somebody’s home and they say, “You may copy this for your archives,” and you underwrote the cost of the film and the development. Yes, right. And that’s how we have quite a collection now of eight-by-tens. Films, yes. Very nice. And I think everything else then we contributed or the Moya Library would pay – Yes. We had to buy file cabinets and we had to – And a few friends, but we are very grateful for the support that we get and the support your library was able to give us until July of last year. But we will continue this project, won’t we, Mrs. Kent? I hope to. And somehow we have the attitude that it will all work out in some way. So before we close, I want you to tell us what you are going to do now. You’ve retired from the library last July, and – What keeps you busy now? Are you doing something – My two broken hips are what keep me busy, but yes, I read. You read a good deal? Yes.  CE: Would you like to go out on some interviews with us? VB: Well, that would be nice sometimes. CE: Any follow up on that? VB: Yes, would be very nice. CE: You do think we must continue this project? Even though you’re not there? VB: I do, and I do think that the library ought to be able to pay for the films and the – CE: I’ll tell you how we’re working that out now. I’m just buying the film and taking the photographs, and then we’re waiting until we get monies to develop them. Do you follow me? At least I have a file of negatives, and the day comes when we’re going to print eight-by-ten photographs from them will be down the road. But there’s no use denying ourselves a collection. VB: No. CE: Well, Virginia, it has been a pleasure to talk with you today and I’m so happy that we’ve had this opportunity to get on tape not only your story, but all of your achievements and efforts that you’ve made in the Marin County Library system and also to make clear once and for all, for the record, how you created the Oral History Program of Marin County. It has been a pleasure having you here today. VB: Thank you very much, Carla.
MarinCounty;Earl Dolcini;CE: Today is Thursday, August the 9th, 1984. And continuing the Oral History Program for the Anne Kent California Room, this is Carla Ehat. And joining me today is Mrs. Jordan Martinelli. And we are way out in a beautiful part of Marin. It is called Hicks Valley? ED: No, this is the Petaluma-Marshall Road. CE: Petaluma-Marshall Road. And we are on the Dolcini Ranch. And part of that -- One of the members of that family has agreed to share a little bit of his family‟s story with us today, and his name is Earl Dolcini. Good morning, Earl. ED: Good morning. CE: What brought your family to Marin County? Did you ever hear the stories? ED: I have heard some stories and hopefully they‟re somewhat reliable. My great- grandfather immigrated from Switzerland. CE: Swiss background. ED: He was born about 1830 and he was born in the Canton of Ticino in a valley called Valle Maggia in a little town called Cevio. And at 17 he left the area. And the reason he left was, if you‟ve ever seen it, there‟s really not too many ways to make a living there. It‟s rocks after rocks after rocks and so the main source of occupation anyone would ever learn would be masonry work, probably. But you can only build so many houses. Well, at any rate, he went to France when he was 17 and he worked there for three years and from France he went to Africa and worked for about a year. And I don‟t know what part of Africa, but I would suspect it would be French Morocco, due to the fact that he had been working in           France. And of course, that brings us up to the time when there was great news from California. CE: The gold rush. ED: The gold rush. CE: Isn‟t it fascinating how people came from all over the world and had this fever? Try your luck, go over there and make it, and go back home. ED: So he was a saving-type of individual, like a lot of Swiss are, and got on a boat, came around the Horn and into California and went up into the gold country. He had befriended a gentleman from Italy on the way over and so they worked together mining gold. They actually only mined for about a month. Toward the end of the month his friend was stabbed, and his gold was stolen from him. And he was killed. And so, coming from a line of cowards -- CE: He didn‟t want any part of that. ED: He didn‟t want any part of that. And so I understand he went down below the Peninsula, maybe below San Jose, somewhere in that area. CE: Had he -- Had he --Did he get any gold? ED: Nothing that amounted to anything. In fact, I should back up just a little bit. He came down to Sacramento, and being somewhat skilled in masonry work, there was someone building a building out of bricks. And he approached them and asked if he could have a job. And they said no, they didn‟t need anyone. Probably what I tell you following this sums up the man pretty well, in a sense. He waited until they went to lunch. And when they went to lunch he mixed some mortar and he continued doing something which he knew how to do, in relationship to building the building, and when the boss came back at one o‟clock he hired him. CE: Darned resourceful. GM: Sure! ED: So from there went on down somewhere below San Jose. I don‟t know exactly where. And I suspected that he probably milked, worked on ranches. CE: Do you know what his name was? ED: Yes, his name was Carlo Martinoia. GM: What was his name? ED: Carlo Martinoia. CE: And then he was down the Peninsula? Ok. He was still a young man in his twenties. ED: Right. At that point he came to Marin County. Don‟t ask me why, I really don‟t know what brought him up here. CE: There are no letters in the family or journals? ED: There are no letters that I‟m aware of. CE: Your father ever mention anything, or your grandfather? These are stories you -- ED: These are stories that were told to me by my father, yes. CE: But you don‟t know what brought him -- Well, I have heard from other Swiss ranchers that oftentimes they would -- What was her name? Nellie McIsaac? ED: Yes, she was a Codoni. CE: A Codoni. And her father sort of ran, unofficially, a Swiss Consulate. He was in touch with villages back in Switzerland and if he heard a rancher needed a milker  he‟d write them to come and they would stay at his house. Could that have possibly occurred? ED: Could very well have been, because if you‟ve noticed, the Swiss population in California all started in pockets, so to speak, and this was one of the pockets here. Salinas was another one. Fortuna was another one. CE: That‟s interesting. So he‟s here, working on some ranch, probably. ED: He‟s here. But in 1856 he owned property in Marin County, in Chileno Valley. CE: 1856? He pre-dates Thompson, then. ED: I‟m sure. CE: Because they were 1865. GM: Then they were 17 -- CE: No, no, 1865, the time of the Civil War. OK. ED: All right. Then somewhere within this time he wrote for his sweetheart, so to speak, Catrina. CE: A girl back home? ED: Yes. CE: This lovely lady? ED: Catrina Traversy. CE: Catrina? ED: Yes. CE: With a K or a C? ED: With a C. CE: Traversy. OK. ED: Then they were married, of course, and settled in Chileno Valley where he owned his first piece of property. CE: Did you ever -- She would be your great-grandmother? ED: Yes. GM: What was her name? CE: I have it. Catrina Traversy. All right, now, Chileno Valley is where we are. ED: No, no. You‟re on the Marshall-Petaluma Road, sometimes called Salmon Creek area, but not known by a lot of people as the Salmon Creek area because there‟s another Salmon Creek further north which is better known. CE: And the Chileno Valley is further west? ED: It‟s about three miles from here. Actually, part of this ranch goes down on the Chileno Valley side. CE: Chileno Valley has an interesting name. Chileno from Chile? ED: Yes, I believe that is correct, yes. There is quite a story behind that and I really can‟t – CE: It seems to me Franklin Burns told me something about that. Do you know about that? ED: I know Franklin. CE: And I don‟t recall it, though, but there is some -- I have to find out about that. Ok. ED: My great-grandmother had seven children. She had three boys and four girls. During the time that he was getting established and expanding, he provided a dairy for each one of his boys, and this was one of them. And he also operated a dairy, so, actually, he had four dairies going at one time. He was a different man  for his time. After he began to get established here, he got on the boat and went to San Diego. He went fifty miles east of San Diego, to Santa Isobel would be the area, and he purchased ten-thousand acres. CE: How resourceful. ED: Which were three ranches. And he got his countrymen to come over and run those ranches for him. But I don't know why he went to San Diego. It's interesting that he would go down there. CE: Well, Burbank, David Burgess Burbank, do you know that name? ED: I know the Burbank name, yes. CE: Okay. When Luther Burbank, which was David's uncle, came out here, he brought potato seeds. And then he wanted some other place to grow them, another climate, so he went to San Diego in that enterprise. Maybe there was communication, climate, you know? ED: I don't know. CE: Interesting. ED: Also, somewhere along the line, he became interested in dealing in property and he was a partner in what they called a commission house, in San Francisco. And, today, it would probably be referred to as an agricultural real estate organization. CE: A brokerage. ED: Yes, right. CE: Well, commission merchants were big. You know, in Marin, in some of these residential districts, like where I live in Ross, for instance, the affluence was derived by many of those families from being commission merchants. And, as I understand the term in the early days, the days of the forty-niners, if you had a little amount of money, and could buy anything and could put it in a warehouse somewhere and trade it off, you know, commission it off, you could make money, and they made a fortune. ED: I believe it. I believe it. He also acquired a butter factory in San Francisco. And he had a couple of tug boats that he owned that worked on the bay. CE: Have you had any member of your family research through the archives of the California Historical Society, on your great grandfather? I bet there's something in the archives there. ED: I would guess there would be. There has been some very light research, but nothing what you‟d call serious. Actually, we've been going downhill ever since that time. CE: I wouldn't say that. But the competition, perhaps, was a little less then. ED: Yes, and he evidently was a very ambitious man. CE: Yes, and he had a heck of a lot of initiative. ED: Yes, yes. CE: Do you have a photograph of him? ED: I have a picture. I'll show you that later. CE: Did he live to a good age? ED: Yes, he died in, I think, 1908 so that would make him 78, or 1906, maybe. He was in his middle seventies when he passed away. His wife preceded him in death. I think this was one of the last pictures. CE: There he is with – There are his three sons and his four daughters, right there.  ED: Yes. GM: Was he a large man? ED: No, I don't think so. GM: About your size? ED: Probably so. CE: He looks so European. He's a wonderful looking man. All right. ED: So then a Peter Dolcini – CE: Who was who? ED: My grandfather. CE: One of these three sons? ED: No, we're talking about in-laws now. See, my name is Dolcini, this man is Martinoia. CE: That was your great grandfather? ED: Yes. CE: Okay. I always forget you have to get them married and get -- ED: My great grandfather on the Dolcini side came from the same town in Switzerland, but he did not come to America. He left his wife and eight children, four boys and four girls, and emigrated to Australia in order to find employment. GM: Is that Peter? ED: No, his name was Joseph. CE: Well then, getting back to Carlo, he was your maternal great-grandfather? ED: He was my father's grandfather. I should also probably mention the fact that he changed his name to Charles Martin. GM: When did he do that? ED: Well, I don't know, probably when the wheels got rolling and people couldn't pronounce his name, and so forth. CE: Charles Martin, okay. Now I understand more. Okay, your Dolcini antecedent then, to recap, born in the same village but immigrated to Australia. ED: Yes. CE: Ok. ED: And died within six months, in Australia. CE: My goodness. ED: So, wife became a widow with eight children. Now, it was not unusual at that time for these men to go to Northern Italy so seek passage to Australia because a lot of Swiss went to Australia at that time, and there was a lot of competition among the ship owners. They would show you what a grand ship they had and what good food they served, etc., etc. As soon as they got over the horizon things changed drastically. In fact, a good many of them died before they ever got to Australia. CE: Well what did the widow do with eight children? ED: Well, she tried to raise them, to a degree. But now the boys started coming to California, and all the boys came to California. Two of them ended up in Marin County: my grandfather, Peter, and his brother, Mike. CE: Peter and his brother, Mike. Ok. ED: And the other two boys settled west of Santa Maria: Joseph and Henry. CE: Okay.  ED: Peter, being a young man with a gleam in his eye, spotted this Martinoia girl, Anita, and they were married. Peter came here about 1880, I think, during those years. CE: Where did he meet Anita? ED: Well, Peter worked in the Nicasio area and rented a ranch from Mr. Pacheco, Mr. Pacheco being from the Pachecos right across from Hamilton Field. CE: Yes, I just interviewed the wife last week. And I had done the husband ten years ago. Wonderful man he was, I liked him. Okay, Peter was then working in Nicasio, and Anita? ED: Anita was Anita Martin and he courted her and married her. CE: Okay, that's your granddad. ED: Yes. CE: Then they came and lived on one of these ranches? ED: On this Pacheco Ranch, near Nicasio. I can recall my aunt telling me that she would ride with her father, Peter, down to pay the rent at Pacheco's and often he would give them a half a sack of oranges. CE: Are you talking about the house that Gumacindo Pacheco built across from Hamilton Field? ED: Yes. CE: Those beautiful orange trees. ED: Yes. GM: They're still there. CE: Peter and Anita, then, that's your grandfather-- ED: They, as I say, they rented a ranch from Pacheco in the Nicasio area and followed the dairy business. Peter, having married into the right family, was able to borrow the money from his father-in-law in order to purchase the ranch from Pacheco for $25,000. CE: Gosh, was it a big place? ED: Yes, it was about fourteen hundred acres. And that's a good ranch, still is a good ranch. CE: What year would that be, roughly? That's before -- Let‟s see -- Trying to think -- ED: At the point that he bought the ranch I really don't know for sure. I would guess that it would have been maybe before the turn-of-the-century. CE: Just before the turn? ED: I'll take it back. It would be later than that, wouldn't it? CE: Sure. Wait a minute, sure. Was he thirty when he bought it? ED: My father was born in eighty-eight. Yes, it was before the turn-of-the-century when he bought the ranch. CE: Okay, good. GM: Did he buy it from the Pachecos? ED: Yes. CE: Now is that still in the family? ED: Yes. CE: Good. All right, now then, your dad? ED: Now they had five children. CE: Five children?  ED: Three boys and two girls. CE: One of the boys your dad? ED: Yes, Arnold CE: And Arnold was your father? ED: Yes. ED: Are you very much like Arnold? ED: I don't know. You'd have to ask someone else. CE: Okay. Was he born out here too? ED: He was born on that ranch in Nicasio. And his mother was born in a ranch in Chileno Valley. I often tell -- People ask me, you know, or I get a chance to speak before, you know, local groups sometimes in Marin County, and most of them, of course, are people who have come in the last twenty years, right? CE: Right. ED: You know, I say that -- I say I was born in Marin County and spent all of my life here in agriculture. I say my father was born in Nicasio and he spent all of his life in Marin County, in agriculture. His mother was born in Chileno Valley and she spent all of her life here in agriculture. But I say I kind of have to apologize for my great grandfather because he only ranched here for about fifty-two years. CE: All right then, we can move on a little bit. Your father and mother -- Who did he marry? ED: He married Catherine Connely. CE: Catherine Connely? ED: Yes. I also have a little bit of Marin County historical information, on her side. CE: Ok. ED: My great-grandfather was John Gallagher, on her side. And he came from New York and sailed into San Francisco Bay in 1847 with the American Army. CE: Say that again. He did what? ED: He joined the army in New York. He was a blacksmith and he joined the army in New York and they outfitted three ships to come to San Francisco in order to take the area away from the Mexicans. CE: Right. ED: And so he sailed into San Francisco in 1847. Three ships, two of them with men aboard and the other with supplies. And they tied up at Yerba Buena Island, which was a protected area. And they sent the supply ship over to Sausalito to get the water and so forth. CE: That's great. ED: And of course it took them probably a couple of months to get ready to make an attack on the Presidio and when -- CE: This John Gallagher came in 1847 and then, of course, California -- It was the Mexican War and then California became a part of the United States. What happened to John Gallagher? Did he -- ED: John Gallagher went to -- CE: Did he come over here? ED: Well, first he went to Stockton and he wrote to his girlfriend in New York, Margaret McQuaid, and she came across by covered wagon, and with her sister, and they were married. But he was not in Stockton all that long, and wouldn't you  know, he came to an area quite close to here and bought a small ranch that was partly in Marin County and partly in Sonoma County. CE: There are a few. Interesting. Okay, now, they had children, of course, and one of them was their daughter, Catherine, is that correct? ED: Well, no, but they had children. One was my grandmother. CE: Grandmother, excuse me. I get the generations mixed up. Do you have trouble that way, a little? ED: I don't have much trouble. CE: You're smarter than I am. ED: One of them was my grandmother. She married a gentleman by the name of Bernard Connely, from Ireland, and one of their children was my mother, Catherine Connely. CE: Catherine Connely was your mother? ED: Yes. CE: And her mother's name wasn't Catherine also, was it? ED: No, her mother's name was Louise. CE: Okay, and was she born out here? ED: My mother was born in Petaluma. CE: In Petaluma? ED: Yes, and her mother was born in Stockton. CE: Where was your mother living with her family then? ED: In Petaluma. CE: On the ranch? ED: No, they weren't on that ranch very long. I don't know why. CE: They lived in town? ED: My mother lived in town, yes. CE: And you came along. ED: Well, she met my father first. My father's mother, Anita, was ill with cancer, and my mother was a registered nurse. And so my mother came to take care of my father's mother as a live-in nurse. And, wouldn't you know, she picked him off. CE: Interesting. Where did your mother get her training as an RN? Did you ever know? ED: Yes, I know, but I can't think of the name. It was a school in San Francisco but I can't think of the name of it. If I heard it I'd probably know it. CE: Could it have been St. Luke's? ED: No, it wasn't St. Luke's, I know that. CE: And when were married -- When were they married? ED: I think about 1914 or „15. Going back to my father, my father grew up on the ranch at Nicasio and attended the little one-room school house in the Nicasio area. From that point his parents sent him down to Santa Clara which was not really a university at the time, but more like we would think in terms of the prep school today, possibly. And this was not a new thing in the family in that his uncles had preceded him by going to Santa Clara in the 1800s. CE: Santa Clara is a wonderful school and they take pride in this. They were perhaps the only seminary group for men at that time. So that is quite an achievement.  And think of the foresight to want to do that. Even though you're on the land and totally involved in agriculture, this gave him something. ED: There's another kind of coincidence in the background here, that I mentioned John Gallagher. My grandfather had purchased a small ranch partly in Sonoma, partly in Marin. My grandfather, Peter Dolcini, eventually bought that ranch and we still have it today. CE: All right, now your parents were living in Petaluma when you were born? ED: No, my parents were living in Hicks Valley. CE: Did they get a ranch there? ED: Yes. Actually my father never lived in town. When they were first married they lived on a ranch in Nicasio, and then, about 1916 or „17, they purchased this ranch in Hicks Valley from the Brown Family. There was a prominent land holder by the --partners, Brown and Brandon, and they had four ranches in the area. CE: Were they speculators or were they real ranchers? ED: No, they were real ranchers. CE: All right now, you were born when? ED: I was born in the middle of the depression, the only bright spot. CE: Such modesty! What's your birth date? ED: Twelve March, 1929. Notice I say that like a Navy person. CE: I know, and I still write numbers that way and people say, "Why do you do it?" I write my checks that way. ED: So do I! CE: OK. Are you one of several? ED: I'm one of six. CE: One of six? ED: Yes, I'm the baby. CE: The baby? Now, before you tell us about your married life, and your marriage and your children, tell me little bit about the ranches that are in your family and who‟s interested in what. We have to talk about what you do raise here besides hay and cattle and -- ED: Well, someone was asking me the other day, you know, “Are you in agriculture and have you been for quite awhile?” And I think I answered by telling him that, “You know, you milk cows twice a day,” and I said that our family, starting out with my great grandfather, now is approaching 93,000 uninterrupted trips to the barn. CE: I love it, I love it. Now that is a dramatic statement. They're always talking about demographics today, that ought to be a capital D. You have how many ranches in your family? ED: Well, there's a group of us relatives. CE: Relatives -- get together -- ED: Yes and -- CE: Maybe this isn't for public knowledge, I don't know. ED: I don't know either. But actually all of the ranches that were acquired are still within the family. Now some of the family has separated as far as the collective ownership is concerned, but they are -- CE: Still there?  ED: Yes, yes. CE: That's great. Do you have them totally in Marin County? ED: No, they're not all in Marin County. One is partly in Sonoma County and we have one ranch west of Santa Maria, near Guadalupe that my grandfather, Peter, got from his two brothers, Joseph and Henry, because they weren't doing well down there, and he continued to loan them money to the point where he had to take the ranch over. CE: Are most of the family interested in it? Or, like the Thompson Family over there? Very few have splintered off, they're sort of stuck with it. ED: We have a surplus of interest in ranches. Surplus of people interested in ranches. Although we've been rather prolific. There are three of us brothers and we have twenty- one children. CE: How many do you have? ED: I only have eight. CE: Eight? ED: Yes. CE: Boys, too, in that group? ED: I have five flowers and three weeds. CE: I love that. You ought to speak at the Rotary Club every month, they'd love it. GM: You have five flowers and what? ED: Three weeds. CE: Okay, let's talk about this ranch for a moment. Does this ranch have a name other than -- ED: This is the League Ranch. CE: League? Why that? ED: The only thing that I can surmise is that a league is a measurement of land, and hence it must have acquired the name that way. End, Side A CE: Okay, now this ranch that we are on, and you have this lovely home was built by whom, incidentally? ED: By my great grandfather. CE: Your great grandfather? Do you think of this as sort of the home place? ED: No, I don't, because I grew up in Hicks Valley and that's the home place for me. CE: Is that house still standing? ED: Oh yes, oh yes. CE: Equal architecture? ED: Much better house than this. CE: Really? ED: Oh yes. This is a -- I mean it's a real house, this is a halfway house. CE: I think this is charming. All right, what do you do on this ranch? Is this beef cattle or is this -- ED: This is beef cattle. CE: Beef cattle, okay. How many acres are here? ED: There about twenty-five hundred acres. CE: For the lay person, who might be listening to this, you raise beef cattle for market?  ED: Yes. CE: Any particular kind of beef cattle? ED: Well, they're Hereford cattle. CE: Hereford. Are they ranged? ED: They are what you would call range cattle. CE: And your responsibility -- ED: We call it cow calf operation. We have a herd of brood cows and then, you know, they have their calves and then we take the calves. We wean the calves from them at about eight or nine months and then we just let the cows do it over again. CE: How many cattle do you have at one time, would you say? ED: There are about two hundred head of cattle. CE: And you have some of these Mexican boys to help you? ED: The Mexican boys help me primarily on the dairy. I operate a dairy in Hicks Valley, where I grew up. CE: But this is just -- Getting back to this beef, I'm terribly naive in this. You raise them and then, when it's time to market, do they come here to you? You know, how do you drive them somewhere? ED: No, no, they're all trucked of course. Most people who are in this type of business, sell their calves at weaning time, and somebody else buys them and does something else with them. I'm a little odd, as you probably noticed. I take the calves and I put them on another ranch and I keep them for a year and we call them feeder cattle at that point. And then I put them in a feed lot and have them custom fed in Oakdale and then they are sold there to slaughter concerns. CE: So it's really an alive business, the young are coming in, the newer born, and very transitional. ED: Yes. CE: Are you happy with the market today or not? ED: Well, the meat market is about what it was ten years ago. CE: That doesn't tell me anything. Does that mean good or bad? Average? It hasn't kept up? ED: It hasn't kept up. It started to move ahead and then it slipped back. CE: Driving out here we passed a big collection of hay. ED: Yes. CE: Is that necessary? Do you have to do supplemental feeding? ED: Well that was a dairy where you saw that. CE: Oh, dairy, but do you have to feed your cattle? ED: I feed them a little in the fall. It is not a very good ranch. You see, the number of acres and the number of cattle tells you it's not a very good ranch. CE: Okay, but you have an interest in a dairy ranch as well? ED: Yes. CE: And how many dairy cows do you have to milk there everyday? ED: We milk about 170 or 175 cows. CE: Do you do that yourself? ED: Well, we have -- It's hired. Although we do it ourselves sometimes. CE: Milking machines? ED: Yes.  CE: I saw that for the first time out at Franklin Burns's place. He's got three hundred, he and one man do it. ED: I know, and he's a bachelor. CE: Do you find it difficult to get help for a dairy ranch? ED: No. CE: In the days when you had to hand-milk maybe it was more difficult. ED: When I was growing up we were always able to get help with the exception of during the period of World War II, and it was not possible to get the amount of help that you really needed. CE: Of the two types of ranching, does one take preference over the other for you? ED: I don't know if it takes preference. I probably am closer to the dairy industry in that that's historically what the family has always done although they did have some beef cattle, too. But when I grew up, and I grew up during World War II, and when I was in the eighth grade I was the one who ran the machines in the barn. CE: Really? ED: Of course some people grew up loving it and some people grew up hating it. CE: Do you love it? ED: Yes. GM: Do your children work on the ranch? ED: Do my children? I have two boys working with me now, yes. CE: Are they home today? ED: They're both working, yes. One of them is working on this place, one of them is over at the dairy. And then Sam, my youngest boy, he's working somewhere too, I think. CE: On the dairy ranch you have -- I've seen those stainless steel containers where the milk goes up and looks like glass, isn't touched by human hands, and travels into this room where it's chilled. And they pick that up everyday? ED: Yes. CE: Is that a co-operative? What do you call that? It comes in a big tank car. ED: There's a co-operative creamery in Petaluma that buys milk in bulk. But there are also independent organizations such as Foremost, Carnation. CE: And you have these arrangements? ED: Yes, right. CE: Come rain or shine, Sundays or holiday, the cows have to be milked. ED: Exactly. CE: Does that cause any aggravation or discontent among the troops or -- ED: If you haven't grown up with it, it has a tendency to get in the way sometimes. But if you grow up with it it's just part of your life and you accept it. Sunday is a day off, all you do is what you have to do, nothing else. CE: When does that occur, early in the morning, isn't it? And by three in the afternoon? ED: We start at four in the morning and three in the afternoon. It takes about two and a half hours to milk, three hours at the most. CE: What, in your judgment, are the advantages of the life that you lead? I can see that you are a very well balanced man who enjoys life.  ED: It's a very different kind of life in today's world. It's very demanding in a sense, in that you operate everyday and something could go wrong at anytime, but you learn to accept that, and you learn to adjust to it. I love what I do. In fact, it's sinful, I think, that -- CE: You should be doing something that gives you such pleasure. ED: Yes. And you are conned into the philosophy of thinking that you are your own boss. CE: Well, in a way, you certainly -- Outside factors determine a lot of things, but you are your own boss. If you didn't want to work, the whole shebang would go pop. ED: That's right. CE: So you have control, somewhat. ED: It has a tremendous amount of opportunity for learning and for management. And if you are inclined this way there's no end to what you can learn and how much you can improve. I know what should be done but I don't do it all the time. CE: But it's that teasing challenge always ahead of you. ED: Yes, yes. There are so many different facets. You know, with animals, you have health, you have nutrition. With the kind of business that we have you have to purchase a great many things, and so you learn the marketplace. You have to maintain what you have and so you learn how to repair many different things. You have to sell your products, with the milk not so much, but with the beef cattle you do, so you have to negotiate, which is not done everyday today. CE: So you have very well diversified, well rounded actions. You are not locked into one facet of life. ED: Actually I could spend full time just raising a family. CE: The disadvantages, by contrast, are minimal to you. ED: Well, there are some real disadvantages. One of the disadvantages is we don't get to say, really, what we get for our product. We have to take what's given, basically. C.E: Is that because of that so called "middle man down the road," or what? E.D: No, it's the nature of agricultural business. When you -- Of course, I'm not a farmer, but when a farmer puts his crop in, he doesn't know how much money he's going to get for it. C.E: That unknowable factor, yes. E.D: And so it is risky, it is very risky. C.E: Like for the farmer, does the weather enter into your operation? E.D: Oh, very much so. C.E: In what ways? E.D: Because we depend on the forage for a great deal of our operation as far as feeding the cattle is concerned, the natural forage. And the reason there are so many cattle in this particular area -- Marin County is a utopian area for cattle. We have an excellent quality of grass, the natural grass. We have air conditioning, provided by the fog, and we don't have what you'd really call cold winters. The climate is perfect for cattle. CE: Both dairy and beef? ED: Both dairy and beef. Also, Marin County provides about twenty-five percent of the milk supply for the bay area which most people don't know.  CE: That much? ED: That much. And it is sought after because the milk from Marin County -- The youngsters in the families that buy the milk tell them that it tastes better. CE: Tastes better, yes. In talking to some ranchers over the years, they refer to people in San Rafael and Sausalito and those people over the hill don't know much. I sense that sometimes when I go to supervisors' meetings, most people think of Marin as -- ED: Peacocks and -- CE: Well, that terrible program, that‟s -- You're referring to that television show one October, peacock feathers and hot tubs. Well, that's one tenth of one percent of transients that flop into Sausalito. ED: Marin County is a really interesting place. CE: It's diverse there's no doubt about it. ED: Marin County has the highest income per capita of any county in California and it has the lowest fertility rate of any county in California. And I run counter to both of those. CE: What I'm trying to say, in a way, is that this Marin started long before we were a county and a state in 1850. Marin was a cow county. ED: That's right, exactly. CE: This is the most important thing about this county and all those peripheral interests: light industry, business, whatever you want to call it, along the bay on the other side of the hill, that could exist anywhere. This is what made the County. ED: That's right. CE: Do you feel you have proper representation over the hill with the governing bodies? ED: We have a tremendous educational project to achieve and I think we're making some inroads. We're making some inroads maybe because there are some selfish interests on the other side and they would like to see us remain as ranches so when they take their Sunday drive, we're the picture in the middle of their imaginary frame, and they love that. CE: How do you countenance the terrible developer mentality who wants to see all this land and do something with it. Do they -- Are they coming in every once in awhile and making little inquiries, or does this Marin Agricultural Land Trust help you in that? ED: It helps us to some degree. CE: Are you a member of that? ED: I am a member. I am the vice chairman. CE: Oh, good for you. Would you tell us what that MALT -- It's not very old, is it? ED: No. CE: What is its mission? ED: It's in its infancy. CE: Infancy, it's a baby. ED: Yes. CE: Do you ranchers get together now?  ED: It is made up of a heterogeneous group in a sense that we have professional people on it. Mrs. Martinelli's son is a member. There is no membership per say. These are directors. We have some conservationists on it, we have some ranchers on it. So it's a mixed group. CE: And its mission is to do what? ED: First I should say it is non-profit and it is private. And its mission is to try to continue the agricultural industry in Marin County. CE: Is Ralph Grossi a member of that? ED: Ralph Grossi is a member. CE: I interviewed him. He impressed me very much. ED: Yes, he was the first chairman that we had. GM: What are those initials? ED: MALT. CE: Do you have any idea how many ranchers are out here in this beautiful area? Do you have any idea? ED: Yes, and I can't recall, but there are -- CE: A hundred? Sixty? ED: No, I think it's maybe like sixty-something at this point. There are, I think, a hundred and twenty-six thousand acres. CE: Still in agriculture? ED: Yes. CE: Great. ED: We have lost a great number in the last twenty years. CE: You mean because of Point Reyes National Seashore, GGNRA, and things like that? ED: That's one reason. There are other reasons. The encroachment of people and they need space. And the other thing is that when a ranch changes hands, by and large, the new owner is not a rancher. CE: Does the taxation formula apply to ranches as it does to home owners? Like, do you have to pay the current price of your ranch? ED: No, we are fairly well insulated from that, in that we have what we call the Williamson Act. And if you operate your ranch as a ranch, you are supposed to be taxed for its capacity to produce as a ranch. CE: Well, why the attraction, in your judgment, for a non-rancher to own a ranch? Just like they buy wineries in the Napa Valley and play at it? ED: Well, number one, cowboy boots have become very popular. The first thing they buy are boots. CE: Then the hat. ED: The hat comes later, yes, and then, later on, the ranch. Actually, it's probably due to the success of the Marlboro ads. CE: I love it. Are there a few of those? ED: Oh, we have a lot of it. It's serious. CE: Do they hurt themselves? Do they trip over their own mistakes? ED: Not enough of them. Some of them do, but not enough of them. You know they think they're going to come out here and cut a fat hog. They're going to get in the cattle business and they're really going to make some money. And they find out  how little money they make and they say, "Boy, this is no fun." I can name names but I don't want to. CE: Yeah, don't. Just like the fellows who came for gold. They thought it was just going to flow in the stream. And twelve hours a day in cold water with your feet in that stream, it's no fun, it's hard work. ED: The ranch right next to me has changed hands three times in the last twelve years. I generally give them six to eight years, but they've been proving me wrong, most of them only last about four. CE: Fascinating. ED: You know agricultural land generally in the United States is decreasing in price. And the only thing that I can attribute that to is that the salaries and commissions of the professional and corporate people must be going down. CE: It appears to me that these people sort of, who buy these ranches want to become country squires. ED: That's true. And also, take the Nicasio area for instance, George Lucas comes in and -- CE: Oh yes, you've got to talk about George. ED: George Lucas comes in and he buys I don't know how many thousand acres he has now, close to, maybe over three, close to four. And what happens is that there's a following. They don't necessarily have to be a George Lucas-type or even in the same industry. CE: But it gives somebody else an idea. ED: Yes, and they like to be, you know, “I live in the George Lucas area.” It has a status to it. Status is important to some people who don't have enough confidence in themselves as individuals. CE: Did you, like your father and grandfather ahead of you, educate your children away from the area? ED: Yes, to a degree. CE: If they wanted it. ED: Yes. This was something not new in our family. It's like in my immediate family, my brothers and sisters, there's six of us, and we all went to college for four years and none of us went to the same school. CE: Where did you go? ED: I went to St. Mary's. CE: St. Mary's in Moraga? ED: Yes. CE: That's a great school, too. ED: And I have encouraged my children to go to school. They all haven't gone but -- CE: Do they ask you, like your sons, "Well, why, Dad? I know what I'm doing here." ED: I think it's a lot more accepted today than it was in my time, because, in my time, we were some of the few that went, you know, from this agricultural area. CE: Well, I know the world, through the communication media, has become so much more available. Knowledge has become so prevalent and a person with -- Just observing in your home, the taste you have, and the interests, become greater than they used to be. You have a beautiful stereo set. ED: You can blame my wife for that.  CE: All right, it's part of your life too. Your children have been exposed to it. You haven't gone for the computer yet, have you? ED: No, in fact somebody asked me that question the other day and I said, "Heavens no, I was thinking of having the telephone taken out." CE: Good. Everywhere you go now they have a computer in the room. And I had that enough with the Navy. ED: My oldest daughter, Ann, graduated from U.C. Davis. CE: In agriculture? ED: No, she's a journalist. She's an English major. CE: Where? ED: She's a reporter for a newspaper now. CE: Is she? In this area? ED: In Novato. In fact, this week she's the editor because the editor is on vacation. CE: Is she married? ED: No. CE: What's her name? ED: Ann. CE: Ann, great. ED: Joan graduated from Cal Poly in San Luis Obispo. CE: That's an agricultural school. ED: Yes, but she was a graphics major. And she married a gentleman who is in that field also, and they live in San Luis Obispo. They have a business there. CE: Good. ED: And then Peggy graduated from U.C. Irvine. CE: Boy, they went to different schools, you‟re right, all over the state. GM: How can you keep track of them? ED: And she majored in psychology and she got a masters at San Diego State and now she's working for her doctorate at U.C. in San Francisco, toward her doctorate. CE: Does she live in the city, or -- ED: She lives in San Francisco. CE: Comes home weekends I imagine. ED: Yes. CE: Now your boys -- ED: Tim was the next one and Tim chose not to go to school. And he stayed and worked on the dairy with us and, wouldn't you know, last January he says -- he‟s twenty five now -- he says, "I think I'd like to go back to school." CE: Well, he wants to do it when he has the feeling for it. ED: Yes, that's right, when you're ready. Philip was the next one. Philip graduated from Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo, and he's working with us on the dairy. Mimi is the next one and she chose not to go to college, she's going to travel agency school right now, so we'll see what happens with that. And then the other two, one is in high school, Sam, and Becky is ten, she's still in grade school. C.E: And what's your wife's name again? E.D: Mary Margaret. C.E: I'm sorry we don't have the pleasure of meeting her today. Does this home reflect her?  E.D: I would say yes. C.E: It's just beautiful, everything. Does she like ranch life too? E.D: Probably has had a hard time to adapt to it. Her father was a dentist and had a very structured life. You know, you worked these days, you did not work those days, your patients were all scheduled. And we have a very non-scheduled type of business. C.E: What are her interests outside of family? Does she -- Is she musical? I see this beautiful piano. E.D: I love to hear a piano. We've been trying and trying and trying to get some of the children to get really proficient at it. CE: What's the story of that beautiful grand? ED: That came out of a bar in San Francisco and I wish you could have seen it. It had cigarette burns all over it. CE: A bar? ED: Yes, a bar. It was just a mess. CE: It's a great thing. I thought it might have come around the Horn or something. ED: No. CE: Well, in closing, we've taken up quite a bit of your morning here. In closing, Earl, what would you like to see evolve or be accomplished during your lifetime and through your children? You don't want any more ranches, do you? ED: Well, it just depends on how many children you have interested in ranching and if it's economically feasible. It doesn't appear to be right now. It is a life that I have enjoyed so much that I would like to be able to let my children have that opportunity if they want it, only if they want it. They don't have to do it. If they want to do something else that's perfectly all right. But the opportunity was given to me and I have really enjoyed it and so, I, in turn, would like to see if I can't pass that on. CE: And this is your home and this is your life and this is where you want to be. ED: Right. CE: Well, it is certainly reflected in you. You're a very happy man. Thank you for letting us come in briefly. ED: You're welcome.
